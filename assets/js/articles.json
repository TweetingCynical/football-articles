      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is considering ambitious plans to build a new stadium for Manchester United as he prepares to complete his deal for a 25 percent stake in the Premier League giants",
      "Erik ten Hag has backed Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ambitious plans to transform Old Trafford into the 'Wembley of the North'.",
      "Ratcliffe is waiting for his deal for a 25 percent stake in Manchester United to be ratified. The British billionaire will take over control of all football matters at the Red Devils and has also been asked by the Glazers to have a say over broader issues.",
      "One of the most pressing problems for Ratcliffe to deal with is the club's infrastructure. Old Trafford is beginning to grow tired and has been overtaken by many other stadiums, such as Tottenham's.",
      "As part of his deal, Ratcliffe will invest more than £200million in infrastructure improvements. But he is also thought to be ready to go further and build a new stadium altogether to give United a world-class base.",
      "The option of building a new ground would likely cost in the region of £2billion. But Ratcliffe is thought to be hopeful of using Government funding to absorb at least some of that cost.",
      "He has already met local political leaders to lay the ground for the proposals and believes that supporters will get on board despite the historical attachment to Old Trafford. Ratcliffe will certainly be able to bank on the backing of current boss Ten Hag though.",
      "\"If that is his view, then I would say it expresses the ambition of this club, which is good. But further on, it is not my task in this club to deal with stadium questions and facilities. My job is to perform the team, to manage the team, to build the squad,\" the Dutchman said.",
      "Ten Hag will now be focusing on United's trip to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday. The Red Devils are looking to close the eight-point gap on Villa, who currently occupy the final Champions League qualification spot.",
      "Ratcliffe moved a step closer to completing his deal on Monday when United sharefolders approved a special resolution that means the Class B shares he is buying and carry more voting rights would not convert to Class A shares when they were transferred to him.",
      "He has already written to the Manchester United Supporters Trust to lay out his plans for the club. The billionaire has insisted he knows the responsibility he is taking on by taking on a leading role at the Red Devils.",
      "\"I wanted to write to you at this time given the critical role of the fans to the future of Manchester United as we recognise our responsibility as custodians of the Club on your behalf,\" the letter read.",
      "\"I believe we can bring sporting success on the pitch to complement the undoubted commercial success that the club has enjoyed. It will require time and patience alongside rigour and the highest level of professional management.",
      "\"You are ambitious for Manchester United and so are we. There are no guarantees in sport, and change can inevitably take time but we are in it for the long term and together we want to help take Manchester United back to where the club belongs, at the very top of English, European and World Football. I take that responsibility very seriously.\""

      "JOHN CROSS COLUMN: There is a feeling among the Big Six that transfers windows in the future will see a seismic change in the next few years which will see a regular pattern of big-spending in the summer and fewer deals in January",
      "The January transfer window was a complete departure from the past - but Premier League clubs are convinced it is here to stay.",
      "Incredibly, top-flight clubs only spent £100m last month compared to a record-breaking £830m the previous year. Clearly, it was partly driven by Profit and Sustainability Rules which hamstrung big clubs like Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle and Aston Villa in terms of what they could spend.",
      "But all of those clubs are gearing up for a much bigger window this summer when the shackles come off again because effectively PSR resets and allows them to balance the books again. Prem clubs are also set to vote through increased PSR figures from the outdated losses limit of £105m over three years which were set more than a decade ago.",
      "But there is certainly a feeling among the Big Six that transfers windows in the future will see a seismic change in the next few years which will see a regular pattern of big-spending in the summer and fewer deals in January. That is the pattern within other major leagues in Europe who often look at the Premier League and see a crazy and panic-buy approach to January.",
      "‌Arsenal want a centre forward while United boss Erik ten Hag has insisted he wanted another striker while Newcastle are having to grow steadily because of PSR but want to go big and improve.",
      "The other issue affecting PSR is that several clubs have complained that until they know the exact figures and implications then they cannot budget for a new financial deal for the EFL and the rest of the football pyramid.",
      "It is the smaller clubs who are digging in particularly hard over how the deal will be funded, even if the long drawn out process is certain to have a negative effect on how the Premier League is viewed.",
      "Clubs are also watching with great interest about Chelsea’s spending and whether they will scrape inside PSR after £1billion worth of spending under owner Todd Boehly.",
      "Chelsea have been keen to stress they will meet the guidelines but their willingness to cash in on homegrown talents Conor Gallagher and Armando Broja - who eventually went out on loan to Fulham - suggest they are nervous.‌",
      "Ivan Toney was again subjected to racist abuse online and the issue feels harder than ever to solve. However, the Premier League have been making inroads since 2019 in trying to track down, catch and potentially take action against the abusers.",
      "They also set up a reporting system for players, managers and their families in 2020 and in 2023 it was the extended to allow fans to report any abuse they saw towards players.",
      "Prem bosses have had successes with a previous case of abuse towards Toney led to a man in North Shields being given a four year suspended sentence and a three year stadium ban. In 2021, a man in Singapore was prosecuted after they traced online abuse towards Neal Maupay.",
      "There was a recent case involving a Newcastle fan in which the club had contacted the Premier League. They then provided a full report on online comments made in an open forum of social media, so it does seem strange there has been criticism of this process.",
      "The Premier League are endeavouring to take action against online abuse. They are trying to identify issues and ultimately it was Newcastle who imposed a two-year stadium on the supporter.‌‌",
      "TV watchdogs have successfully prosecuted an illegal streaming boss which led to him being given a 12-month prison sentence and had £91,000 of earnings confiscated.",
      "Paul Merrell, a 42-year-old resident of Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, ran a “sophisticated” operation for four years illegally showing Premier League games in one of the biggest ever streaming offences.",
      "Brighton face Tottenham on Saturday and, if things had worked out differently, it could have been Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou in the away dugout.",
      "Brighton were big admirers of Postecoglou and were more than likely to have moved for the former Celtic boss if they had not got Roberto De Zerbi to replace Graham Potter.",

      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has defended his decision to keep Lisandro Martinez on the pitch after he went down injured against West Ham.",
      "Martinez has been ruled out for two months after suffering a sprained collateral ligament in the 3-0 win over the Hammers on Sunday. The Argentina international had only just returned from a three-month injury lay-off, but is now set for another spell on the sidelines at United.",
      "It is a bitter blow for Ten Hag, who decided to leave Martinez on the pitch after he went down in pain while trying to usher the ball out of play. Martinez tried to run the injury off – something that perhaps now looks careless on Ten Hag’s part.",
      "“It was Lisandro's decision,” Ten Hag said. “It was impossible to diagnose in two minutes. He was not comfortable to be back on the pitch. He tried and stopped in the next attack.”",
      "Speaking at a press conference ahead of the Premier League game against Aston Villa on Sunday, he added: “It is a big setback for Licha, he is very disappointed but he is a fighter. He will be back stronger and will play by the end of the season.”",
      "United only got four matches out Martinez upon his return, after he was originally picked up a foot injury in the 4-3 defeat by Bayern Munich on September 20. The 26-year-old is first-choice in central defence when available, with Ten Hag preferring to partner him with Raphael Varane when both are fit.",
      "That has unfortunately become a rarity for United, who also have Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof as experienced specialists at centre-back. Ten Hag has also previously fielded Luke Shaw as a left-sided centre-back – and he hinted he might do so again.",
      "\"We have options,” he said. “How to deal with that position. We have good centre-halves in our squad so the others are available, Luke can also play there. I’m quite confident we can keep the process going so others can fulfil the position and also contribute playing at high levels.",
      "“Those players are experienced. That is an advantage that we have seen [left-footed player in that role]. We have to work on players. They can also develop in such positions when you work with them and coach with them and train them. I see our players in the back line developing their skills when building up.\"",
      "Martinez has vowed to return stronger next time. \"I want to give a heartfelt thanks for the great support I've received and to reassure you that I'll soon be back out there, and we'll fight together. Always united!\" he tweeted.",

      "According to reliable sources, a billionaire Monaco tax exile - soon to take part-ownership of the club alongside a family of American tycoons - is thinking of asking for help from British taxpayers to turn Old Trafford into a ‘Wembley of the North’.",
      "Good luck with that, Sir Jim.",
      "Surely even this shameless government would not take money from its hard-up loyal citizens to give to a bloke in Monte Carlo worth £30billion in order to help ease the financial burden of a vanity project. If Ratcliffe, presumably with the blessing of the Glazers, wants to rebuild Old Trafford - or knock it down and build a new stadium - then it is not too rich to suggest he uses his own and Manchester United’s cash.",
      "The suggestion is that Ratcliffe might try and explore the possibility of a grant from the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - a typically wishy-washy talking shop that does very little. How about levelling up on the pitch first?",
      "Hands up, having never been a paying punter at Old Trafford, I have no firm grasp of how outdated the old stadium has become.",
      "I know how shocking the logistics of getting to and from the place are, and, from the testimony of many United-supporting friends, I know the catering leaves a lot to be desired, the access to seats is not great and the loos are out of date.",
      "But Old Trafford remains an iconic arena, with the sort of storied history that few can rival, here or abroad. And let’s face it, we all know what really makes a great stadium … and it’s not craft ale outlets, escalators, high-speed wifi, gourmet food, Beyonce concerts and extra legroom.",
      "It is a great team.",
      "If this was a majestic United vintage, playing front-foot football, blowing opponents away as they once did, we would not hear of the leaky roof or the dodgy burgers. The noise about the infrastructure would be drowned out by the euphoria of 70,000 delirious supporters.",
      "Yes, every business - including and, perhaps, especially sporting businesses - has to move with the times and age takes its toll on any building.",
      "But renovation of one of world football’s most celebrated landmarks is surely the way forward, as it was for Liverpool and Anfield.",
      "Even to the untrained eye, Old Trafford does not look beyond renovation and improvement in the same way that, say, Goodison Park most clearly does.",
      "And, of course, the renovation and improvement that is more urgently needed when Monaco Jim officially gets his slice of the club is to a squad that has lost nine of its 23 Premier League games this season, has a negative goal difference and left European competition at the earliest possible moment.",
      "By all means, address the obvious issues that a stadium and its surroundings will face after so many years of existence.",
      "But build a team that would be fit to grace a so-called ‘Wembley of the North’ before building the thing itself.",

      "The annual UEFA congress was held in Paris on Thursday and as part of a bundle of statutory reforms, the UEFA presidency term limit was extended beyond the previous three terms, which will allow Aleksander Ceferin to retain power for an unprecedented fourth term",
      "The Football Association were alone in voting against a controversial reform that would allow UEFA president, Aleksander Čeferin, to run for an unprecedented fourth term.",
      "All 55 of the continent’s 55 member states voted on the statutory changes, and while they were expected to pass overwhelmingly, the FA’s stance against Čeferin's plans is viewed as a significant and rare breaking from ranks in the wake of ongoing disquiet within the governing body.",
      "The FA cut a lonely figure in dissenting against Čeferin. FA chief executive Mark Bullingham was the sole national federation delegate to hold up a red card rejecting the amendments, but the motion passed with 49 of the 55 associations holding up a green card in support.",
      "While the Football Association of Wales was understood to have considered taking a stand, along with a Ukrainian federation newly fronted by Andriy Shevchenko, the majority of member states and committee members voted in favour of Čeferin's plans.",
      "The amendment would have allowed Čeferin to hold the presidential office for longer than the previously permitted 12-year tenure... only for him to declare he was quitting anyway and that it was all a test.",
      "“I decided six months ago that I would not run any more. The reason is that after some time every organisation needs fresh blood, but mainly because I was away from my family for seven years now,” the Slovenian said at a press conference after the Congress.",
      "“I intentionally didn’t want to disclose my thoughts before, because firstly, I wanted to see the real face of some people, and I saw it. I have a beautiful life in football, I have a beautiful life outside of football as well.”",
      "The statutory change permitting Čeferin an extension on his presidency was bundled into a wider reform package, which included expanding the number of women who sit on UEFA’s executive committee (the current number is one) and clarification over the jurisdiction and consequences for potential breakaway competitions such as the European Super League.",
      "Member states were asked to vote on the bundled nature of the package, meaning only one vote was permitted to pass all of the reforms. Only England, Norway and Iceland voted against the bundling of the reforms, though ultimately voted in favour of the final reform package. Ukraine opted to abstain from voting.",
      "The bundling nature is believed to have increased the likelihood that Čeferin's desired term reform would receive widespread ratification, because while many federations were understood to be uncomfortable with this prospect, in the wake of ongoing turmoil from outside UEFA including the ever-simmering threat of a European Super League, a unified and pragmatic stance was viewed as paramount.",
      "The FA’s opposition vote, while singular in its existence, is not viewed as directly in opposition to Čeferin but rather the principle of his prolonged governance. The vote is also in keeping with the view of UEFA executive committee body treasure and FA vice-chairman David Gill, who has harboured concerns that an extension could see European football’s governing body slip back into the old habits which defined Platini’s time in charge.",
      "Even so, the votes cast at Maison de la Mutualite on Thursday were in overwhelming support for the changes. The passing of the proposal is viewed as a bizarre victory for Čeferin, whose move mirrored that of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who encouraged the FIFA Council to rule last year that his first 39 months in office did not count because he had stepped in to replace Blatter, clearing the way for him to stay in charge until 2031.",
      "Čeferin's reform arrives shortly after the UEFA chief made big statements regarding financial fair play (FFP). The Premier League's recent history has seen clubs found in contravention of profitability and sustainability rules (PSRs). Along with a separate Manchester City case alleging the club routinely broke financial regulations, Ceferin also opened up on UEFA's own incident regarding the current domestic and European champions.",
      "In an interview with the Telegraph, Čeferin previously claimed that City were definitely guilty of breaking their own monetary rules in a separate case in 2018. Pep Guardiola's side were sanctioned at the time, being kicked out of European competition, before the decision was overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).",
      "“We know we were right,\" Čeferin said. \"We wouldn’t decide if we didn’t think we were right.”",
      "He added: “As a trial lawyer for 25 years, I know that, sometimes, you win a case that you are sure you will lose. And, sometimes, you lose a case when you’re sure. You just simply have to respect in a serious democracy the decision of the court.",
      "“I don’t want to speak about the case in England. But I trust that the decision of our independent body was correct. I didn’t enter into this decision.”"

      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville played for Manchester United in the mid-2000s and they say there was widespread suspicion among players about opponents at Italian clubs they faced",
      "Manchester United players were suspicious some opponents at Italian sides they played in the Champions League were doping, according to Roy Keane and Gary Neville.",
      "Keane and Neville were key players in Sir Alex Ferguson ’s side, who were at the top of the European game in the mid-2000s. Their success in the Premier League qualified them to take on the best teams on the continent in the Champions League.",
      "And while United could compete against the teams from Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands and beyond, there was a taboo subject they were aware of. Although they kept their thoughts to themselves, Neville has now revealed that he and his team-mates thought players at some Italian sides were doping to improve their physical performance.",
      "“There’s a couple that stick in my mind – and I’m going to say this very [carefully] for legal reasons – I think there were a few teams that we played against that weren’t clean,” he said on the Stick to Football podcast. “We thought it at the time.”",
      "Ian Wright then asked: “What, were they too pumped up?” Jamie Carragher added: “It must be the Italian teams?”",
      "Keane responded: “Certain teams, I would be walking off and I’d be absolutely shattered and, again, I remember it. And I’d be looking at players I played against – a couple of Italian teams – and they looked like they’d not even played a match. Why can’t we talk about that?”",
      "Neville added: “I don’t know. I can’t accuse people… We’re not naming names or clubs. But my point is, when you look back now, what came out after in cycling and other sports with doctors and you think ‘hang on’.",
      "“We thought at the time that there were things like, I’m sorry, physically, we were fit. We weren’t drinkers. We were fit. That’s not right. There’s something not right. I came off the pitch against an Italian team and thought ‘that’s not right’. I’m sorry. And I know that a couple of the other lads, [in the] mid-2000s thought exactly the same thing.”",
      "Speaking more generally about United, former Liverpool defender Carragher added: “Obviously, Manchester United had the domination in the Premier League, but they never had that domination in Europe, that they should’ve. They won two Champions Leagues, but they were so far apart from each other that it wasn’t an era of it.”",
      "Neville played for United from 1992 until 2011, helping Ferguson’s side win the Champions League in 1998/99 and 2007/08. The former right-back had a quirk to his European career. “I don’t think I ever played against an English team in Europe, ever,” he said. “I played over 100 games in the Champions League – obviously I didn’t play in the final [Manchester United vs Chelsea ] – I was injured in 2008.”"

      "\"It's a great challenge. In the first game we played against Cyprus, which was in their home country and we won 3-0. The next game felt like a derby because England v Scotland has a lot of history to it.",

      "\"I feel really proud to represent my country. It's what I've wanted to do since I was a kid. It's amazing going out there; playing for your country and making your family proud is a good feeling.\"",
      "Although Amass never made a senior appearance for Watford, he did make the bench last season when they were beaten 2-0 by Reading in the third round of the FA Cup. \"The first-team experience was surreal,\" he admitted.",
      "\"You're playing with footballers you see on TV! I had a couple of training sessions with them and got used to it, and being on the bench and seeing the fans was really good.\""

      "Manchester United's kit for the 2024-25 season has seemingly been leaked on social media, with fans spotting a rather familiar feature.",
      "The current Premier League season is still three months away from ending, but it seems that the outfit for Erik ten Hag's team next season may have already been revealed. The club's current shirt sponsorship deal with TeamViewer is nearing its end, and California-based company Qualcomm Technologies will have their 'Snapdragon' brand emblazoned on the front of the shirts for the upcoming season.",

      "The home shirt features a black stripe rising from the bottom two corners, with two more black tags at the armpit point. Alongside Adidas' iconic three stripes on the shoulders, the kit also sports a black and white sleeve ending - reminiscent of the 2017-18 home shirt.",
      "Fans have also noted that the Snapdragon logo bears a resemblance to the Vodafone sponsor on United's shirts from 2000-2006, back when they were under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson. Unsurprisingly, supporters are saying that the leaked shirt looks similar to the 2002-03 and 2003-04 home shirts, the strips worn by United in David Beckham's final season for the club and Cristiano Ronaldo's first.",

      "Jose Mourinho left Paul Pogba out of his Manchester United side because he knew it would force the club to sack him, according to Richard Keys.",
      "Mourinho was sacked by United in December 2018 after a 3-1 defeat by Liverpool left them 11 points adrift of the top four in the Premier League. The sacking of Mourinho and five of his staff after United’s worst start to a campaign in 28 years cost the club £19.6million in compensation.",
      "Pogba – United’s £89m club-record signing – was left out of the team against Liverpool and in the preceding two matches after a breakdown in relationship between the two. Former Sky Sports presenter Keys claims that Mourinho left the Frenchman out with the intention that it would anger his bosses and force their hand.",
      "Keys wrote in his blog : “Jose Mourinho once called Arsene Wenger ‘an expert in failure’. The irony is that it was Mourinho who went on to become the expert – racking up £80m in pay-offs!",
      "“His latest sacking in Rome followed the usual pattern – row, rant, then retreat with the money. He once told me he knew he’d be sacked at United for leaving Pogba out of three consecutive games – at a time when the Frenchman’s stock was at its highest. All planned. And it worked perfectly. He wanted the sack. He got it.",
      "“Never mind that he went on to say that his biggest regret at Old Trafford wasn’t that he should have left at the end of the first season – but taking the job in the first place. How does that sit with those suggesting he’s got ‘unfinished business’ at United?”",
      "Mirror Football have contacted Mourinho’s representatives to request comment. He was sacked by Roma on January 16, leaving the Italian club ninth in Serie A and out of the Coppa Italia following a defeat by rivals Lazio. The 61-year-old spent two and a half years with Roma, helping win the Europa Conference League title.",
      "The Portuguese manager certainly did have a fractious relationship with Pogba in the final months of his time at United. He did not even speak to Pogba in the final week of his tenure and had completely lost the dressing room, with the atmosphere immediately improved once Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was installed as interim boss.",
      "Speaking in 2021, Pogba opened up on the problems between the two. \"Once I had a great relationship with Mourinho, everybody saw that, and the next day you don't know what happened,” he said. “That's the strange thing I had with Mourinho and I cannot explain to you because even I don't know. So, yeah.\"",

      "As much as their ability on the pitch, it was the standards set by United's squad off it that enabled them to dominate English football for two decades. Erik ten Hag has worked hard to restore that culture of discipline to United, going in hard on players who step out of line or put their own interests above those of the team.",
      "As Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho have found to their cost, Ten Hag has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to fragile egos, with both offloaded when they publicly undermined him. Marcus Rashford's boozy Belfast bender suggested Ten Hag still has work to do when it comes to such standards, even though the forward is said to have “taken responsibility for his actions”.",
      "Former United stars Gary Neville and Roy Keane helped forge that strong dressing-room culture under Ferguson, with both questioning who is fulfilling that leadership role in the current squad.",
      "\"It’s a massive factor, the dressing room that you come into as a young player and the influence and standard bearers in the dressing-room,” said Neville. \"These United lads who have come through in the last five to eight years, if you’re a young lad coming through at Liverpool and Manchester City, you’ve got a good chance, whereas if you’re at United now, you’re thinking 'who is guiding that dressing room?'",

      "“I thought all these players were brilliant professionals, and I looked around and thought what a great group of people. Players like Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, all amazing professional players. Remember the Cliff, our old training ground in Salford? I’d come in for a big fee at the time, but I was looking around the group and even the chat and the banter was great.",
      "“My first pre-season we went to South Africa, and I couldn’t believe how brilliant it was and how good the players were. We’re talking about plenty of players when we played who would happily give tough love, but clearly no-one is doing that at United for Marcus and that is one of the problems that the team has - they don’t have that core group of players.”",
      "Ex-Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said Rashford needs to improve his body language on the pitch and follow the example set by Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "“I’m not saying Rashford needs to go round shouting at everyone, but his body language needs to change and be the person you want him to be when someone becomes a leader,” said Carragher. When I’m watching Trent this season, even though his numbers might be the same, it’s his body language and change in demeanour on the pitch which has changed as he’s getting older.”",

      "Lingard is on the verge of signing a two-year deal with Seoul after flying out on Sunday to agree terms and complete a medical. This is set to be Lingard's first move since leaving Nottingham Forest last summer. The 31-year-old spent one season at The City Ground following his departure from United.",
      "According to Chosun Ilbo, via Korea JoongAng Daily - two of Korea's leading news outlets - Lingard is set to become the highest-paid player in the K League. He is in line to earn £17,500 per week, which is a massive drop from the £180,000 per week he was collecting at Forest.",
      "It means Lingard is set to collect £910,000 per year as he prepares to join Seoul after receiving offers from as many as 25 clubs from around the world. Lazio were amongst the other teams to show interest in Lingard, who trained at Inter Miami, West Ham and Al-Ettifaq in an attempt to keep fit after leaving Forest.",
      "Last week, Seoul manager Kim Gi-dong confirmed that talks had been taking place for Lingard, who has not played a competitive game since coming off the bench for Forest against United last April. He said: \"I heard about it two to three weeks ago and I thought it was unrealistic.",
      "\"I asked our director of football about it and he replied to me: yes, it's true, we are in contact with the player, but the deal is not confirmed yet. If he comes, of course, it would be great for K-League as more foreign fans would be interested in our league. And if he comes as he was not playing for a while, we need to give him time to adapt rather than expect an instant impact.'\"",
      "On Sunday night, Lingard posted a photo on his Instagram story at the airport with luggage as he prepared to check in for a Korean Air flight. When he arrived Lingard was mobbed by fans at Incheon airport and was handed a flute as a bizarre welcome present. The thought process behind the gift was one of Lingard's memorable celebrations, which saw him play the musical instrument after scoring.",
      "FC Seoul are six-time K League champions and have reached the final of the Asian Champions League twice. They start their 2024 campaign off with a trip to Gwangju on March 2."

      "Asuilio said, via Fabrizio Romano: \"I'm sure we will reach an agreement as we both want to continue together. It's just about being patient.\" Martinez joined Inter from Racing Club for around £19million in 2018 and he has since gone on to become one of Inter's most important players.",
      "After struggling to find his feet in his first season, Martinez went on to form a dynamic partnership with Romelu Lukaku and the pair helped fire Inter to the Europa League final in 2020.

      "After that he headed to mainland Europe, moving to Slovakian side Pohronie, where he spent two years. He then had a stint at MTK Budapest in Hungary before returning to Slovakia once again. That proved to be his final switch with Weir hanging up his boots well before his 30th birthday.",
      "He posted on Instagram: \"Life update. After a lot of thought and consideration, I’ve decided to hang up my boots professionally. A bittersweet moment, but I can look back on my career with happy memories. Despite my injuries, I’ve met some incredible people, forged life-long relationships and travelled the world doing what I love.",
      "\"Huge thank you to family, friends, coaches, teammates and fans who’ve all helped me on my journey. Through the highs, lows and everything in between, I’ve lived my dream. I’m excited in the pursuit of living my next dream away from the beautiful game.\"",
      "Van Gaal gifted a host of youngsters their opportunities whilst he was in charge in Manchester. The Dutchman was more than happy to trust in youth with Rashford his biggest success story. He also handed out debuts to the likes of Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Tyler Blackett.",
      "Jesse Lingard's first United appearance came as a result of Van Gaal with the midfielder going on to become a major player during his tenure, scoring the winner in the FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace back in 2016."

However, Van Persie rejected the offer because he wanted to continue developing at Feyenoord and did not want to uproot his family.",

      "Argentina international Lo Celso returned to Tottenham over the summer after 18 months away on loan, showing signs of a renaissance with goals in successive games against Aston Villa and Manchester City. He got a run in the side when James Maddison was out injured, but Maddison's return has coincided with an injury for Lo Celso himself.",
      "His injury is not thought to be long-term, with (you guessed it) Galatasaray linked with a move in the Turkish press. Former Spurs men Vinicius and Sanchez are already at the club, while Tanguy Ndombele joined on loan from the London club last summer, though Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou's recent comment about Lo Celso don't sound like the words of a man desperate to sell.",

      "Forgotten man Sarr was moments from leaving Chelsea for Le Havre at the end of the Premier League window, only for the move to collapse. “It is shameful what they did to him,” the French side's sporting director Mathieu Bodmer said (as translated by Get French Football News), with the Blues accused of failing to submit the relevant documents in time.",

      "In the end, the former Bournemouth man stayed on Merseyside and Lyon looked elsewhere. The Ligue 1 strugglers spent big in January, with Gift Orban bolstering their attacking ranks and Said Benrahma completing a last-minute loan from West Ham.",

      "Roy Keane enjoyed a brilliant career at Manchester United and was captain for their best-ever season, but the Republic of Ireland midfielder has one major regret",
      "Roy Keane has admitted he was heartbroken to miss Manchester United’s famous Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999.",
      "United won the Treble in the 1998/99 season, with Sir Alex Ferguson ’s side claiming the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League trophies. It was an impressive achievement that has gone down in the club’s history and made the squad revered by fans.",
      "Keane was captain of the team and played in the 2-0 win over Newcastle in the FA Cup final on May 22, but like Paul Scholes, was unable to take the field four days later in Barcelona. The Republic of Ireland international was injured at Wembley, so might have been unavailable anyway, but he still felt the pain of missing the iconic match, which saw United score twice in added time to come from behind and beat Bayern 2-1.",
      "Asked on the Stick to Football podcast whether he had a sinking feeling about missing the game, Keane replied: “Yes, you do. The standard answer when people ask you is, ‘That’s life,’ but it’s heartbreaking when you miss a big game like that.",
      "“Your mindset at the time is that you’re United, competing, and you’re convinced that you’ll get back to another final, but you don’t. Scholesy did eventually get back to another one, I didn’t, and that’s the reality and brutal side of the game. You can’t be suspended now [for a final], just my luck that.”",
      "Keane travelled with the squad to Barcelona and was there to witness his team making history thanks to Teddy Sheringham’s equaliser and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer ’s winner. But he allowed stand-in skipper Peter Schmeichel to lift the trophy, insisting he wouldn’t feel comfortable doing so himself after not playing.",
      "“No, I don’t agree with that,” he explained. “I’m not against other people doing it, but at the time I would have been really embarrassed, cringing to be honest. We went down at the end, me and Scholesy, but that was late into it and even then, I was thinking, ‘really,’ cringing.”",
      "Gary Neville played in the Champions League final for United and thinks the win was even more special because of absences of Keane and Scholes, who was also suspended. He said: “We only found out a couple of weeks before that Roy and Scholes couldn’t play but because all the games we had left were the FA Cup final and last game of the season, we couldn’t practise with the team, we had no games in hand to work with.”",
      "Neville felt the team “were all over the place” towards the end while chasing the game, with Ferguson throwing on reinforcements in search of a goal. Ryan Giggs and David Beckham were among those forced to play out of position due to Keane and Scholes not being available.",
      "“Giggsy was playing on the right that night, for 75 minutes – I never played with Giggsy [down the right side] in my life, and he’d never played with me,” he explained. “Yorke was upfront with Coley (Andy Cole), Jesper [Blomqvist] was on the left and Becks was in central midfield.”"

      "As part of our collaboration with WhoScored, Mirror Football looks at the emergence of the Manchester United midfielder, who must be on the radar for Gareth Southgate ahead of the Euros",
      "It may have been overlooked over the weekend but Jordan Henderson made his debut for Ajax on Saturday.",
      "The 33-year-old left Al-Ettifaq after just six months in Saudi Arabia in a move that tarnished his reputation. One person who didn't miss Ajax's Eredivisie meeting with PSV, though, was England boss Gareth Southgate.",
      "In attendance at the Johan Cruyff Arena, Southgate wouldn't have seen anything he didn't already know about Henderson, who was, as is to be expected, tidy in possession in the 1-1 draw. Southgate would have been better off saving his air miles and making the trip to Old Trafford instead.",
      "While Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund stole the plaudits for their respective performances in front of goal, the 3-0 win over West Ham marked yet another solid display from Kobbie Mainoo in the middle of the park. Fresh from netting a late winner at Wolves on Thursday night, Mainoo put in another fine showing, this time alongside Casemiro, up until his withdrawal midway through the second half.",
      "Injury in pre-season delayed Mainoo's emergence on the scene but he's quickly getting to speed with the demands of regular senior football and maximising his opportunity to nail down a regular spot in the United midfield, not just for the rest of the season; but for years to come. Southgate could do a lot worse that follow suit and bring the teenage into the Three Lions fold sooner rather than later.",
      "Ghana are believed to be looking to sway the midfielder's international allegiance. \"The Ghana Football Association is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams. Kobbie is definitely one of these incredible talents,\" Randy Abbey, a member of the executive council of the Ghana FA, said recently. Best act fast then, Gareth!",
      "Having spent the bulk of Erik ten Hag's first summer in charge at Old Trafford actively pursuing Frenkie de Jong, they should have taken one glance at the academy to realise they had a midfielder on the books who would actively seek possession from the defence and drive the team forward. Ten Hag saw sense ahead of his second full season only for Mainoo to sustain an ankle injury against Real Madrid over the summer. Where might United be now had he been fit for the entirety of the campaign?",
      "The fact is, he's the perfect midfielder to help drive United on. An average of 0.9 dribbles per 90 is modest but then you have to remember this is a midfielder in his breakout campaign, one who might be more willing to play a safe option rather than get bullied off the ball in such a key area of the pitch.",
      "That he is being dispossessed just 0.9 times per 90 shows he can handle the physicality of England's top tier, this despite only turning 18 last April. England do have players prepared to receive the ball from the defence but the standout in this category is Declan Rice, and he's expected to anchor the midfield for the Three Lions this summer.",
      "In England's favoured three-man midfield, there is arguably a role for Mainoo in Southgate's preferred 4-3-3 setup. Henderson only has one top-flight European game under his belt this season while Kalvin Phillips has looked rusty in his two West Ham appearances following his arrival from Manchester City. By comparison, Mainoo looks scalpel sharp.",
      "On the ball, improvements are needed of course. England are a nation expected to dominate on the international stage but Mainoo has returned a pass success rate of just 85.3 per cent from 42.3 passes per 90 in the Premier League this season. This may be a reason why Southgate is reluctant to hand Mainoo international recognition just yet.",
      "The England boss wants control in games, a quality to the teenage midfielder's game that isn't presently quite up to the standard of his more senior compatriots. Of course this will improve in time and there's no doubt that Mainoo will become a fully fledged England international further down the line... provided Ghana don't swoop for the United star first.",
      "Nevertheless, he's proving the brain of this United midfield. While in an ideal world, Mainoo would have been eased into first-team action rather than thrown in at the deep and asked to sink or swim, of which he has done the latter.",
      "The next logical step is international recognition, which is likely to come sooner rather than later. If Southgate had any sense about him he'd be focussing his efforts on the future rather than spending his time watching midfielders who'll soon be part of the past."

      "Neville came through the famed United academy and made his debut in 1992 as part of a talented group of youngsters. The right-back was in the same crop as his brother Phil Neville, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs, who became known as the Class of 92.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was able to integrate the young players alongside established stars like Peter Schmeichel, Roy Keane, Steve Bruce, Denis Irwin and Paul Ince. Those players helped guide Neville and his peers, but he doesn’t think the current crop like Kobbie Mainoo have the same support system.",
      "“It’s a massive factor, the dressing room that you come into as a young player and the influence and standard bearers in the dressing room,” Neville said on the Stick to Football podcast. “These United lads who have come through in the last five to eight years, if you’re a young lad coming through at Liverpool and Manchester City you’ve got a good chance, whereas if you’re at United now, you’re thinking who's guiding that dressing room.”",
      "Mainoo has been one of the bright sparks for United this season, with the 18-year-old becoming a fixture in Erik ten Hag’s midfield. He is leading a group of young players who are pushing for starts, alongside the likes of Omari Forson, Willy Kambwala and Amad Diallo.",
      "Former United skipper Keane agrees with Neville’s assessment of the current crop under Ten Hag. He joined the club from Nottingham Forest in 1993 and was immediately struck by the atmosphere in the dressing room.",

      "“Remember the Cliff, our old training ground in Salford, I’d come in for a big fee at the time, but I was looking around the group and even the chat and the banter was great. My first pre-season we went to South Africa, and I couldn’t believe how brilliant It was and how good the players were.",
      "“We’re talking about plenty of players when we played who would happily give tough love, but clearly no one is doing that at Manchester United for Marcus Rashford and that is one of the problems that the team has, they don’t have that core group of players.”"

As a squad, we have to replace him and we have very good players in that position who can play there, will play there and will perform there. As a squad, we have to deal with it.",
      "\"Aaron Wan-Bissaka today was training but then he dropped out. So I don't know in this moment where he is, what the diagnosis is, hopefully not too bad. Mason and Ty are not ready to return to the squad.\"",
      "Martinez sustained the knee injury in the 66th minute of United's 3-0 win against West Ham last week but he attempted to continue playing until he was substituted in the 71st minute.",
      "Ten Hag denied the suggestion that Martinez had exacerbated his injury by heading back onto the pitch. \"I don’t think so but it was Lisandro's and he was not comfortable to be back on the pitch but after he tried and then he stopped in the next attack",
      "\"It is impossible, in some situations it is clear and obvious but there is always a grey area and it is very difficult to see from the sideline. what happened there.",
      "\"We have the screens and we see it as well and our medicals are over there, they communicate with the players. But to assess in one or two minutes is impossible. After a game, I can’t tell you. You need 24 hours minimum, maybe longer, so how can you tell in two minutes?\"",
      "Centre halves Varane, Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans are all expected to be in the squad against Villa while Luke Shaw excelled at centre back last season.",
      "Ten Hag prefers a right-footed and a left-footed partnership in defence but Malacia's long-term absence is likely to mean Shaw continues at left-back.",
      "\"We have options, how to deal with that position,\" Ten Hag noted. \"We have good centre-halves in our squad, so the others are all available, Luke can also play there, quite confident we can keep this process going and others can fulfil that position, contribute and play high levels, those players are good players and it's up to them.",
      "\"It's an advantage [to have a left-footer], we have seen but we have to work on players. Players can also develop in such positions when you work with them, coach with them and train them. I see our players in the back line make better decisions, I see that they develop their skills in building up. I'm quite confident we can keep this process of better ball-playing from the back going.\"",

      "The latest Manchester United news as the club's head of academy, Nick Cox, reveals how winger Garnacho was signed in 2020 despite the challenges of the Covid pandemic",
      "Manchester United’s head of academy Nick Cox has revealed how the club completed the signing of Alejandro Garnacho, even with the challenges of Covid.",
      "The Argentine joined the club as a 16-year-old in October 2020, completing a move from Spanish giants Atletico Madrid. He helped the youth team win the FA Youth Cup in 2021/22, before making the step up to the first team that same season. Garnacho made his Premier League debut against Chelsea in April 2022. He scored his first league goal for the club in just his fifth appearance, netting a late winner against Fulham in November 2022.",
      "Since then the now-19-year-old has been a regular in Erik ten Hag’s side. This season, Garnacho has scored five times in the Premier League, including a brace in the 3-0 win over West Ham. It was back in 2020 when United were on the lookout for a 16-year-old winger who could make an impact on the first team in the future - and Cox has revealed how Garnacho was identified as the right player.",
      "“Our recruitment team profiled all the wide players of that age across Europe, comparing the talents and trying to identify which talent would be the one who would be the best fit for us as a football club,” he told the Sun. “Alejandro would have been at the top of that list. Gerardo Guzman, our academy scout in Spain, put Alejandro forward as the best talent available in Spain.”",
      "The move took place during Covid, meaning that video calls were needed to convince the player to make the move. That brought its own challenges.",
      "“I had to do that from my spare bedroom via video call, using a translator,” Cox added. “My boys at the time would have been 14 and 10 and I remember vividly that they were arguing with each other while I was trying to sign Alejandro. I still tell my boys now, had that argument rumbled on much longer then we probably wouldn’t have Alejandro Garnacho at Manchester United!”",
      "Luckily, the argument in the background didn’t put Garnacho, or his parents, off moving to Manchester. The rest, they say, is history.",

      "\"I don’t think so but Lisandro was his decision and he was not comfortable to be back on the pitch but after he tried and stopped in the next attack.\"",
      "\"I think they enjoy to play together, adventure, they want to do it together. They want also to pass the ball to each other and that everyone can play to the qualities and score goals. It is brilliant they want to do it together and that is the key. Young players the future for Manchester United is quite bright with talent on board, you have to develop it. This club wants to achieve a lot, this club wants to win trophies so very ambitious so they have to step up and bring high levels. Also against the best opposition they have to express the same threat and it is about end product.\"",
      "\"We haven’t made the decision yet.\"",
      "\"I think it is very good how he developed his team and how they want to play, in and out of position. The players know what they have to do and cooperate with each other. They are a real team with weapons in their team, we have to play our maximum levels.\"",
      "\"I said to the team from the start of January every game is now a final. That was also our approach to West Ham, this is a final, we have to take this challenge and see it as a final. That will be every day now from on.\"",
      "\"We have options. How to deal with that position. We have good centre halves in our squad so the others are available, Luke can play also there. Quite confident we can keep the process going so others can fulfil the position and also contribute playing in high levels. Those players are experienced. That is an advantage that we have seen [left-footed player in that role]. We have to work on players. They can also develop in such positions when you work with them and coach with them and train them. I see our players in the back line developing their skills when building up.\"",
      "\"Players need time especially young players like Rasmus and Alejandro, they need time but also they need a team so those effects were not there in the first half of the season. We have to make a lot of adjustments in our way of playing so it was difficult to serve the offensive part of the team. When it happens it can go really quickly for players to progress. From the start I was confident they have the potential to do what they are doing and now it is about keeping going keep moving be hungry.\"",
      "\"So if that is his view then I would say it expresses the ambition of this club which is good but it is not my task in this club to deal with stadium questions, with facilities, my job is to manage the team and rebuild the squad\"",

That would prevent United from playing in front of reduced-capacity crowds.",
      "Spurs moved out of White Hart Lane in 2017 and resided at Wembley until their new stadium opened in March 2019 due to a string of delays.",

      "Man Utd are yet to win four games in a row this season and winning at Villa Park would be more significant than recent triumphs at the ground.",
      "Across 31 games that spanned 27 years, Manchester United's only defeat at Villa Park was in a 1999 League Cup tie that Sir Alex Ferguson treated so dismissively he selected a stronger side in his testimonial match two days earlier.",
      "Ferguson's contempt for the competition back then was spelt out in his team selection: Bosnich, Curtis, Higginbotham, O'Shea, Clegg, Twiss, Chadwick, Wallwork, Greening, Cruyff, Solskjaer. Bench: Culkin, Notman, Healy, Roche, Wellens.",
      "United won their last four FA Cup semi-finals at Villa Park before the soulless switch to Wembley semis in 2008. Arguably more euphoric was the five-minute turnaround in the third round against Villa in 2002, a night Ruud van Nistelrooy forged a lifelong bond with the United supporters who invaded the pitch.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: United could rebuild Old Trafford without moving stadium",
      "Villa Park is not the gimme it once was for United. Villa got the ultimate manager bounce when Unai Emery's appointment ended a 9,941-day wait for a home league win over United last season. Now Villa occupy the fourth spot that once decided the futures of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal as United manager.",
      "United have not recorded a win away from home against a top-eight side since Tottenham on October 30 2021 and that was Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last win in management. It was hardly a coup. Nuno Espirito Santo was summoned to the guillotine by Daniel Levy two days later.",
      "The highest-placed side United have beaten away from home this season is Wolves, a truly creditable result in incredible circumstances. There was a 90th-minute win at Fulham and United also prevailed at the bottom three.",
      "That is true to form. United won at the bottom six clubs last season. Wolves were in the relegation zone when they were seen off on New Year's Eve. Fulham were ninth.",
      "Already a pattern is emerging: beating the fodder and repeating victories. United's last two wins at Craven Cottage were via goals in added time. United have had 30 Premier League away days under Erik ten Hag, won 13, drawn four and lost 13.",
      "Their record last season was reasonably respectable. They finished fifth in the away table with more wins than Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea. Only Arsenal and Manchester City achieved more away triumphs.",
      "In November, Ten Hag dubiously described United's away record as \"very good\". United went and won clinically at Everton three days later but there was not another away league win until Molineux last week.",
      "At Everton, United were 1-0 up at the pause without creating a chance, such was the audacity of Alejandro Garnacho's overhead kick. Everton fans headed for the concourse scratching their head at the scoreline and their profligacy. A Marcus Rashford penalty and Anthony Martial's customary goal against Everton took the game away from them.",
      "Since then, there was the annual surrender at Newcastle, United defied just about everyone to avoid another tonking at Anfield and eke a point before insipid losses at West Ham and Nottingham Forest either side of Christmas.",
      "Last season, United lost at top-half teams City, Arsenal, Newcastle, Liverpool, Brighton, Villa and Brentford, sieving 26 goals. They are winless at Anfield since January 2016, last left the Emirates with three points in December 2017, have failed to beat Newcastle at St James' Park since their 2021 takeover and have never won at Brighton's Amex Stadium with a crowd present.",
      "The state of the nation is more positive, at least. United have seldom had such a serene week all season and the memorial service on the anniversary of the Munich air disaster on Tuesday was poignantly observed amid inclement weather.",
      "The news cycle is almost always quieter in victory and United won well twice last week. The defeat of West Ham marked only United's second three-game winning run all season. They head to Villa with the opportunity to lay down a marker and dispel any notion that their form since the January breather is not a false dawn.",
      "There is the added fascination that Villa have gone to pot at home. They were undefeated at Villa Park this season until Newcastle went 3-0 up last week. Then Chelsea did this week. Both won 3-1.",
      "Villa were firm favourites to eject Chelsea and wobbles like Wednesday night's test a team's nerve. Plenty will now doubt whether Villa have the nerve to cling onto fourth. Tottenham are on their coattails and United would move to within five points if they win on Sunday.",
      "Fifteen months ago, United took umbrage with referee Anthony Taylor when he moved their wall further back for Lucas Digne's free-kick. Christian Eriksen politely protested but was tersely ignored by Taylor and DIgne put Villa 2-0 up and on their way to a 3-1 victory.",
      "As Taylor was miked up, United were able to access the audio interaction between the official and Eriksen. contacted the Professional Game Match Officials Limited Select Group 1 Manager Jon Moss. Moss assured them Taylor would be spoken to.",
      "That was a three-goal defeat at Villa Ferguson would have been bothered by.",

      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is hardly an exhilarating name for a state-of-the-art, luxurious and mesmerising venue, but that hardly matters in the grand scheme of things. Having watched parts of White Hart Lane be ripped away with one corner completely vacant in the 2016/17 season to show a brief glimpse into the future of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, the process to get to the new stadium was far from easy.",
      "Under Mauricio Pochettino at the time, a tumultuous 18 months at Wembley followed after Spurs' final game in the place they called home for over a century, before playing their first competitive game against Crystal Palace on April 3, 2019 with goals from Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen making history.",

      "READ MORE:Manchester United news and transfers LIVE - Ivan Toney interest, Old Trafford plans, Brian Brobbey message",
      "I vividly remember watching that game on television and immediately being blown away by the sheer size of the south stand along with how impressive the rest of the stadium looked from the gantry. Later that year for a Premier League clash against Bournemouth, I visited the new ground for the first time with my seat in the lower tier of the north stand which placed me directly opposite the 17,500 seater south stand built to generate a 'wall of sound.'",
      "And that is how it certainly sounded when Dele Alli crashed home Spurs' third in a 3-2 victory under Jose Mourinho. From an experience perspective there is nothing quite like the atmosphere in N17, but it is perhaps off the pitch where a greater impact has been felt.",
      "Club chairman Daniel Levy has his fair share of critics, me included, but it is perhaps only now where his ability as a shrewd businessman can be appreciated. In a January transfer window where clubs were terrified of breaking profit and sustainability rules, Tottenham improved their squad in the short-term, with a loan deal for Timo Werner, the mid-term by signing Radu Dragusin as cover for Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven and the long-term by bringing in Swedish wonderkid Lucas Bergvall.",
      "The revenue made from the new stadium is also huge, despite the £1.2bn cost, and Spurs are currently reaping the benefits of this. The Tottenham Hotspur Skywalk is a hugely unique tourist attraction and the brand new FL Drive Go Kart track is also likely to bring in a significant amount of money.",
      "Not to mention the partnership with the NFL which has seen the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium become the home of American Football in the UK. The latest contract, signed until 2030, will see two regular-season games played per year with the matchday revenue earned likely to be huge given how popular the sport is among European fans and how difficult it can be to get tickets in the United States.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, as a billionaire, is clearly a smart businessman and doing everything he can to agree these types of deals associated with Manchester United will be a huge benefit financially to justify moving from Old Trafford. While many supporters, myself included, prior to the appointment of Ange Postecoglou, felt disillusioned with the football club and the decisions being made that is no longer the case.",
      "One big call proving to be the best one has allowed numerous others to come to the forefront and be proven as such as well. The relatively comfortable financial position Spurs find themselves in is largely because of the new stadium, along with the summer sale of Harry Kane.",
      "Ratcliffe wanting Man United's home to be the 'Wembley of the North' is certainly achievable and while moving away from their home of the last 114 years will not be seen as even an option by some, perhaps it is exactly what the club need.",
      "The last decade on the pitch, since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson, has been a disappointment and living in the past and constantly drawing onto it doesn't appear to help things. A stadium move in line with a new ownership era could be exactly what is needed to reap benefits on the pitch, and as has been made clear by Tottenham, the long-term financial gain has the potential to be valuable.",

      "Erik ten Hag believes Sir Jim Ratcliffe's prospective plans for a new Old Trafford highlight the ambition of the Manchester United investor.",
      "United are exploring the possibility of revamping or rebuilding Old Trafford, which has not expanded on its capacity since the north-west and north-east quadrants were installed in 2006. The club could rebuild Old Trafford on the same site without moving stadium, with some staff vehemently against the prospect of seeking temporary residence at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium.",
      "The Ineos Group that Ratcliffe is chairman of are still awaiting regulatory approval from the Premier League for their 25% stakeholding in United but Ratcliffe has made three separate visits to Manchester to hold key meetings and outline plans for United going forward.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: United could rebuild Old Trafford without moving stadium",
      "\"If that's his view, I would say it expresses the ambition of this club, which is good,\" Ten Hag said. \"But further on, it's not my task in this club to deal with stadium questions, facilities. My job is to perform the team, manage the team and improve the squad.\"",

      "\"I think they enjoy to play together, there is adventure, they are a danger, they want to do it together,\" Ten Hag enthused. \"They want also to pass the ball to each other and that everyone can play to the qualities and everyone can score goals.",

      "The MEN has allowed Manchester United supporters to have their say on the January transfer window and what plans should look like for the summer.",
      "A large percentage of Manchester United supporters do not believe manager Erik ten Hag has been given the tools he needs to achieve the club's ambitions in the second half of this season.",
      "Out of Europe and the Carabao Cup, United's only realistic hope of winning a trophy this season is in the form of the FA Cup. United discovered on Wednesday night they will face Nottingham Forest at the City Ground in the fifth round later this month.",
      "After finishing as runners-up in the competition last term, United will be hoping to go one better this time around. Meanwhile, they have also strengthened their outside chances of securing Champions League qualification for next season after back-to-back Premier League wins.",
      "Though neither challenge is impossible, 58 per cent of United supporters who participated in a recent MEN Sport survey do not believe Ten Hag has been given a good enough squad to achieve United's goals. A total of 1,353 people participated in the survey and more than half of them do not believe Ten Hag has the quality he needs.",
      "As a result of that, only 21 per cent of voters believe United will achieve a top-four finish this season. The majority of those who participated in the survey believe the club will finish sixth in the Premier League, with that option earning 33 per cent of the votes.",
      "United failed to add to their squad in the January transfer window, despite Ten Hag being keen to bring in a new striker. The Dutchman cited Financial Fair Play [FFP] limits as the reason for United's failure to recruit a new goal-getter.",
      "Of the 1,300-plus people that took part in the survey, 52 per cent of them were 'unhappy' with the club's transfer business last month. Of the voters, 38 per cent of them were 'satisfied' and 10 per cent were 'delighted'.",
      "As for the current landscape of the squad, it is the goalkeeping department that United's fans have the most concerns about, with 41 per cent of voters choosing that area of the team as the most concerning. United's forward options ranked second, securing 23 per cent of the votes.",
      "Looking ahead to the summer transfer window and next season, United do plan to strengthen Ten Hag's squad, with a handful of positions having been earmarked to bolster. From the survey responses submitted, 62 per cent were in favour of United drafting in 'three or four' new faces ahead of 2024/25, with 20 per cent selecting 'five or six'. Not a single voter suggested United do not need to recruit anyone in the summer.",
      "As for which position United need to strengthen the most ahead of next season, there was not much to separate the attack from the goalkeeping and centre-back departments. A total of 28 per cent of the responses cited recruiting a new forward as the main objective, with both the goalkeeping and centre-back areas each commanding 24 per cent of the votes.",
      "Just four per cent of the votes recorded suggested signing a new full-back should be the Reds' main aim. The prospect of signing a new central midfielder as a priority scooped 14 per cent of the votes.",

      "Man United are set to try and sign a striker in the summer transfer window, but that is an easier said than done challenge.",
      "Few strikers, if any, are in a richer vein of form in the Premier League right now than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The 21-year-old, who swapped Atalanta for Manchester United last summer, plundered his fourth goal in as many Premier League matches in Sunday's 3-0 win over West Ham United at Old Trafford. The Dane's opener against the Hammers also marked his fifth goal in his last six appearances in all competitions.",
      "Now into double figures for the campaign, he is gradually beginning to prove why United decided to invest an initial £64million in his signature to become the long-term face their forward line. Outside of his goals, his overall performances have also been much-improved, with his link-up play coming on leaps and bounds.",
      "His lay-off for Marcus Rashford's opener against Wolves at Molineux last Thursday night was a direct result of his awareness and composure. It was a clever lay-off and the finish from Rashford was even better.",
      "Hojlund netted United's second goal at Molineux, turning the ball home from close-range after good work by Luke Shaw on the left. That highlighted his determination and aggression to get himself into a position to stand any chance of scoring.",
      "His goal against West Ham was much more polished. After pouncing on the weight of Casemiro's interception, the Dane skipped a couple of West Ham challenges and fired an emphatic effort out of Alphonse Areola's reach. It was his best goal in United colours thus far, with the quality of the finish demonstrating that his confidence levels are increasing.",
      "As a result of his confidence levels being on an upward curve, United's supporters are now starting to understand why the club selected him as their first-choice option when there hopes of landing Harry Kane last summer failed to get off the ground. Though he is still raw and learning on the job, it is starting to become clear that he has enormous potential.",
      "Having committed to a transfer fee that could eventually rise to £72m, United signed Hojlund with the plan for him to be the face of their forward line for years to come. It is not unrealistic, should he continue to make progress, to suggest he could carry the responsibility of United's chief goal-getter for the next decade.",
      "Prior to his recent hot-streak, it had been argued United needed to sign another striker to provide stern competition for him in the starting line-up. Manager Erik ten Hag, following another injury to Anthony Martial, admitted last week that he wanted to add another striker to his ranks in the January transfer window.",
      "Martial is out-of-contract in the summer and is widely expected to leave the club, leaving Hojlund as United's only out-and-out senior striker. Recruiting a forward is understood to be one of the club's priorities ahead of 2024/25.",
      "Whereas only a few weeks ago you may have argued United needed to bring in a striker to challenge Hojlund for a starting berth, you would now be inclined to think that won't be necessary. The Reds will, of course, need to bring in a replacement for Martial to provide competition and support for Hojlund, but it is unlikely the club will target a direct competitor to rival him for a starting berth.",
      "With that said, United's ambition of bringing in a striker ahead of next season may not be a straightforward task. Whereas they were able to promise Hojlund the guarantee of a starting berth every week when trying to convince him to join the club last summer, they will be unable to offer that promise to the striker they attempt to sign this forthcoming summer.",
      "It means United will not be able to attract some of the names they have been linked with in recent months, such as Ivan Toney; he would not swap a starting berth at Brentford for a place on the bench at Old Trafford. Furthermore, United would be foolish to part with the fee Toney would command for him to be a back-up option.",
      "It means United could struggle when trying to attract a suitable option to provide competition for Hojlund. Their sales pitch will have to outline that the role is to be a back-up or rotational option, opposed to a regular starter.",
      "Offering such a role means United could be limited to what they can do when trying to find Hojlund some competition. It is likely they will be forced down the road of recruiting a youngster with high potential, but not yet worthy of regular starts at a club of United's stature.",

He has been sidelined since November 11 with a calf problem and last started a Premier League game on October 7. It's not exactly the return Erik ten Hag hoped for when he identified him as his top midfield target a year ago.",
      "Mount joined United from Chelsea for £60million in the last summer window and has been 'struggling' with injury issues since August. It begs the question of how much United knew of the extent of his injury issues before he joined.",
      "The England international did not start in any of Chelsea's last 18 matches of the 2022–23 campaign due to a pubis injury, and he has started nine games in the last year, completing 90 minutes only once. It would be a surprise if he played a full game before the end of the campaign.",
      "That's not because of further fitness concerns, but because of the fact he won't be starting matches in the first place. What is so alarming is that even when he is fit, it is hard to see exactly where he fits into the United side, a problem that has worsened during his spell on the sidelines.",
      "Mount was signed to be the link man in midfield, tasked with progressing the play from defence to attack and bringing composure to the role. Kobbie Mainoo has proven to be that man instead.",
      "In the five matches that Mount and Casemiro played together at the start of the campaign, United struggled for a midfield presence, with the duo struggling to match the physicality of the Premier League.",
      "Mount's case is again not helped by the fact teenager Mainoo has shone with his physicality as well as his ball-playing ability, showcasing both silk and steel during his senior breakthrough.",
      "The former Chelsea midfielder is now a backup at best for United, behind Mainoo in the progressive midfield role and still behind club captain Bruno Fernandes in the more advanced attacking midfield role too.",
      "It is not necessarily the biggest blow to have a player like Mount on the bench, though it once again undermines Ten Hag's own eye for talent and the huge amount of money invested in a squad player, which left them short of funds to strengthen the squad in the January window.",
      "Mount is also not helped by the fact United look to have finally solved their right-wing dilemma. Up until late December, there was no outstanding candidate to occupy the right-flank role, a position that he had shone in during his time at Chelsea.",
      "The 25-year-old looked like an ideal big-game player thanks to his energy, pressing ability, and defensive discipline, but Ten Hag will favour the attacking threat of Alejandro Garnacho in that position instead.",
      "There could still be occasions in which United decide Mount is worthy of a position switch out wide to help them against some strong possession-based opponents, though there are few opportunities for that to be tested between now and the end of the season.",
      "As he nears a return to injury, Mount will be desperate to make up for lost time. The bad news for him is that others made the most of it instead.",

      "When the deal handing Ineos 25% of Manchester United was confirmed on Christmas Eve their to-do list was both long and unappealing. The beginning of the end for the Glazers was toasted by supporters over the festive period, but the situation remained grim.",
      "Defeat to Nottingham Forest in the final game of 2023 made it five defeats in December for Erik ten Hag’s side and while Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford were busy getting to work behind the scenes, what was unfolding in front of them on the pitch would have been causing more immediate concern.",
      "Ratcliffe is still waiting for regulatory approval for his minority investment to go through but his fingerprints are all over every major decision United have made in the last six-and-a-half weeks, most of them focused on bringing long-term success back to Old Trafford.",
      "But while Brailsford’s review of football operations at the club and Ratcliffe’s attempts to put the football front and centre once again were worthy attempts at bringing some kind of order back to the club, their task was only going to be made more difficult by getting the reins in a season that was threatening to become an unmitigated disaster.",
      "On Christmas Eve they inherited a manager under pressure, a £72million striker who couldn’t score and a team that lost as often as they won. They were out of Europe already and threatening to not even qualify for continental competition in 2024/25.",
      "With their compliance with the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) already tight, such a scenario was daunting. It would have a significant affect on this summer’s budget at a time when United need to spend to get back in the top four.",
      "But as the day the keys are officially cut for Ineos gets closer, the situation is looking up. Perhaps the two short-term scenarios they least wanted to countenance are no longer looking quite so problematic.",
      "Ratcliffe and Brailsford’s initial discussions with Ten Hag were positive and results are improving, as the Dutchman suggested they would when the injury situation eased. He isn’t out of the woods yet, the collapse at Wolves before Kobbie Mainoo’s intervention was concerning and although the win at West Ham was an example of the clinical finishing they’ve been missing, they still allowed the visitors to have 22 shots at Old Trafford.",
      "But four wins in five games have eased the pressure on Ten Hag and suggested he might just be the man to oversee the Ineos era on the pitch. The last thing Ratcliffe wanted was to have to consider a change in manager while looking for a new sporting director. He desperately wants - and needs - Ten Hag to steady the ship and reassert his own credentials.",
      "With no prospect of managerial change to consider, the planning for the summer transfer window becomes easier - especially with a new sporting director appointed in plenty of time. United do need to get away from allowing Ten Hag the level of control he has over recruitment decisions, with too many of his signings not working out.",
      "But one that is certainly paying off is the decision to back Hojlund this summer. The signing of an inexperienced 20-year-old striker to lead the line at United was a gamble but that roll of the dice is certainly looking better.",
      "United still need another striker this summer, but Hojlund has now scored in four successive Premier League appearances and is up to 10 goals for the season. He is beginning to look like the frontman Ten Hag and football director John Murtough thought he could be.",
      "If the Dane can maintain that form until the end of the season, then the focus this summer will be on signing competition for him, rather than needing to consider another elite striker to score the goals required at United. Hojlund suddenly looks like he might be that man and that change in status could save the club millions this summer.",
      "With no decision to be made over a new manager and no need to break the bank on a first-choice striker, the in-tray for Ineos could be looking better. It will allow Ratcliffe to focus on infrastructure developments at Old Trafford and Carrington and on getting the right personnel in the right positions. The weeks between confirmation of the deal and approval from the Premier League have gone as well as could have been hoped for.",

      "As Sir Jim Ratcliffe looks at ways to raise funds to redevelop Old Trafford, Man United's supporters' trust has its own plan.",
      "Manchester United would be able to partly fund the redevelopment of Old Trafford by selling shares to fans that would give them a say in how the club is run.",
      "That's according to the club's supporters' trust, who want to help realise Sir Jim Rafcliffe's vision of building the 'Wembley of the North' in return for a minority supporter stake in the club. The billionaire businessman is considering lobbying the government to help raise public money that could be used to fund a rebuilt Old Trafford as United's new investor gets the grips with the task of building a club that is first in class both on and off the pitch.",
      "The Manchester United Supporters’ Trust (MUST) is supportive of Ratcliffe's vision in the main, with the group's chief executive Duncan Drasdo holding the view that any request to use public money would need to be “justified in terms of regional economic development and community benefit”.",
      "But what MUST would really like to see is United making use of its global fanbase by creating a supporters' share option that would also ensure that the fan-base could have a say in how their club is run.",
      "Speaking to the Telegraph, Drasdo said: “Lobbying for public money is certainly an interesting idea and speaks to the potential for the stadium development to be a local and regional catalyst for economic development and community benefit. However, you’d expect opposition to public money being used for essentially a private asset, even with regional economic and community benefits.",
      "“An ownership stake for the community could help and there is potential for a source of funding from fans and the community, co-investing, and having a real stake. The latter is something we’d clearly be strong advocates for if there was such an opportunity.",
      "“Clearly with the huge global fanbase it is conceivable that fans could contribute a significant sum collectively but perhaps of greater value than the cash sum is the concept of fans and the community working in partnership with the club and other investors all aligned towards a shared goal and owning a real stake in our club and our stadium.",
      "“Any public element would need to be justified in terms of regional economic development and community benefit and I can certainly see that a major role for the community in terms of the fans who support the club having an ownership stake could only enhance the case.”",
      "Ratcliffe's 28.9 per cent stake in the club, which is expected to be approved by regulators in the next couple of weeks, included a pledge to invest £237 million in an Old Trafford stadium that is no longer fit for a club of United's standing. According to the Telegraph, building a new stadium for United from scratch is estimated to cost somewhere between £1.5 billion and £2 billion to bring to fruition, while developing the existing stadium and expanding the south stand would be expected to cost around £800 million.",
      "Ratcliffe's company Ineos are no strangers to raising huge amounts of capital through finance deals, but the supporters' trust, who have witnessed huge sums of money being leveraged against their club during the Glazers' ownership tenure, remain in favour of an 'equity over debt' approach wherever it is possible.",
      "United issued a survey to supporters in July as the club canvassed its fan base over plans to redevelop Old Trafford. This has been seen as a positive step in the right direction but Drasdo is insisting that supporters must continue to be consulted at every step of the process in order to ensure that the end result is in the club's and fans' best interests.",
      "He told the Telegraph: “As football fans it’s natural that the initial reaction is an emotional one and evokes very strong feelings connected with the history of the club. There needs to be a rational debate about what is best for the football club and supporters and not just the best economic outcome for shareholders. The noises we’re hearing from Ineos suggest they are sympathetic to that view.",
      "“If you suggest Old Trafford is going to be knocked down clearly you’ll generate an immediate emotional and protective response from any supporter. I think most fans are torn on this and it is essentially a heart versus head issue but we really need to see details of the two options side by side to make a comparison and allow fans to take an informed view.”",

      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",
      "On the same day, Jack stood on the Old Trafford pitch and brandished his own shirt. That was one way to tell which is which.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "However dear the stadium is to time-served Manchester United supporters, the notion the club would lose its heritage by bulldozing a 114-year-old stadium is misguided. United should remain on the same footprint but in a new Old Trafford.",
      "Joel Glazer, someone who has not been in Manchester for almost five years, favours redeveloping the stadium. The United co-chairman has likened going to Old Trafford to visiting the storied Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox since 1912.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: United could rebuild Old Trafford without moving stadium",
      "Since Glazer last occupied a seat in the directors' box, a waterfall has gushed down from the Stretford End roof, staff have had to plug the gaps in the roof of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand and sewage has overflown in the toilets.",
      "United have the space to rebuild Old Trafford whilst playing in their current home. There would be no reduced capacities, no loss in matchday revenue, pending their progress in competitions, and no need to query the tenancy rate at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "There is adjacent land United could purchase and there are car parks behind the Stretford End that stretch the length of at least two, maybe three, football pitches.",
      "The Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the only single-tier stand in the stadium due to the issue of the railway line behind it. That could be bypassed with a new build and 'rotating' the stadium has been proposed.",

      "\"No f*****g chance,\" was the reply from a senior United employee when asked if United would ever temporarily relocate to Ashton New Road. Maine Road was United's home between 1946-49 and their first ever European tie - a 10-0 thrashing of Anderlecht - was held at City's ground in 1956.",

The former director of communications Charlie Brooks ordered a drastic makeover of the shabby media facilities in 2019, the players' lounge was restored at Erik ten Hag's behest for the start of this season and the directors' lounge has also had an upgrade, as have hospitality suites.

      "The headlines write themselves: an unexpected Korea change; a player in need of some Seoul searching; or how everything went South for Jesse Lingard.",
      "The truth is that his transfer should serve as a timely reminder to Manchester United of the importance of knowing when to cash in on a player at the right time.",
      "It has been over three years since he was the headline exit from United in the January transfer window, when he embarked on a loan move to West Ham United, which reinvigorated his career and rebuilt his confidence. Lingard netted nine goals and assisted five goals in just 16 appearances for the club, winning both the Premier League Player and Goal of the Month awards in the process.",
      "He returned to United rejuvenated and, most importantly, worth as much as he ever had been during his time at the club. The squad player was now a star, and they were not short of interest in his signature.",
      "Yet, despite serious interest from a number of clubs, he was assured of a major role to play under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and was persuaded to stay and to fight for his place. It was a hasty change of mind from both parties following his success at West Ham, and one that didn’t pay off.",
      "United resembled a toddler who has no need for a toy until someone else shows an interest in it. Lingard had no role to play and was free to leave, until it turned out he was actually quite good and they wanted to selfishly keep him for themselves.",
      "Lingard ended up only starting two Premier League matches during his final season at the club, was denied a January exit to West Ham or Newcastle, and was upset when Ralf Rangnick denied him a final farewell appearance against Brentford in May 2022.",
      "A year after they could have sold a squad player when their value was at its peak, they ended up losing him for free instead.",
      "Lingard might still wonder what would have happened had he joined West Ham or Newcastle rather than Nottingham Forest, but he will hope to have no regrets about his move to FC Seoul. This is a transfer about enjoying his football again and getting to experience an entirely new lifestyle and career that have stagnated in the last three years.",
      "It should also serve as another timely reminder to United of the ruthless nature of the sport and why it is often wise to cash in on a squad player while they still retain value rather than keep hold of them out of greed.",
      "That is a transfer policy that looks to have changed under Erik ten Hag, at least. United have aimed to become \"smarter\" in terms of selling academy graduates, with staff suspecting players are going \"stale and sour\" if they stay at the club too long without getting an opportunity to play.",
      "Dean Henderson, Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado were all academy graduates who were allowed to leave last summer.",
      "Yet, it still isn't perfect. Anthony Martial will leave for free this summer, when he could previously have been sold, and they will have a job on their hands trying to shift Donny van de Beek as well.",
      "Lingard's switch to South Korea is another reminder of what might have been and, at the same time, a warning of what could happen again.",
      "United's transfer strategy is 'smarter', but it still isn't the smartest.",

      "A whole-scale rebuild is set to be costly, but many feel as though the club would get more value out of the pound from that rather than an expansion, which would likely cause logistical nightmares and leave the club with a lower enhanced capacity.",
      "Jon Leach, the sports sector lead for infrastructure consultation company Aecom, believes a rebuild on the same site would cost at least £500m, which is considered to be less than what a total relocation would require.",
      "Any type of move would be time-consuming and Leach - who worked on schemes for the 2016 Rio Olympics - says the most realistic completion time period would be up to three years. Speaking to Building.co.uk in 2022, he explained how a top-of-the-range stadium would cost around half-a-billion pounds.",
      "“I’d say 30 months would be better [than a two-year timeframe]. Three years, you should be able to do it [a new-build] in that,” he added.",
      "Leach suggested that a stadium rebuild would likely impact on-field elements such as transfers and player wages. He questioned: “If you need to invest in new players, can you afford to invest in a new stadium?”",
      "United may wish to look at the projects that saw Arsenal and Tottenham construct new home grounds, as well as Wembley Stadium, which was opened in 2007. Clare Gallagher was a senior engineer on the building of The Emirates Stadium, which was completed in 2006.",
      "“Getting the brief right in the first place is absolutely key,” she said. “If you change it during construction, it presents more challenges. It puts pressure on the budgets and times.",
      "“To get the budget right, you have to get the brief right. FM [facility management] is absolutely key as well. Stadium security and safety have to be built in, so you have to get the end user involved in the process from the start.”",
      "Speaking on what made Arsenal’s move so successful, Gallagher added: “The client knew what it wanted and communicated that. The brief was very clear from very early doors. We were all very much one team. All decisions were made in the interest of the project.”",
      "For example: “[Arsene Wenger] asked for a column in the changing room to be moved. He wanted to be able to walk in and have eye-to-eye contact with everyone. So, the column got removed.”",
      "Another unnamed contractor said United ought to take time to get the blueprint correct but to not be alarmed if plans have to be altered: “Stadiums go wrong because they are unique designs and, typically, the design isn’t completed at the start. My advice to Manchester United would be this: design it right at the start, don’t rush it and take your time.”",

      "Ineos are considering the plans laid out for the redevelopment of Old Trafford but the next decision made has to last the test of time.",
      "When Manchester United visited Goodison Park in November it wasn't hard to pick up the whiff of a club in crisis. Railing against the corrupt Premier League, dreading what their 10-point deduction for breaching financial rules might do to their season and fearing another charge coming further down the line.",
      "Everton are treading a delicately fine line at the moment. Financially they remain in a tight spot and after Luton's resurgence, they are in the relegation zone and facing another possible points deduction for breaching the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules.",
      "But travel a couple of miles south-west of Goodison and the future of Everton is reaching up into the skyline next to the Mersey. A club constrained by a stadium full of romance but short on modernity is looking to Bramley Moor dock and their new £550million home to transform them into a top-half club once again.",
      "To achieve that, Everton need to ride out the storm and that means Premier League survival, but when this stadium opens - probably sometime in 2025 - it will be one of their best in England. It will certainly be one of the best in the north west.",
      "At that point, United should have decided on how to proceed with their own home. Old Trafford might not be comparable to Goodison Park in terms of a lack of space and a lack of facilities, but a ground that set the standard in this country 20 years ago has been overtaken. It isn't the best stadium in England any more, it isn't the best stadium in the north west, in fact it isn't even the best stadium in Manchester.",
      "That honour goes to the Etihad, soon to be increased in capacity with a new hotel built on-site and improvements made to the City Square fan zone. It will put the ground in contention to host a Champions League final in the future.",
      "City benefitted from inheriting the City of Manchester Stadium after Manchester hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2002, but they have remained on top of stadium development and it is a spectacular home for a stunning football team. At Everton, redeveloping Goodison has never been possible due to its location and they have had some torturous and controversial projects come and go before settling on a city centre location that will make it a must-visit venue.",
      "They will no longer be split by Stanley Park from Liverpool's Anfield home. That is an example of a club that has found a way to redevelop its existing stadium. Under the ownership of Fenway Sports Group, they have rebuilt the Main Stand and increased the size of the second tier on the Anfield Road End. It has increased capacity by around 15,000 and, perhaps as importantly, significantly improved the corporate offering.",
      "There is an argument to make that, once Bramley Moor opens, United will have the third or fourth-best stadium in the north west. Old Trafford is rich in history and vast in size, but the roof leaks, the facilities aren't up to standard and the offering around the stadium is poor. United still make more than their Premier League rivals on matchday, but the potential isn't being maximised.",
      "With regulatory approval for Ineos' 25% stake in the club nearing approval, movement on plans for Old Trafford is expected. The options on the table are relatively simple. It would take around £800m to redevelop the current ground, which primarily involves work on the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, which is the only single-tier stand at the stadium and has seen better days.",
      "The issue with that is building over the railway line and it presents complex challenges. The more expensive option, which may push costs towards the £2bn mark, is to build a new ground on the vast footprint of the Old Trafford site. United could continue to play in their own ground while work on the new stadium takes place, which is likely to be behind the current Stretford End.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe put £245m into the club for infrastructure improvements when his minority ownership was confirmed on Christmas Eve, but with work also on the agenda at Carrington, that figure is a drop in the ocean compared to what is actually required. Funding work on a new stadium would be difficult, especially given the unusual ownership structure at United, which now sees Ratcliffe calling the shots but the Glazers still owning most of the club.",
      "But United must find a way to make it work and building a new stadium must surely be the preferred option. While this is a club that once set the standards, that is no longer the case. Old Trafford might remain the biggest stadium in the Premier League, but it isn't the best.",
      "Arsenal's 2006 move to the Emirates Stadium began the charge of clubs moving into glorious new homes. Tottenham's new ground - built adjacent to White Hart Lane - is now the gold standard in the Premier League.",
      "That is the standard United must aspire to. Improving the existing Old Trafford might be the choice of romantics, but the long-term question should be whether that work will stand the test of time. If the answer is no, then a new stadium is the obvious choice.",
      "It could take years to come to fruition, but then this is a long-term project. Whatever United do should be aimed at once again giving the biggest and the best stadium in the Premier League.",

      "Christian Eriksen is out of contract in the summer of 2025 but a departure at the end of the season looks likely.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen was considered undroppable for the first half of last season, which meant his signing on a free transfer represented excellent value.",
      "There was a relationship developed between Casemiro, Eriksen and Bruno Fernandes and that settled trio became key after a worrying start to the campaign for Erik ten Hag. Casemiro made his first start for United against Everton in October 2022, playing alongside Eriksen and Fernandes, and those three were used in 10 of the next 12 league games.",
      "It was only disrupted by Eriksen being absent for a game due to illness and Fernandes picking up a suspension. United drew against Newcastle and lost against Aston Villa in those two matches and many felt the enforced midfield changes were to blame for the performances.",
      "Eriksen helped control the centre of the pitch when he started and his absence was obvious when he didn't feature, making him one of the first names on the team sheet. However, he sustained an ankle injury against Reading in the FA Cup last January after a tackle from Andy Carroll.",
      "“I'm disappointed about that,\" Ten Hag said about the challenge. \"I think football has to set limits, restrictions, that protect the players. What football wants is the best players to be available on the pitch.",
      "“This is a tackle - and the two tackles after it – that don’t belong on a pitch, because there is a high risk of injuring your colleague. So it's worse and I'm left wondering about that.",
      "“I'm also wondering more, when we were at Crystal Palace, when there was an elbow on Lisandro Martinez. I don't believe there was even a whistle for a free-kick and I'm wondering about such things, because it's a risk of injury for the player.\"",
      "Eriksen returned from the sidelines in April but the 31-year-old looked weary and short of legs. He started 13 league games from January until the end of the campaign and played a full game just once. It was obvious his involvement had been carefully managed.",
      "The player's physical limitations were exposed in a handful of matches and Mason Mount was signed from Chelsea to become his successor. The 25-year-old promised to lead the midfield press while providing verge and energy, but his time at the club so far hasn't worked out.",
      "Mount has encountered different injury problems since signing for United and he did not look suited to a deeper midfield role at the beginning of the season. Many have wondered why Mount was signed when Kobbie Mainoo was expected to break into the first-team.",
      "Before pre-season, Mainoo was informed he would be kept around the senior squad and his outstanding performances in recent weeks have been no surprise. Casemiro, Mainoo and Fernandes already looks like the strongest midfield-three available and Eriksen has consequently not been involved in the last three matches.",
      "Mount is closing in on a return to injury and could push Eriksen further down the midfield pecking order, which suggests it's likely he will leave at the end of the season. The Denmark international will celebrate his 32nd birthday next week and there are reports of interest from Galatasaray, who are said to be preparing to sign him from United.",
      "Eriksen is out of contract in 2025 and United have an opportunity this summer to bank a fee for a player they signed on a free transfer. He has been important for United but his importance has clearly waned.",

But instead a run of games arguably as gruelling as they have faced this season has instead given Erik ten Hag's side a pulse when it comes to salvaging their Premier League campaign.",
      "Four of their last five league games have been against top-half sides, with three of them against teams ahead of them at the time, but United lost just one - and that was against the only side they faced in the bottom half of the table. The wins against Aston Villa, Wolves and West Ham and the draw against Tottenham have made for a positive few weeks.",
      "The defeat at the City Ground is the only loss in the last seven games and although there are still flaws to iron out, Ten Hag can suddenly look ahead with some positivity. His side are into the FA Cup fifth round and back up to sixth in the Premier League.",
      "For most of this season returning to the Champions League has looked almost impossible, but after that string of encouraging league results it no longer feels quite as unlikely. United are eight points behind Aston Villa in fourth and six behind Tottenham in fifth and that could yet be enough this season if English clubs achieve enough success in Europe to end the year in the top two in the UEFA coefficients table.",
      "How United could desperately do with that bonus, even if it means hoping Manchester City and Liverpool progress in the Champions League and the Europa League once European action resumes this month. The early exit from continental competition of both Manchester United and Newcastle United has damaged the chances of securing enough points to guarantee that bonus spot, but there are enough teams left in Europe to make an impact and Arsenal, West Ham, Brighton and Aston Villa can all play their part.",
      "It's a convoluted system that United will now be paying closer attention to. If the Champions League looked a long way away at the end of 2023, it is suddenly back on the agenda. At a time when the Premier League's financial rules are causing ongoing headaches at Old Trafford, securing the revenues that Champions League football brings is absolutely vital, not to mention the prestige and the glamourous ties.",
      "But before United look too closely to Anfield and the Etihad for favours, they can get their own season firmly back on track this weekend. A second Premier League win against Aston Villa in the space of seven weeks will propel them back into the discussion for a top-four finish.",
      "That Boxing Day success over Villa saw Rasmus Hojlund get his first Premier League goal and he has scored in his three subsequent starts in the competition. United are suddenly firing in front of goal and that is making a big difference.",
      "Conversely, Villa have won just two of their last six Premier League games, against Burnley and Sheffield United. With their own European commitments set to resume next month they might find it gets harder to last the pace. If United can maintain their form and put Unai Emery's side under pressure then they might yet be able to reel them in.",
      "They will certainly find that easier if they can win at Villa Park on Sunday. Sheffield United's draw there before Christmas and Newcastle's win last week has made it less of a fortress than it appeared to be and Ten Hag's side have already had great joy exploiting their high-line recently. Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford will fancy their chances of doing so again.",
      "If they can close that gap to five points then it will throw the race for Champions League qualification wide open and United will be in the mix. That isn't a scenario that looked likely a couple of months ago.",
      "They might still need a favour from some of their rivals in Europe, but that might be worth it if it gets United back into the Champions League and the financial advantages that come with it.",

      "Former Man United captain Roy Keane has suggested that Lee Sharpe could have achieved more during his career but admitted that the winger was a 'good guy'",
      "Roy Keane believes former Manchester United teammate Lee Sharpe could have achieved more with his career.",
      "Keane and Sharpe played together at Manchester United from 1993 until 1996. One of their most memorable moments came when Sharpe scored a fantastic goal against Barcelona in the 1994/95 Champions League, backheeling a cross from Keane into the net.",
      "By age 19, Sharpe had already received his first England call-up and established himself as United's first-choice winger. However, his position on the left side was contested by Ryan Giggs following injury and illness. Sharpe also found his opportunities limited due to Dennis Irwin and David Beckham's performances, while manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly scrutinised the midfielder's play.",
      "After leaving United for Leeds in a £4.5million transfer, Sharpe's career continued to be disrupted by injury. Loan spells at Sampdoria and Bradford followed before Sharpe made a permanent move to the Bantams. He then saw out his career with stints at Everton, Grindavik and Garforth Town.",
      "Despite his successful career, Keane insinuated that Sharpe could have accomplished even more if he'd shown more motivation. Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, the former Sunderland and Ipswich boss said: \"Lee Sharpe was quite laid back, but he was a good guy.",
      "\"Maybe he would be the first to admit that he had little success in his career but could have done more if he tried harder. I think he would be honest enough to say that because he was so laid back and had the manager on his case all the time.",
      "\"But then he went up to Leeds and got a bad injury, but I think overall, I think Sharpie would admit that he could have done more in his career, but he didn't have that real hunger and desire to maintain a high standard over a long period of time.\"",
      "Keane suggested that Sharpe did not respond well to Ferguson's 'tough love' towards the end of his time in Manchester. He suggested that his former teammate noted he had stopped listening.",
      "The 52-year-old pundit explained: \"With managers giving players tough love, I remember seeing an interview recently with Lee Sharpe, and he really loved his football and off the field he had fun as well, especially with his dancing, but he said towards the end of his time at Manchester United, when Sir Alex Ferguson was having a go at him, he said that he just stopped listening.\"",

      "INEOS are 'getting down to business' at United as they begin the task of bringing the club back to elite status in both England and Europe. With plenty needing to be prioritised, the future of Old Trafford is currently at the forefront of the discussion.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at the latest stories surrounding United and given our take.",
      "The Theatre of Dreams requires a makeover after being neglected for too long. Earlier this week, reports surfaced suggesting Ratcliffe was in favour of building a new stadium in the vicinity of Old Trafford rather than developing the existing ground.",
      "INEOS' founder believes fans will be receptive to the idea of a new stadium which does not depart from its current location dramatically. However, the Glazers believe that Old Trafford should simply be renovated rather than being demolished and replaced.",
      "Ironically after years of opposition, the majority of supporters are likely to agree with the American family on this one point.",
      "MEN Sport says: Ratcliffe finds himself in a catch-22 scenario here as he looks to bring United into the 21st century. On the one hand, his intentions are admirable and the construction of a brand new stadium would perhaps make more financial sense.",
      "However, Old Trafford remains one of the most iconic venues in sport even in its current unloved state. Demolishing it would see a part of United die.",
      "At a time when some of the world's best stadiums are closing their doors for good, it would be nice if the Reds could buck the trend. If he is not careful, Ratcliffe could have a civil war on his hands over how to get this job done.",
      "Reports on Wednesday suggested United captain Bruno Fernandes could be denied a stacked new contract by INEOS when they arrive. The 29-year-old will have another two years remaining on his current deal in the summer but it is believed he wants to extend his stay.",
      "However, Ratcliffe and co are thought to be unwilling to offer an ageing player a lucrative contract which could open the door for Fernandes' exit in the next year or so.",
      "MEN Sport says: On his day, Fernandes has proven his worth to the club. His actions on the pitch may split opinion but his creativity is something which United lack.",
      "As captain, he is showing signs of maturity too and has become undroppable under Ten Hag. However, signing players onto long-term lucrative deals when they are past 30 has been the Reds' undoing for the past decade.",
      "INEOS are right to be wary of agreeing to huge proposals when he will be 31 come the end of his current contract. United need to learn to budget wiser and Ratcliffe's hand on the pursestrings could bring that about.",
      "Hopefully, an agreement can be reached as it would be a shame to lose Fernandes from this squad in 2026.",

      "But regardless of what happens, there is still reason to be cheerful. Onana's worst performances were in the Champions League, and on the whole, he has been pretty decent in the Premier League, despite the odd blips.",
      "Take that recent win against West Ham, for example. It would look like a convincing home win in the end, but it could have been a very different story if not for a sharp reaction stop to keep out Tomáš Souček's deflected header in the first half.",

      "It is easy to join the Onana pile-on given his calamitous Champions League campaign, but overall, Ten Hag is happy with his choice in goal and still feels there is more to come from him.",

      "Jose Mourinho is reportedly plotting a return to Manchester United with the Portuguese manager said to have unfinished business at Manchester United.",
      "Jose Mourinho has 'unfinished business' at Manchester United but would encounter the same old problem if he were to make a sensational return to Old Trafford.",
      "That's according to former England defender Glen Johnson, who played under the Portuguese boss at Chelsea from 2004-2007. A report in the Daily Mail suggested that Mourinho, who was recently sacked by Serie A club AS Roma after three years in Italy, wants a second spell as Red Devils boss as he feels that his work at Old Trafford was not completed. The report claims that the 61-year-old is keen to work under the new administration brought in by INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe following the billionaire's recent investment.",
      "Mourinho took charge of the United hot seat in 2016, guiding the club to EFL Cup success at Wembley before winning the Europa League with a 2-0 win against Ajax to secure a cup double in his first season. A year later he secured a second-place finish in the Premier League before losing the FA Cup final to his former club Chelsea.",
      "But after a poor start to his third season, Mourinho was relieved of his duties by United shortly before Christmas, bringing his project to a premature end. With current boss Erik ten Hag currently under pressure to fix the inconsistencies that have blighted United's current campaign, the club's former boss could be waiting in the wings for a second chance and retired full-back Johnson doesn't think the idea of Mourinho's return is all that far-fetched, even if he would still have to fix a familiar nagging issue.",
      "Speaking to Betfred, Johnson said: “He’s obviously a fantastic manager and regardless of whether there’s any substance to these rumours or not, there’s definitely some unfinished business between himself and Manchester United because he doesn’t usually go to these sorts of clubs and fail.",
      "“If he went back, it would be no different to the club that he left in the first place because the squad still isn’t good enough and they’re not performing well on a consistent basis. However, Manchester United is still a giant of a football club and on paper, their team looks pretty bloody good, but something isn’t right there.”",
      "Mourinho has won eight league titles across Europe including three Premier League titles with Chelsea. After leaving United he had a spell with Tottenham Hotspur before joining Italian giants Roma where he helped the capital club to win the Europa Conference League in 2022, ending their 11-year trophy drought.",

      "Former Manchester United captains Gary Neville and Roy Keane have claimed players at some of the clubs they faced in the Champions League during the mid-2000s were doping.",
      "In the '00s, United enjoyed one of their most dominant spells in history. With Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm, the Reds won the Premier League on six occasions, the League Cup three times and the FA Cup.",
      "However, the Champions League proved elusive until 2008 when they beat Chelsea on penalties in Moscow, ending a nine-year drought since that famous comeback against Bayern Munich to lift the trophy in 1999.",
      "United reached the last eight in seven consecutive seasons during the late 1990s and early 2000s, also making it to the semi-final in 2002 before falling to an agonising defeat to Bayer Leverkusen. Asked about the club's toughest nights in Europe, Neville recalled on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet: \"There are a couple which sticks in my mind, I am going to say this for legal reasons, I think there were a few teams we played against who weren’t clean. We thought it at the time.\"",
      "Agreeing, Keane added: \"We played against certain teams where I would be walking off and would be absolutely shattered and I would be looking at who I have been playing against, and they looked like they hadn’t even played a match. Why can’t we talk about that?\"",
      "Neville replied: \"You can’t accuse people…\" To which Jamie Carragher laughed: \"You just have!\"",
      "Concluding the discussion, Neville said: \"My point is when you look back at what came out after in cycling and other sports with doctors, you do think. We thought it at the time.",
      "\"Physically we were fit, we weren’t drinkers [but] that’s not right, there is something not right. I came off the pitch and I thought that’s not right, that’s not right I’m sorry.",
      "\"I know that a couple of the other lads in the mid-2000s thought exactly the same thing. That is the sort of thing for me where there are no excuses.\""

      "The former United player, who was part of the famous Class of 92, thinks that the current crop of young players like Kobbie Mainoo don't have the same support system he had. Mainoo has been a shining star for United this season, becoming a regular in Erik ten Hag's midfield.",

      "Former United captain Keane agrees with Neville's views on the current team under Ten Hag. He joined United from Nottingham Forest in 1993 and was instantly impressed by the dressing room atmosphere.",
      "\"I loved the dressing room,\" he said. \"I thought all these players were brilliant professionals, and I looked around and thought what a great group of people. Players like Bryan Robson, Ryan Giggs and Lee Sharpe, all amazing professional players.",
      "\"Remember the Cliff, our old training ground in Salford, I'd come in for a big fee at the time, but I was looking around the group and even the chat and the banter was great. My first pre-season we went to South Africa, and I couldn't believe how brilliant It was and how good the players were.",
      "\"We're talking about plenty of players when we played who would happily give tough love, but clearly no one is doing that at Manchester United for Marcus Rashford and that is one of the problems that the team has, they don't have that core group of players.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS face a huge decision over the future of Old Trafford, with options ranging from renovation work to a full rebuild of the Theatre of Dreams",
      "While most of the talk surrounding Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority takeover of Manchester United has focused on squad planning, given that the timing of the deal coincided with the January transfer window, the British billionaire and INEOS face big questions off the pitch as well - namely the future of Old Trafford.",
      "The fate of the Theatre of Dreams may not necessarily seem an immediate issue given United have problems to solve on the pitch given their disappointing form this season, but in a new era of Premier League financial regulations, a modern stadium looks set to be a dividing line when it comes to clubs' ambitions to be among the elite. Though Old Trafford is undoubtedly one of the UK's most impressive stadiums in terms of history, romance and sheer scale, it is no secret that Ratcliffe must make big changes if he is to realise his ambitions of returning United to the top table - both domestically and in Europe.",
      "There are multiple options in terms of what to do with the 114-year-old stadium. The Manchester Evening News understands renovations would be difficult due to the railway lines and the existing structures, and they have been advised a new build is the best option. Though enhancing the stadium would be cheaper than a full rebuild, it would take time and mean reduced capacity crowds, hitting United in the pocket during a period when the club has sailed close to the line in meeting the Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Another option would be to follow Tottenham's approach and build a new stadium in close proximity to Old Trafford, playing at the famous stadium while construction work is done. According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe's grand plan is to create a \"Wembley of the North\" in a full revamp which would turn the stadium into a world-leading venue.",
      "But each new option brings with it a tug at the heart-strings: few stadia have quite the romance of Old Trafford, with many nights of famous wins, trophies, legends and memories attached to it. It would be remiss to think of the Theatre of Dreams as mere bricks and mortar, and Ratcliffe will have to ensure that any decision made on the future of the stadium acknowledges just how special the ground is to millions of supporters.",
      "While decisions will eventually be taken, we want to know what you, the fans, think about the future of Old Trafford. What would you do with the Theatre of Dreams if you had the final say over its fate? Once you have voted in our Old Trafford poll above, join the debate and have your say in the comments section belo",

      "The Stockport-born midfielder, 18, is being widely tipped to force his way into Southgate's plans for this summer's showpiece event in Germany. Mainoo has become a key figure in United manager Erik ten Hag's thinking in the last few months and has scored two goals in his last three matches.",

He had the courage to try something different in the last minute of the game and it was a special moment.",
      "\"Mainoo is a special player, but as with every 18-year-old, we must just let them play because at the moment, Kobbie is just enjoying football in its purest form and that's what I like to see.\""

      "Pochettino joined PSG after 13 months out of work. Lille pipped PSG to the post to end their Ligue 1 monopoly and though Pochettino eventually completed a clean sweep of the domestic honours, the achievements were comme ci, comme ça.",
      "Senior members of the United dressing room preferred Pochettino to Ten Hag. His alliance with the Anglo contingent in the Southampton and Tottenham dressing rooms was viewed as a plus and he had the Premier League pedigree.",
      "He also assembled a sterling Tottenham team: Lloris, Walker, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose, Dier, Dembele, Alli, Eriksen, Son, Kane. United enquired about signing at least five of them and Sir Alex Ferguson urged Mourinho to buy Alli.",

John Murtough was nattering with Ten Hag's agent Kees Vos in the Old Trafford directors' box on Sunday and, however much longer he remains at the club, Ten Hag is his legacy. Murtough is proof there are figures at United capable of due diligence.",

      "Ten Hag has emerged from a chastening five months at United and is not out of the woods but last week was vindication. United demonstrated how clinically and efficiently they can play with their strongest players all available and they have plundered 11 goals in the last three games. They did not break double figures in the previous 10.",
      "Watching Pochettino mutter through uninspiring press conferences, there are shades of Mourinho during his second stint at Chelsea. There were times when he looked beaten in victory on the touchline. The assumption had been if he ever returned to England it would be to United - the job he wanted.",
      "If Pochettino had it his way, he would be sharing a glass of red with Ferguson in the directors' lounge every fortnight en route to a post-match press conference room. He would probably prefer to be at Tottenham's Enfield training base rather than Cobham.",

      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",

      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner at Molineux gets better every time you watch it. It was a moment of individual brilliance and Rasmus Hojlund described him as a 'generational talent' after the game.",
      "Erik ten Hag also gave him a glowing assessment. \"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "In a separate interview with MUTV, Ten Hag added: \"What he did was great, no doubt about that. He's a calm person and it looks like he grows from game to game, so hopefully he keeps this going.",
      "\"I will push and support him, but he has to do it. He has great abilities and in the future, he can be a great player. Today, we have seen it, but also in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has a strong record of developing talent and Mainoo is at the right place to take his game to another level.",
      "His potential is frightening and a new star from Carrington has been born. He could be everything Pogba was supposed to be for United.",

      "The Reds' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City last week saw them finish second in Group B, with their otherwise exemplary record in this season's competition meaning they were set to advance to the last eight as one of two best-placed runners-up. However, Aston Villa's decision to field January signing Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 win over Sunderland has had a knock-on effect on Marc Skinner's side, who will now not progress to the knockout stages.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Manchester United's star goalkeeper Mary Earps is in demand as she enters the last six months of her contract",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps has joined the A&V Sports agency amid uncertainty surrounding her future with the Reds.",
      "Earps has entered into the last six months of her contract with United and there are no guarantees she will be extending her stay. Barcelona, PSG and Arsenal have all been linked with the 30-year-old who is in-demand.",
      "The shot stopper's stock rose last year thanks to a sensational 12 months for club and country. Among the many accolades she accumulated were BBC Sports Personality of the Year, England Women's Player of the Year and she was also named Manchester United fans' Player of the Year, across the men's and women's teams, by MEN Sport readers.",
      "Back in December, United's head coach Marc Skinner declared he was hopeful Earps would commit to a new contract. \"The club are working through with Mary on what the deal looks like,\" Skinner told the Daily Mirror.",
      "\"I sit here hopeful. I think the talks are exactly where it was. It’s with the club to continue with that. I can’t be any more clear that I want Mary to stay at this club.",
      "\"She’s a huge part of what I want to do and build here but we’ll continue to have those conversations. I haven’t really got an update yet.\"",
      "Earps' new representatives are one of the top agencies in women's football and look after the likes of Sam Kerr, Ada Hegerberg and Catarina Macario. The United 'keeper signed her last contract back in 2021.",

      "Thursday 8 February 2024 20:42, UK",
      "It is an image which will be referenced and reused in years to come.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration at the Argentine's first goal in the win over West Ham, immediately struck as an iconic moment.",
      "But whether it will be looked back on as the dawning of a new era of success for United or a brief flash of promise which faded away will be down to that talented trio, the group around them and the work of head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "Promise is one thing but at United results are demanded right now.",
      "That was the message emphasised by Ten Hag as he sat down with Sky Sports at United's training ground, still warming up after a session out in the sleet and wind at Carrington. They were tough conditions, he says, but these are the decisive days - and even in February, United are in must-win mode.",
      "Back-to-back victories last week against Wolves and West Ham have boosted the mood - \"It gives confidence,\" says the Dutchman - but if the team are to achieve Champions League qualification, the eight-point gap to fourth-placed Aston Villa must be closed when United go to play Unai Emery's men on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "\"We have some exciting players,\" smiles Ten Hag when asked about Hojlund (aged 21), Garnacho (19) and Mainoo (18) sat together.",
      "\"We also have had such [standout] moments during the season - for instance, the brilliant goal from Garnacho against Everton,\" he says, referencing that spectacular overhead kick at Goodison Park.",
      "\"We have some very high potentials in this squad. And now we have to perform to high levels.",
      "\"We do it now in some games but on Sunday, for instance, we get an opposition who have a very high level. So that's a challenge to perform there and to get end product from those players on Sunday. So they are the next steps, which have to come.\"",
      "Ten Hag knows all about the power and momentum in-form young players can bring to a team. It was a driving force during his time at Ajax. It has also long been a foundation for success at United.",
      "Coupled with the experience of players such as Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, it can be a winning formula.",
      "\"They bring energy,\" says Ten Hag of his young players. \"I think it's always a combination of experience and high potentials. And when they respect each other, and they want to strengthen each other, then you have a team and that is always the objective because every player knows when there is a team you can achieve higher performances and higher levels and so achieve more.\"",
      "Another key ingredient, of course, is goals. And in Hojlund, United now have a striker who looks to have finally found his feet in the Premier League. There were a flurry of strikes in Europe earlier in this campaign but with four goals in his last four top-flight games, it feels like the big-money summer signing is now starting to deliver.",
      "That scoring streak began against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, when he hit a late winner in a comeback victory at Old Trafford. The relief and release of pressure when that ball found the net was plain to see in his celebration. But it is perhaps the consistency of selection in attack which has maintained his run of form.",
      "In each of United's last four Premier League games, they've had Marcus Rashford and Garnacho flanking the young Dane. The front three have a combined 10 goals and three assists in those matches - more than the 10 goal involvements they've registered between them in other Premier League games this season.",
      "\"Football is about co-operation,\" says Ten Hag. \"Finding the spaces by movements, by moving the ball and bringing players into positions where they can attack opponents or get into one-on-one situations. And then those players have the abilities to score goals.\"",
      "Finding familiar patterns and combinations across the pitch has been an issue for United and Ten Hag throughout this campaign because of a long list of injuries. Ten Hag celebrated the fact he could finally name his strongest XI for the first time this term against Wolves last week. A game later, he lost Lisandro Martinez to a knee injury.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" he says when asked if that has been the great frustration of this season. \"It stops the progress.",
      "\"Every time you have to adjust you don't have routines, you don't have partnerships and that is what we have seen.",
      "\"I think we have had nine different set-ups in the centre-half positions. In other positions we have to swap a lot and that was forced by injuries so we hope now we can keep a consistent team.\"",
      "United will certainly have to be at their best this weekend. Ten Hag describes the work of his counterpart at Aston Villa, Unai Emery, as \"incredible\", and the hosts will be eager to respond to their surprise FA Cup replay loss to Chelsea on Wednesday night. But this is the time when United need their stars - and rising stars - to step up.",
      "\"We know we can beat them,\" says Ten Hag, referring to the Boxing Day win. \"But Sunday is a new game. It's a test. We have to take the chance.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly looking to build a new stadium for Manchester United; the British billionaire is set to acquire a £1.2bn stake in the club and will put £239m into the club's infrastructure; Ratcliffe wants to build a 'Wembley of the North'",
      "Thursday 8 February 2024 06:12, UK",
      "Are Manchester United getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators.",
      "The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "Billionaire Ratcliffe, who founded the INEOS group, is acquiring a 25 per cent stake of United for a fee of £1.2bn, which moved a step closer after a successful vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday.",
      "\"I was told that Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned up for one of his meetings and he had the feeling that for arguably the biggest football club in the world, the wow factor just wasn't there. I agree with that,\" said United We Stand Editor Andy Mitten to Sky Sports News.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land.",
      "United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.",
      "As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow.",
      "\"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,\" he said.",
      "\"I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.\"",
      "Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world-class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan.\"",
      "Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future...",
      "Oh, quite a lot. \"Old Trafford is falling down\" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season.",
      "The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland.",
      "\"The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,\" added Mitten.",
      "\"It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium.",
      "\"The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low.",
      "\"Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger.\"",
      "Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing.",
      "\"It's important that you have pride in where you play and Old Trafford is an amazing stadium.\"",
      "The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium.",
      "That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago.",
      "Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation.",
      "\"From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,\" he said.",
      "\"I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area.",
      "\"Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium.",
      "\"I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world.\"",
      "Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019.",
      "One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans.",
      "The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010.",
      "The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn.",
      "Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020.",
      "As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work.",
      "United could lobby The Government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: \"Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future.\"",
      "But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money.",
      "And United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?",

      "The Radar column looks at the curious reluctance to praise Mikel Arteta's work at Arsenal and how Rasmus Hojlund has taken matters into his own hands to solve his scoring issues at Manchester United; Plus: Valentino Livramento's push for a Newcastle starting spot",
      "Thursday 8 February 2024 17:46, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta takes his Arsenal side to West Ham's London Stadium on Super Sunday on the back of a resounding victory over leaders Liverpool which reignited their Premier League title hopes.",
      "The underlying numbers highlighted Arsenal's superiority. Their total of 3.50 expected goals was the highest by any side against Liverpool on record. At the other end of the pitch, Jurgen Klopp's team were limited to only 0.37 expected goals, their lowest total of the season.",
      "It was an outstanding display, even factoring in the defensive lapse which allowed Liverpool back into the game on the stroke of half-time. But all that was rather lost in the fallout.",
      "Instead, the focus centred on the manner in which they enjoyed it. Arteta is not the first manager to celebrate a crucial goal by sprinting out of his technical area. Jurgen Klopp can testify to that. But rarely has the act provoked quite so much censure. At least not since the last time he did it.",
      "The obsession with Arteta's touchline behaviour fails to acknowledge the role of his emotional investment in improving the atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium. His intensity feeds into that of the crowd. Home advantage has been enhanced.",
      "Sunday's game was just the latest example. A once indifferent arena now crackles with anticipation for the biggest games. Connections have been forged. The mood has been transformed.",
      "If Arteta's perceived ill-discipline is somehow setting a bad example, it is not rubbing off on his players. They have received the fewest bookings in the Premier League this season having gone through the entirety of last term without a red card.",
      "More important than all that, though, is that Arteta has created a team capable of producing results like the one they celebrated on Sunday with increasing regularity.",
      "Arsenal have played six games against big-six opponents in the Premier League this season and not lost once. Manchester City, like Liverpool, left the Emirates defeated, having managed only 0.48 expected goals, a figure that remains their lowest of the season.",
      "Arteta has been healthily backed, of course. Both in terms of time and financial support. But Arsenal's re-emergence as contenders over the last 18 months owes more to him than any signing.",
      "The role of his coaching can be seen in the improvement of individuals across the squad. But it is even clearer in the collective. Arsenal have become the best side in the division defensively. Key performance indicators suggest they are up there offensively too.",
      "There remains a curious reluctance to praise his work. But this is what Arteta has created. A team rivalling the elite. A manager in his first job going toe to toe with two of the best in modern history in Pep Guardiola and Klopp. He deserves better than the trivial focus on how he and his players choose to celebrate.",
      "The goals are finally flowing for Rasmus Hojlund. Having not found the net once in his first 14 Premier League appearances, the striker, a £72m signing from Atalanta, now has four in four.",
      "His thrilling potential is shining through. It is a cause for celebration for Manchester United. But it would be hasty to say they have figured out how to get the best out of him. More accurate is that Hojlund has found ways of doing the job himself.",
      "Consider the fact that only one of his last five goals in all competitions, his late strike in the FA Cup fourth-round win over Newport County included, has been assisted by a team-mate.",
      "And even that goal, Sunday's opener against West Ham, was largely of Hojlund's own making as he collected Casemiro's interception with his back to goal before dummying his way past two defenders and brilliantly finding the bottom corner from the edge of the box.",
      "In total in the Premier League this season, a third of Hojlund's 24 shots have been unassisted. The same can be said for more than half of his 10 goals in all competitions. Without a reliable supply line, the Dane is having to generate his own chances.",
      "Wasteful finishing has been a factor too, of course. Hojlund missed nine big chances without scoring in the first half of the season, according to Opta. But the shot numbers are revealing.",
      "His average of 1.66 attempts per 90 minutes is the fifth-lowest of the 40 strikers to have played at least 400 minutes in the Premier League this season. Hojlund sits between Lyle Foster of Burnley and Sheffield United's Cameron Archer. It speaks to United's issues that their back-up striker, Anthony Martial, is even lower.",
      "Erik ten Hag spoke of improved service and better balance in United's front line after the win over West Ham, referencing the decision to switch Alejandro Garnacho to the right flank in recent games while restoring Marcus Rashford to the left.",
      "But the numbers show no tangible change to the number of chances Hojlund is getting. In fact, his four goals in four games since Boxing Day have come from only six shots, a total bettered by 73 players in the Premier League in the same timeframe.",
      "Across the four Premier League games in which Garnacho has started on the right with Rashford on the left, the pair have only found Hojlund with five and six passes respectively. He remains on the periphery, averaging only 26 touches per 90 minutes.",
      "Could it be that the responsibility lies with Hojlund himself? It seems unlikely given the quality of his movement. He ranks among the Premier League's top 10 players for attacking runs per 90 minutes and only slightly lower for runs challenging the opponent's backline.",
      "The problem is that United's wide forwards have other priorities. Rashford and Garnacho are averaging nearly twice as many shots as Hojlund. Given how infrequently they pass to him, it is hardly surprising they have only created six chances for him all season.",
      "It is to Hojlund's credit that he has found ways around the issue.",
      "Against Tottenham, a stunning finish slammed into the roof of the net after Rashford had been tackled while dribbling into his zone. Against FC Copenhagen, a rebound slotted home after Garnacho declined to square the ball to him for a simple finish.",
      "He is adapting, learning to rely on his own quality and intuition rather than the service of others. But for how much longer can he feast on scraps? Manchester United must find ways of feeding him properly if his recent scoring feats are to continue.",
      "Dan Burn will not remember his battle with Luton's Chiedozie Ogbene fondly. In fact, it is probably a stretch to term it as such given its one-sidedness as Rob Edwards' side claimed a 4-4 draw.",
      "At £13m, the 31-year-old has been an excellent signing for Eddie Howe's side, adjusting from centre-back to full-back admirably and playing an important role in last season's Champions League finish.",
      "But as Newcastle continue to ship goals at an alarming rate - they have already conceded more this season than in the whole of last term - the case for Valentino Livramento to step in grows stronger.",
      "Left-back is not the 21-year-old's favoured position, of course. He is naturally right sided. But his substitute appearance against Luton, when he helped Newcastle recover to salvage a draw, was just the latest example of his capacity to play there.",
      "His drive gave Newcastle a new dimension in attack. At the other end, while Burn was dribbled past four times in 63 minutes, Livramento was not beaten once. He has in fact only been dribbled past nine times in 19 Premier League and Champions League appearances all season.",
      "His versatility is not lost on Howe, who has used him on both sides since his £40m arrival from Southampton in the summer. After Saturday's game, he described him as an \"outstanding player\" who will have a \"huge bearing\" on the club's future.",
      "But maybe the future is now. Against Nottingham Forest, live on Sky Sports on Saturday, Livramento will be ready and waiting to step in.",

      "From NFL to go-karting - football stadiums won't just be about football; Why stadiums should stay at the heart of cities; Sustainability must be 'at the forefront'; Why Barca, Real Madrid and Liverpool are re-purposing, not moving; 'Remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design'",
      "Wednesday 7 February 2024 13:40, UK",
      "It is not even 20 years ago that Emirates Stadium and Wembley Stadium were best in class for stadium design in the UK and around the world.",
      "While both are still considered excellent venues for hosting top-class football and events, there is no hiding the advancements in stadium design in such a short space of time, with the opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019, and other new stadiums around the world.",
      "But are brand new stadiums the future?",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators. The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage. Could those plans include the renovation of Old Trafford?",
      "Last summer, as part of Sky Sports' Future of Football series, with the help of the architects designing and the clubs building the stadiums, we took a look at some of the key developments in stadium design and what could be around the corner in stadiums of the future.",
      "Are Man Utd getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "Renovation and refurbishment is certain to play a huge part in stadium design in the future.",
      "We are already seeing that in Spain. The renovation of one of the world's most famous football stadiums is well underway as the Espai Barca project sees Barcelona upgrade the Camp Nou and renovate 18 acres of the area surrounding the stadium.",
      "Real Madrid are another club going through the same process with the Santiago Bernabeu and in England, Liverpool are continuing to make improvements to Anfield. Those projects come in comparison to Everton, who are building a brand new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.",
      "Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, believes the model adopted by the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the future of stadium design, suggesting Manchester United's Old Trafford could be a candidate for renovation in the future in the same vein as the Camp Nou, particularly with sustainability in mind.",
      "He said: \"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums.",
      "\"I know why Everton moved but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.",
      "\"First, you need to look long and hard at why you cannot upgrade that as the starting point,\" he added. \"There are so many positives to that and for many English clubs in the future that will be their starting point, and it should be.",
      "\"You can get everything you need by doing that and also you can save a lot of carbon by doing so.\"",
      "Another key part of the evolution of stadium design is the ability for an arena to be reconfigured and used for more than one purpose, hosting multiple sports and event types. For example, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium it is not uncommon to see football one weekend, American football the following weekend, a music concert in midweek and later this year you'll even see a karting track at the stadium, which will be set up perfectly for each individual event.",
      "Chris Lee, who is the managing director of global design firm Populous, who were the architects and lead designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, will have seen this change first hand from his involvement with the Emirates Stadium project and then as project director of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Not only do these events allow a club to increase their revenue and bring a wider programme of events that can be enjoyed by spectators, but it also provides a more sustainable stadium that can be enjoyed for many years by a huge number of people.",
      "For new stadiums all over the world, being multi-functional with, for example, moving pitches and a retractable roof to help facilitate multi-use design, is a top priority.",
      "Lee said: \"From a societal perspective, having these big venues sitting in the middle of our communities where they are important but then being able to be used literally seven days a week, whether it is your local football team, rugby, NFL or concerts, I think that is really important from many perspectives.",
      "\"From an architect's and designer's perspective, being able to reconfigure space is really exciting. We now have the technology to be able to have huge bits of buildings literally moving to be able to reconfigure them, so they are all perfect.",
      "\"We tried this as architects in the 60s. We saw great visionary stadiums like the Aloha in Hawaii where stands moved or roofs moved, never particularly successfully, but now I think we are at a point where we have engineering technology where we can genuinely reconfigure buildings.",
      "\"Every stadium and every location is different,\" he added. \"But we have to work with our clubs and our partners to see how we can accommodate the multi-use piece, but accommodate it so it is perfect.",
      "\"If you looked at Tottenham, it was designed clearly as the perfect stadium for Spurs. Premier League football was at the heart of it, but it is also really the first bespoke NFL stadium built outside of the continental US.",
      "\"Sightlines work, locker rooms work, everything works, and when you go in there for a Tottenham game to an NFL exhibition game, it's a different venue. It feels different, it looks different and works perfectly for both codes.\"",
      "There was a trend, particularly in America, for stadiums to be pushed to the outskirts of towns and cities. However modern stadiums have moved back into the heart of their communities.",
      "The stadiums are now the centre piece of the local community and are a hub of activity all year round. It can also lead to a regeneration of the area as improvements are made to the local facilities and transport links in the area, benefitting the whole community.",
      "An example is Fulham's new Riverside Stand - designed by Populous - which will not only increase Craven Cottage's capacity by 3,000 seats to 28,000, but will also house restaurants, bars, a hotel, health club, and conference and event spaces.",
      "The project will also see a riverside walkway open that will help provide community amenities on matchdays and non-matchdays, and also allow the public to walk along the banks of the Thames between Hammersmith and Putney bridges for the first time.",
      "\"When we look at our cities, particularly in the UK and around Europe, our cities grew up around these buildings,\" Lee said. \"They are part of our fabric and part of our daily lives. The game on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, the circus comes into town and the stadium changes.",
      "\"I think it is important the stadiums stay in our communities. If we looked in the 70s and 80s, there was a move on an urban planning level to say these buildings are bad neighbours and we'll push them to the edges of the cities.",
      "\"In America, cities moving their stadiums to the outskirts and surrounding them by literally acres of black top car parking was the norm and then in the 90s, and actually with a baseball stadium we did in Baltimore at Camdens Yard, it was to help the clubs and the stadium are actually good neighbours and they are good regenerators.",
      "\"A key part of the future will be how we can move stadiums sensitively back into our cities, keep them there and then bring the life, the fans and the regeneration that spills out from them into our local communities.\"",
      "Heverin also believes stadium design should be and will be pushed in the future to come up with new ways to involve the communities.",
      "He said: \"We should be pushed to think of more interesting ways to involve the community.",
      "\"We have a project where we've looked at a ground concourse that could also work as a market. You can set up stalls in the concourse and really use the space as a covered market out of matchdays.",
      "\"It's a really interesting way to look at the concourse, a more public way rather than just for those who pay a certain amount of money, for example to use conference facilities.\"",
      "Heverin is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue.",
      "The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as \"the world's first timber stadium.\"",
      "Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts.",
      "\"The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,\" he said. \"Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else.",
      "\"There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero.",
      "\"The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,\" he added. \"For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles.",
      "\"When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain.",
      "\"It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too.",
      "\"I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch.\"",
      "For Barcelona, sustainability played a part in their decision to upgrade the Camp Nou, along with what the new campus can bring to the surrounding neighbourhoods around the stadium.",
      "Alex Barbany, head of business development of the Espai Barca project told Sky Sports: \"In the current times, sustainability is a given. You cannot just go ahead with a project like this without giving thought to sustainability.",
      "\"At Camp Nou, we are preserving the first two tiers and building the third from scratch. One hundred per cent of the gravel is being recycled, 50 per cent of it will be recycled into our own project and the other will be used for other projects across the city after we reached an agreement with the town hall.",
      "\"We are paying special attention to delivering solar panels on the roof so we can use renewable energy for our own consumption in the building.",
      "\"Sustainability has to be the norm all over the world. The fact we are renovating the stadium and not demolishing it and building it as brand new, that makes us feel proud.\"",
      "Barcelona, who enjoy a huge number of visitors to the club, are equally proud of the part their new facilities will play as they look to make their campus more \"relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community\" with site that will have a constant stream events all year round.",
      "Barbany said: \"There are very few stadiums around the world that sit at the heart of a global capital city like Barcelona, which has a huge touristic graphic and flow.",
      "\"There are very few of those and new projects which are being built in such sizeable and central locations of an international appeal like Barcelona.",
      "\"If you add on top of that the strength and the quality of the brand of Barca, that sort of sizeable, central location within a city like Barcelona, we believe it makes it truly unique.",
      "\"Having the luxury of the central location and the flexibility and land around the stadium is making it possible to do what we are doing. That is what is enabling us to deliver that community element and make the neighbourhood and the city truly become part of it, especially beyond matchday.",
      "\"On non-matchdays, roughly 95 per cent of the traffic on campus is from tourists and visitors. One of our main challenges is to become much more relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community so they are just not thinking about us on a matchday but to have rotating content which makes the Camp Nou and the arena relevant, in terms of entertainment options on any given day or weekend.",
      "\"You don't always have the opportunity in your lifetime to reshape the largest stadium in the world and to develop a brand new campus in the city centre of a city like Barcelona, which pretty much everyone in the world knows what it is and where it is.",
      "\"This will be the true legacy of this club for the next generations, and that is what keeps everyone so excited about the project.\"",
      "Head of Business Development of Espai Barça Project Alex Barbany:\n\n\n“It’s always the dilemma for a club like ours.\n“We have 100 millions fans all over the place and obviously it is really hard for many of them to come over to Barcelona and enjoy the live experience.\n\n\n“It’s definitely one of the main challenges for the industry.\n\n\n“The fans around the world are connecting with us through social media, and that is the channel where we get the most interaction with our fans, but at the moment we don’t have the right products to engage with them and to monetise it yet.”",
      "Barcelona are also looking to the future, revealing the Camp Nou upgrades are a \"catalyst for the digital transformation of the club\", and they are not the only club keeping an eye on the digital and technological revolution.",
      "With the global reach of the world's top clubs continuing to grow every season, increasing profile beyond the physical footprint of fans attending the stadiums will be high on the agenda as virtual and augmented reality is explored.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"Looking forwards, there is talk about the rise of the metaverse - the ability to use augmented and virtual reality to bring a matchday experience to people's own homes.",
      "\"Manchester United claim to have 1.1bn followers around the world. So, instead of Manchester United being limited to 75,000 people being able to attend Old Trafford, why can't we have some form of match taking place at Old Trafford physically and then have it also simultaneously being broadcast in some 3D format to New York, Lagos, Melbourne and Beijing, and you've got 40 or 50,000 fans attending there.",
      "\"All of a sudden, those people are willing to pay the equivalent of 30 or 40 bucks to be in a stadium or 10 bucks to to have that matchday experience at home.\"",
      "We saw a small glimpse of what the future might hold during the Covid-19 pandemic when fans were locked out of stadiums for a period of time, forcing them to watch games at home, linking up with friends and family on Zoom.",
      "So, how does this evolve and what does it mean for stadium design?",
      "Populous managing director Lee said: \"The live remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design.",
      "\"None of us could possibly predict where digital is going in any sphere, let alone sport, so our job is really to provide an immensely robust backbone that we can accommodate any kinds of potential future digital uses.",
      "\"But I think AR, VR and hybrid realities are absolutely going to play a part in our future experience, whether it is in stadium or the remote audience.\"",
      "\"Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones famously said one per cent of Cowboys fans are going to visit the AT&T stadium, so it's how to deal with the other 99 per cent who won't ever visit that stadium but you know are watching that game at the same time in bars and restaurants all around the world.",
      "\"It's about how you connect those people and that's the exciting bit,\" he added.",
      "\"We had glimpses of this during the pandemic - the Zoom audiences and the carboard cut-outs in stadiums - but what that showed me was that the live audience is critical. Without the live audience, sport is very different and a very different live experience. But equally, you know that there are 10,000 to 100,000 people and more in little bars around the world, in Sao Paulo, in Sydney and other places, watching that game.",
      "\"The question is how we can have those audiences interacting in the same space, digitally.",
      "\"Fans, atmosphere and experience, will always play a huge part in stadium design going forward, but digital is probably going to be the biggest change we see.\"",
      "So, could we be heading to virtual stadiums with family, friends and strangers for matchday experiences in the coming years? Virtual and augmented reality is a topic we looked at in further detail in our Future of Football series.",

      "Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left.",
      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",
      "West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd.",
      "It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured.",

      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",

      "Plus: Lack of belief costs West Ham at Man Utd; Nottingham Forest show signs that they can get themselves out of Premier League relegation trouble after draw at Bournemouth",
      "Monday 5 February 2024 13:55, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was \"unbelievable\" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a \"streetwise\" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho.",
      "\"I always say that he is an example, a role model,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him.\"",
      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"

      "Sunday 4 February 2024 12:28, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

      "Saturday 3 February 2024 10:23, UK",
      "After an agonising midweek of bad beats, Jones Knows is hoping to punish the bookmakers with his weekend 6/1 treble.",
      "Punters are the kings at talking through their pocket. No group of people do it better. So pardon the frustration that's about to let rip regarding the two losing bets from the midweek action. Somehow both 8/1 shots lost.",
      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",
      "Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 4/5 on 50+ booking points looks a winner in waiting to me.",

      "Report and highlights as Kobbie Mainoo's goal won a seven-goal thriller for Manchester United at Molineux. Pedro Neto had equalised for Wolves in stoppage time. United led by two goals twice with Marcus Rashford scoring on his return to the team",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 14:03, UK",
      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational 97th-minute winner for Manchester United after Wolves themselves had levelled in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 game at Molineux.",
      "Marcus Rashford, restored to the team, opened the scoring and Rasmus Hojlund doubled the lead before the break with United dominant but the drama had hardly begun.",
      "Pablo Sarabia pulled one back from the spot before another substitute, Scott McTominay restored the two-goal advantage. Max Kilman's late goal offered Wolves hope and Pedro Neto thought he had secured a point before Mainoo's magnificent winner.",
      "It was a breathless contest to ultimately delight the visiting Manchester United support, although even the crestfallen home team were applauded from the pitch.",
      "Wolves had not lost at home since being beaten by Liverpool in September and could have moved above United with victory. Instead, they remain 11th in the table while Ten Hag's team are up to seventh.",
      "Wolves: Sa (5), Kilman (6), Dawson (6), Toti (4), Semedo (6), Doyle (6), Lemina (6), Doherty (4), Bellegarde (5), Neto (7), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ait-Nouri (7), Sarabia (7), Gomes (n/a), Fraser (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (5), Dalot (6), Varane (6), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Mainoo (8), Casemiro (6), Garnacho (6), Fernandes (7), Rashford (7), Hojlund (7).\n\n\nSubs: Antony (5), McTominay (7), Maguire (n/a), Evans (n/a), Forson (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ten Hag said before kick-off that this might be Manchester United's strongest side and things would look different once the injured players had returned and they played as if that were true during the opening period, scoring before Wolves had really had a kick.",
      "Hojlund laid the ball off to Rashford and the returning favourite caressed the ball beyond Jose Sa and into the corner of the net. It oozed cool and made a mockery of the fuss that has surrounded him all week. United just seemed to grow in confidence thereafter.",
      "Wolves were tactically undone for the second goal, Neto failing to track the powerful off-the-ball run of Luke Shaw and when Rashford slipped him in, the full-back's low cross was bundled into the net by Hojlund after earlier ricocheting off Craig Dawson and Sa.",
      "Hojlund almost had another when Matt Doherty's under-hit pass to the goalkeeper resulted in the clearance cannoning off him but just wide. The Denmark forward was then denied when a narrow offside decision went against him after tucking the ball away late in the first half.",
      "Casemiro, booked early on but otherwise restoring control to United's midfield, found the net with a header before that half was through but was again offside and the onus was on O'Neil to change things at the break. The tone of the game certainly shifted.",
      "Kilman had a header cleared from near the line by Lisandro Martinez, making his first Premier League start since September. Hojlund then spurned a good chance after an error by Toti Gomes. But the penalty offered Wolves a route back into it.",
      "The decision to award the spot-kick was soft, Casemiro barely connecting with Neto - if at all. But Sarabia, on as a substitute, converted and the crowd were in the game. United struck again. McTominay did not even have to jump to nod in United's third from a corner.",
      "Again, Wolves fought back. They showed real spirit in the second half, defending that long unbeaten run at home. Dawson's miscued shot was turned in by Kilman to set up a big finish. Neto delivered it when United inexplicably allowed a counter-attack.",
      "His shot appeared to wrong-foot Andre Onana and Molineux was wild, dreaming of an unlikely winner of their own. But, amid a raucous atmosphere, it was Mainoo who was calm while others were not, skipping away from two before curling effortlessly into the corner.",
      "It was a goal that will be talked about for years, the biggest moment of his fledgling career to date - and a big moment for his manager and team. Had United let this slip, it would have been damning. But this was a night to remember for the right reasons, instead.",
      "\"To be honest, I have mixed feelings,\" said Ten Hag. \"For the neutral, for the spectator, it is great to see. But as a manager, when you have dominated for an hour and should be three or four up, the way we concede the goals, we should manage it better, it cannot happen.\"",
      "\"Incredibly proud of some of what we produced, the resilience, the togetherness, the quality, there were large spells when we looked close to being an excellent team,\" said the Wolves boss. \"There were little bits that we need to improve, obviously.\"",
      "He added: \"The two goals in the second half, very disappointing as it is down to detail. The throw-in at the end is not how we defend throw-ins.",
      "\"You are tested in the Premier League, the emotion of it. We go completely off plan [after Rashford's early goal] and start opening up big spaces. But in terms of the togetherness, the work ethic, I thought second half, we were by far the better side.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Gary Neville:",
      "\"I was a part of those games when you've given a goal away at one end and somehow one of your special players would do something special and the goal was sensational by Mainoo. We've seen different types of goals but for him to keep such composure and put the ball in between someone's legs and the finish!",
      "\"He's a fantastic player. I think to come into Man Utd team in any team is very difficult and he's come into the team in one of the club's most difficult times in recent history and he's just stood out as being someone whose temperament and composure is off the scale.",
      "\"He's got the world at his feet for the next few years and there's been an example where you can get carried away: Marcus Rashford had the same. But he's got 15 years coming up, Mainoo, where he's got to keep feet on the ground. But he's got all the attributes that you would need to be a top player.\"",

      "Plus from Wednesday: Connor Bradley steals the show as Liverpool beat Chelsea; Julian Alvarez grabs the headlines as Erling Haaland returns for Man City in their win over Burnley; Timo Werner shows the value of Tottenham conducting their transfer business early as he helps beat Brentford",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 00:50, UK",
      "“He’s making incredible progress. He is the modern midfield player.” Erik ten Hag was effusive in his praise for Kobbie Mainoo after his dramatic winner at Wolves - and understandably so.",
      "Casemiro. Fred. Donny van de Beek. Nemanja Matic. So many millions have been spent by Manchester United as they tried to find a player to command their midfield. Now, it seems an answer may have sprung from their academy.",
      "To prove Ten Hag’s point, Mainoo excelled in attack and defence at Molineux, ranking joint-first among United players for possession wins (six) while also sealing the points with a goal of rare composure.",
      "It’s already clear Mainoo is part of United’s strongest XI. He offers more physicality than Christian Eriksen, more skill than Scott McTominay and more dynamism than Casemiro.",
      "If Mainoo maintains his current trajectory, it’s not unreasonable to think he could even sneak into an England squad that is not exactly blessed with midfielders at the peak of their form.",
      "But even if he falls short in that aim, the 18-year-old looks as though he has saved United a fortune in the transfer market.Joe Shread",
      "Gary O'Neil spent much of his post-match press conference discussing the challenge of trying - and ultimately failing - to bring in another striker this transfer window but Wolves managed to score three goals against Manchester United and still lost.",
      "It was the details that cost them. The third goal from a corner was routine and the fourth goal came from a throw-in. Wolves appeared caught up in the emotion of the game, while Mainoo was the coolest character in the stadium. It proved the difference.",
      "O'Neil prides himself on those tactical details, which is perhaps why he was so frustrated that his match-preparation time had been disrupted by trying to get a deal over the line. He described having a game on deadline day as a \"terrible idea\" afterwards.",
      "But if there was some comfort in being beaten at home for the first time in over four months it was that even in a sloppy performance, there was a spirit, a work ethic, the sort of togetherness that has his team in mid-table rather than facing the drop as some expected.",
      "Wolves have served up some drama already at Molineux this season, beating Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. They came out on the wrong side of this seven-goal thriller but it said plenty that their players were applauded off the pitch at the end of the game.Adam Bate",
      "David Moyes threw Kalvin Phillips in at the deep and to a certain extent it backfired, but having not made a single start in the Premier League this season for Man City, the England international was always going to take time to get up to speed.",
      "He endured a nightmare start to his West Ham debut, playing the ball straight to Dominic Solanke to score Bournemouth's opener. His struggles continued during the first half and an off-the-pace Phillips was eventually replaced in the 68th minute by Danny Ings.",
      "However, Phillips' lack of sharpness was probably understandable considering his bit-part role at Man City over the last couple of years.",
      "What is important now is how the 28-year-old improves from here. He's been crying out for minutes, particularly as he tries to win a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.",
      "After his first start against Bournemouth, he will be hoping more follow and that he can build and improve quickly.Oliver Yew",
      "David Moyes' pre- and post-match commentary was telling. \"We've had to rejig,\" he said before kick-off, in reference to Kalvin Phillips' inclusion. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" he conceded after the full-time whistle.",
      "The teamsheet looked imbalanced from the off. Four central midfielders and no striker. Of course Moyes has been hamstrung by injuries and absences in recent weeks, but attempting to crowbar four midfielders into the starting XI caused more harm than good against high-pressing Bournemouth.",
      "Phillips looked lost. Edson Alvarez was scrappy and ineffective. Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were better, but ever-changing shape restricted their influence. Debutant Phillips registered an error leading to a goal with only his second touch in a Hammers shirt - it was all a bit messy and confused.",
      "That will be the first and last time we'll see that midfield concoction this season, or ever. Question is, where does Phillips fit now? West Ham's central trio - Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek - have forged good connections in the first half of this season. Why disrupt it unnecessarily?Laura Hunter",
      "The roar that greeted Conor Bradley's goal in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea was that little bit louder than the rest. It was a reward for his fine form since coming into the side but it was also a reminder that Jurgen Klopp is building an exciting new team.",
      "Bradley has looked assured defensively, combative in the tackle, impressive in possession and has now shown a finishing ability that Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez would envy. He is more than filling in for Trent Alexander-Arnold. He was a worthy player of the match.",
      "With two assists as well as his goal, the Northern Ireland international has certainly won over the Anfield crowd - they chanted his name more than once on the night. He looks like a strength rather than a weakness, highlighting the depth in this squad now.",
      "That gives Klopp options, the opportunity to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield rather than at right-back, for instance. Expect him to have a big impact this season and beyond. At a time when the focus is on Liverpool stories coming to an end, another is just beginning.Adam Bate",
      "Once again, it's two steps forward, two steps back for Chelsea. After winning three in a row in the Premier League for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, his side produced a woeful display at Anfield.",
      "It was the same in November, when Chelsea followed up impressive results against Tottenham and Manchester City by getting thrashed at Newcastle.",
      "But even more worrying than the inconsistency - or the one-sided result - was the nature of Chelsea's performance against Liverpool.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side were predictably fired up in their first Premier League game since he announced his planned exit, but it seemingly caught Chelsea by surprise.",
      "The visitors were second to everything. They continuously gave the ball away in dangerous areas. They lost their runners.",
      "Investing in youth has had the predictable consequence of leaving Chelsea short of two vital components that make up successful teams - experience and leadership.",
      "Never was it more apparent than on Wednesday night.Joe Shread",
      "Erling Haaland's return from injury against Burnley was a major boost for Manchester City. His second-half introduction was cheered as loudly as any of their goals. But it was Julian Alvarez who inflicted most of the damage on the night.",
      "His double, scored in the space of six first-half minutes, took him to eight for the campaign in the Premier League and 15 overall. He also has six assists. He is quietly having an excellent season.",
      "And yet a look at the statistics on Wednesday night suggests he did little other than score. The Argentine only had 24 touches, by far the fewest of City's starters, and only completed 12 passes. His goals came from his only two shots of the night.",
      "The Argentine is an atypical Manchester City player, low-touch but high-efficiency, and it is that streamlined effectiveness that makes him so important to Pep Guardiola. Alvarez is not the beating heart of this team but he almost always affects games.",
      "It is for that reason that he has become so prominent. In the Premier League so far this season, the 24-year-old is the only Manchester City player to have started all 21 games.",
      "The assumption is that Haaland's return will bump him out of the team. But do not be surprised if Guardiola continues to find room for him. This was just one of many games this season in which he has underlined his importance.Nick Wright",
      "With James Maddison making his first start since November, the England international was all set to grab the headlines, but it was Timo Werner who impressed most in attack.",
      "The German was a constant threat down the left and caused Brentford plenty of problems, grabbing an assist for the second goal.",
      "His eye-catching performance drew praise from Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "\"I thought he was great,\" the Australian said. \"He's a quality player. As he gets stronger and fitter and understands our game a little bit better, I think he'll become even more effective.",
      "\"I know there's goals in him as well and that will come with time.\"",
      "Spurs usually leave their business towards the end of the transfer window but this month they acted early by bringing in Werner on loan, and that swift action is paying off.Declan Olley",
