      "Rasmus Hojlund has voiced his anger on social media following his disallowed goal during Napoli's 2-2 stalemate with Hellas Verona on Wednesday. The Manchester United loanee found the net with a stretched finish, but the strike was overturned after replays appeared to show the ball making contact with his arm during the build-up.",
      "Expressing his disappointment on Instagram, Hojlund posted clips of the controversial moment and commented: \"Didn't even touch the ball with the hand. Well, we go again on Sunday. Forza Napoli sempre,\" accompanied by a blue love heart and prayer emojis.",
      "Following the match, Antonio Conte voiced his exasperation, stating: \"Hojlund's goal was disallowed because I don't know where he should have had that arm. We have to accept them and we accept them.\"",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that referee Simone Sozza and the VAR team have subsequently been suspended, despite the match decisions being 'deemed correct.'",
      "Napoli found themselves trailing 2-0 at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona before Scott McTominay reduced the deficit, with Giovanni Di Lorenzo ultimately salvaging a point in the 82nd minute.",
      "McTominay broke his longest Serie A scoring drought, a nine-match barren spell since arriving at Napoli in 2024, earning him the Man of the Match accolade.",
      "Conte acknowledged his team's underwhelming first-half display, whilst commending their resilience as the match unfolded.",
      "\"In the first half there were two negative episodes for us, we could have done better,\" the Italian manager added. \"On the penalty there was a somewhat peculiar assessment... But we accept it.",
      "\"These two episodes could kill anyone. In the second half we were good at putting our heads on our shoulders.",
      "\"We had the strength to score two goals, and that's what counts.\"",
      "Hojlund has netted six times and provided two assists in 14 Serie A outings this campaign, though he couldn't add to his tally on this occasion after having a goal disallowed.",
      "Napoli possess a €50million (£43.6m) option to make the transfer permanent when the loan concludes, which becomes mandatory if they secure Champions League qualification this season.",
      "Nevertheless, all signs point to Hojlund making the switch permanent irrespective of circumstances.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United supporters' group The 1958 have slammed the club's owners, chief executive Omar Berrarda and director of football Jason Wilcox, calling for a vote of no confidence. The group have announced plans for a protest against the United hierarchy that will take place before their fixture with Fulham on February 1.",
      "The group have criticised the management of Ruben Amorim's spell at Old Trafford, describing on-pitch performances as \"medicore\" and off-field operations as \"chaos\". Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been labelled an \"incompetent clown\" after his unsuccessful attempts to guide the club towards improvement.",
      "Amorim was dismissed by United on Monday, just hours after his furious comments following their 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. Darren Fletcher has assumed control on an interim basis and managed the clash against Burnley, which ended 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round match against Premier League opponents, Brighton.",
      "The protest adds further pressure on the Glazer family, Ratcliffe, and the revamped footballing operations team at the Theatre of Dreams. There is frustration amongst the supporters who believe they have been priced out, sidelined and treated as a nuisance.",
      "Supporters staged a demonstration at the conclusion of last season, ahead of the crucial fixture with Aston Villa, uniting to express their dissatisfaction with the football club following one of their most dismal campaigns in top-flight history",
      "They finished 15th in the Premier League and suffered defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Plans were initially in place to protest United's Premier League curtain-raiser against Arsenal, but these were abandoned following backlash over the decision to target Ratcliffe alongside the Glazers' stewardship of the club.",
      "Having postponed their demonstrations against the INEOS chief, next month's encounter with Marco Silva's outfit will mark the first chance for fans to express their discontent. Statements opposing the board have already started to surface, including during Wednesday's 2-2 stalemate at Turf Moor, where a banner was displayed in the away section declaring: \"Jim can't fix this.\"",
      "United are positioned just beyond the Champions League spots but squandered another chance to secure a top-four berth, with Benjamin Sesko's brace proving insufficient against Scott Parker's team.",
      "Amorim has encountered mounting scrutiny after being unable to reverse the declining form that ultimately resulted in Erik ten Hag's sacking. The former Sporting CP manager has presided over several nadir moments during his spell at the club, including a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two outfit Grimsby.",
      "A representative for The 1958 group expressed their concern, stating: \"It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.",
      "\"A manager has reportedly been dismissed not primarily for abject performances against Grimsby, Everton, West Ham, and Wolves, but allegedly for a heated exchange with Jason Wilcox. Wilcox a man with just nine months' experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar's belief.",
      "\"This decision was allegedly endorsed by Omar Berrada, a CEO with no prior experience in the role, listening to the complaints of a close ally rather than exercising independent leadership. We are once again witnessing Manchester United being run by executives learning on the job, at the expense of results, stability, and credibility.",
      "\"Let us be clear: this is not a defence of Ruben or the football served up under him. Much of it was unacceptable. But his dismissal once again exposes the continued dysfunction at our club. Manchester United is now a toxic partnership where fans are getting the worst of both worlds.",
      "\"WE CALL FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE OWNERSHIP, BERRADA AND WILCOX.\"",
      "They stated: \"Earlier this season, we asked supporters if they wanted to protest. Many chose to give Ratcliffe time. That time has been squandered. The situation is undeniably worse. That is why we will protest at Fulham at home on Sunday 1st February.",
      "\"Manchester United is 150 years old. That proud history, built by generations of supporters, must be protected.",
      "\"If we do not act now, the club we pass on will be unrecognisable, stripped of its culture, its soul, and its people. \"This needs to be stopped. We must fight for our club.",
      "We must fight for fan culture before it is too late. If you knew you couldn't play tomorrow, how hard would you play today?",
      "\"For Ratcliffe and the Glazers the game is over. Time is up. We can take no more and urge as many fans as possible to join us in a massive protest.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko believes ‘great things are coming’ for Manchester United as the Red Devils’ step up their search for a new manager. Ruben Amorim was sacked by club chiefs earlier this week, with former midfielder Darren Fletcher put in temporary charge.",
      "He secured a point in his opening game as United drew 2-2 with Burnley. Club chiefs are are still in the process of trying to find Amorim’s successor, with Fletcher potentially an interim option, while former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also in talks over a return.",
      "But whoever is in charge, Sesko is backing United to recover sooner rather than later due to the spirit in the changing room. Asked if the side has resilience, the Slovenian replied: \"Definitely.",
      "“I think in general we're a really great group. We're doing everything to try prove ourselves every single time.",
      "\"We just have to keep going, keep pushing, because I think we're great and, yeah, I believe that great things are coming.\"",
      "Like United, Sesko has had his issues this season following a £74m switch from RB Leipzig. Ahead of the trip to Turf Moor, he had scored just twice in the Premier League but is now relieved to be back on form.",
      "Speaking about his brace, Sesko added: \"It feels great because we created great chances, especially with those two goals. Great movements, great ball.",
      "\"With this kind of situation, we are showing what team we are, what we are capable of and, yeah, it's great for the future, obviously.\"",
      "And while Sesko is predicting big things for United, he has sent a demand to his teammates to now aim for victories as United attempt to rise from seventh in the Premier League standings.",
      "He said: “It feels obviously disappointing because I think we were fighting, we were giving our best, we were creating a lot of chances. Basically, the ball was two times in the net, like over the line, but the opponent just took it out.",
      "\"We're creating good chances. Unfortunately, we received two goals. We still get a draw, which is important, but now it's just up to us to try to focus on the details and try to win the next game.\"",

      "Former Manchester United defender Laurent Blanc claimed he was approached about taking the reins at Old Trafford in 2014. Rumours are rife over who will succeed Ruben Amorim at United after the Portuguese boss was relieved of his duties this week after a beleaguered tenure.",
      "Blanc is currently out of work after leaving Al-Ittihad in the Saudi Pro League in September of last year. The Frenchman spent two seasons as a player with United from 2001 to 2003, winning the Premier League under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "After retiring, the 1998 World Cup winner ventured into management with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, where he won three Ligue 1 titles, and Bordeaux, where he also won the French top-flight. He also took charge of the French national team.",
      "The bookmakers' latest odds have now positioned Blanc as one of the candidates to take over at United, amongst many others. However, he could have had his chance to manage the club over a decade ago.",
      "The 60-year-old claimed he spoke to United about replacing David Moyes before Louis van Gaal was eventually appointed as manager.",
      "\"I had a call from a director, I'd prefer not to say who, and some discussion,\" Blanc told The Times in 2014, He added: \"But I was in Paris so it was very difficult for me to leave. We kept in touch but they went with Van Gaal in the end.\"",
      "Blanc was reportedly under consideration once more following Jose Mourinho's sacking by United in December 2019. However, United went on to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as caretaker manager, with the Norwegian being given the job on a permanent basis before being sacked himself in November 2021.",
      "While perhaps it's unlikely that Blanc is in the frame for the job this time around he did underline his intentions to one day manage in the Premier League.",
      "\"Managing in England is a big ambition,\" he said in 2014. \"I have big experience at Paris. \"It's difficult for me to go to another club in France. I want a different challenge in England, Spain or Italy. I played in those countries, I know them, so I keep going to games and I see what calls come in.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher has been named as interim boss of United but it's Solskjaer and Carrick who are the hot favourites to take the job on an temporary basis.",
      "Other names tipped for the job and joining Blanc on the long list include Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner. Ex-Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who stepped down as the Blues head coach on New Years' Day, and Barcelona legend Xavi have also been linked to the job.",
      "Amorim was appointed to replace Erik ten Hag as United manager in November 2024. He oversaw a miserable debut campaign with United finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim left the club having won just 24 of his 63 matches in charge. A club statement said \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",

      "Manchester United are gearing up for an FA Cup third-round clash with Brighton as they scour the transfer market for both players and a manager. The Red Devils recently sacked Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge and are relying on Darren Fletcher in the interim.",
      "However, rumours continue to swirl about who the new boss will be, whether that is in the short or long term. The incoming manager will require reinforcements as United aim for a high finish in the Premier League this season.",
      "The club currently sit seventh in the table after a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday evening and have the Manchester derby to contend with in the Premier League next. First up is Brighton in the FA Cup, who held Man City to a 1-1 draw on Monday.",
      "Sam Mather is set to become the first player to leave United this January. The 21-year-old, who is yet to make a senior appearance for the Red Devils, was initially meant to sign for Kayserispor last summer but failed to secure the deal.",
      "Now, reports have surfaced that Mather was spotted at the Turkish club's training facilities, suggesting that a transfer announcement is imminent. Sources in Turkey claim that Kayserispor have agreed terms with United to sign the winger, and that he has already been seen sporting the training kit for his new club.",
      "Mather will sign for an undisclosed fee, joining Kayserispor's training camp in Antalya ahead of their games against Besiktas, Istanbul Basaksehir and Galatasaray. The local academy star was tied down to United until 2027, but sought a transfer elsewhere to boost his senior career.",
      "New reports have suggested that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is open to returning to United on a temporary basis after engaging in talks this week. Fabrizio Romano reports that the ex-United striker is considering another run at Old Trafford, three years after he was sacked as manager in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer is one of several candidates for the interim position, with former midfielder Michael Carrick also being considered a person of interest for the role. Romano claims that \"conversations are going quite well\" but \"timing\" will be key to select the next United boss - albeit on a short-term basis.",
      "Darren Fletcher is currently in charge of the Red Devils and led them to a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday night.

      "It would be easy to dismiss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last job in management with Besiktas as a failure. Being dismissed after eight months, having failed to qualify for either the Europa League or Europa Conference League group stage, doesn't paint a great picture for the man being considered for a return to Manchester United as interim boss.",
      "Yet that doesn't capture the complete picture of Solskjaer's spell in Turkey, according to football journalists Kaan Bayazit and Elnur Kuliev. Solskjaer took charge of a club in turmoil 12 months ago, before guiding them from seventh place to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig.",
      "He delivered a remarkable Europa League victory over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and defeated their fierce city rivals, Galatasaray, to protect an important club record. On the chaos Solskjaer walked into last January, following Giovanni Van Bronckhorst's dismissal, Bayazit, a Besiktas podcaster said: \"It was probably the lowest point I'd seen Besiktas at in my 25 years of following the club. It was a really difficult job.",
      "\"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Bayazit admits that Solskjaer's style of play wasn't aesthetically pleasing, but insists it was necessary given the players at his disposal. He explained: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad.",
      "\"They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Those big matches included a victory over Galatasaray that preserved an important piece of Besiktas history. Kuliev, an Istanbul-based football blogger, said: \"With Solskjaer, Besiktas did actually improve slightly with attack.",
      "\"They did create some more chances and also had some good results occasionally, especially the game against Galatasaray, which prevented them ending the season without losing game. That kept Besiktas as the only side in league to have season without losing single game (1991/92). Players looked more energetic after he joined.\"",
      "However, Solskjaer didn't have enough credit in the bank to survive losing in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League at the start of the season. Bayazit firmly believes Solskjaer didn't deserve to be dismissed, though.",
      "He said: \"I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.",
      "\"I don't think he was sufficiently backed by the president. Two weeks before he sacked him, he said, 'We're backing him.'",
      "Kuliev feels Solskjaer was hindered by a lack of stability at the club. He said: \"There are many issues which went wrong with Besiktas, including building the wrong squad with some imbalance among players. Also, some serious issues in administration led the team to be poorly managed financially.",
      "\"Not being able to qualify for Europe was the catalyst of his sacking but the team generally did start poorly this season and didn't show much improvement.",
      "\"Last season wasn't too much criticised as he did come to a team which had some issues already. But with such issues continuing after summer break, it was clear that the team would have same similar performance with Solskjaer. Taking into account the impatient atmosphere towards results in the Turkish football environment, this [his sacking] shouldn't be seen as a surprise.\"",
      "However, Bayazit believes he represents the ideal short-term solution for United following Ruben Amorim's dismissal. He said: \"I think it would be great for United. He has the ability to bring that team together again.",
      "\"I don't know if he is the person to take them back to their glory days. I said the same about him at Besiktas, that I didn't know if he could get us back to winning trophies. But at the time, he was the best option because he stabilised things and brought joy back to the players.",
      "\"I think Ole should have been given a lot more time at Besiktas; he could have laid the groundwork for future success with stability around him, which he didn't get.",
      "\"I think Ole did well with the pressure. It's regrettable that he got sacked when he did and it sent the club into more chaos.",
      "\"It speaks volumes about what he did in a relative short period of time, because he did bring some stability. For Manchester United, he is a good option because they're not going to get a top manager at the moment.\"",

      "Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers has high praise for Michael Carrick, describing him as a stand-out manager who was fundamental to shaping his early footballing career. Carrick is currently in the running to take temporary charge at Manchester United, alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Reports are gathering pace about the potential return of the two former players and coaches, possibly as part of the same team. It's believed that discussions have taken place, with both Carrick and Solskjaer, in what could be a significant shift for United following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Both coaches have previously worked together at Old Trafford, with Carrick forming part of Solskjaer's coaching staff when he was their manager before. While there are many questions about who might be best suited for the role, Rogers has already given his endorsement of Carrick.",
      "Rogers, a star player at Villa, played under Carrick at Middlesbrough during the 2023/2024 season and emphasises the impact that brief period had on his career.",
      "\"Michael Carrick, he was the coach that spoke to me away from football,\" said Rogers.",
      "\"There was always a line of communication with him which I thought was vital at the time. I still speak to him now.",
      "\"I had a difficult three years going out on loan - before Middlesbrough - but I don't think I'd be the player I am now without the experiences.",
      "\"It gave me the toughness to go through adversity, it also helped me grow up and learn about myself and what I needed to improve. At that time, I wasn't ready.\"",
      "Rogers added: \"Unai [Emery] has obviously been important with the style of play and what he's made me - the confidence he's embedded in me.",
      "\"He's allowed me to be me and really show my skills.\"",
      "Carrick embarked on his managerial journey in 2022 when he was handed the head coach role at Championship side Middlesbrough, following a short caretaker stint with United in 2021.",
      "Despite chalking up 63 victories during his tenure at the Riverside, he couldn't guide the club to promotion and eventually departed in the summer of 2025.",
      "As United mull over their next appointment, Darren Fletcher is currently at the helm on an temporary basis. After Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Burnley, he will be in the dugout for Sunday's FA Cup clash against Brighton (4.30pm).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Darren Fletcher's temporary stint as Manchester United boss is set to extend at least until the weekend, with all attention focused on the FA Cup.",
      "The competition represents the team's last realistic chance of securing a trophy this season, following an early and costly exit from the Carabao Cup at the hands of Grimsby Town, and the challenge of closing the gap in the Premier League.",
      "Whether Fletcher will remain in caretaker charge after the weekend's cup clash with Brighton is uncertain, but he'll be eager to guide the team into the fourth round regardless.",
      "The likes of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have been in talks with the United hierarchy over the role as interim, and could take on the role beyond that.",
      "The current interim backroom staff received a boost midweek with the return of several key players from injury. However, it wasn't enough to secure a win at Burnley, as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor.",
      "These returns could make all the difference for United in the FA Cup, especially given the absence of three key players due to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "So, with that in mind, here's the latest injury and availability update for Fletcher and his backroom team ahead of Man United's FA Cup third round clash with Brighton.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt is the only main injury concern for Man United, as he looks to return from a lower back issue. The centre-back has been out of action since November, with some hope that he could be back soon.",
      "Amad is one of the stars absent due to his involvement at AFCON. He has been in impressive form for the Ivory Coast so far, finding the net three times for them so far.",
      "The Man United ace has a mouth-watering game against Egypt on Saturday evening, with a place in the semi-final up for grabs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has been a key player since his move to Manchester United last summer, so his absence has certainly been felt. The forward has been featuring at AFCON with Cameroon, who take on Morocco on Friday night for a place in the semi-final.",
      "Another absentee due to AFCON is Noussair Mazraoui, who is with the host nation, Morocco. The 28-year-old will take on Mbeumo and Cameroon in Friday's match, with only one able to make it into the final four of the competition.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made an early return from injury in midweek, as he was available to start against Burnley. It remains to be seen whether he is fit enough to start against Brighton in the cup, having played an hour in the match before he was substituted.",
      "Another welcome injury return followed for Kobbie Mainoo, who came off the bench in the trip at Burnley. The academy graduate played the final 15 minutes of the match, as he looks to put himself up for contention to start again.",
      "Harry Maguire was named on the bench for Man United's trip to Burnley in midweek. He has struggled with a thigh injury since November, but he is yet to play any minutes and his availability for the weekend is uncertain."

Mourinho's side were beaten 3-1 on home soil in the Portuguese League Cup, with the defeat coming amid reports that club chiefs are eyeing freshly-axed Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim to take over.",

      "In his post-match press conference, Mourinho revealed that his players will be sleeping at the club's training ground in Seixal for the next few days. Benfica had planned to stay there in order to prepare for what would've been a final against Vitoria on Saturday.",
      "\"Thinking we'd be playing the final, we're not going home, we're going to Seixal,\" Mourinho fumed. \"The players will sleep in Seixal, and tomorrow there's training, and the day after tomorrow there's training.",

      "Presenter Richard Keys is adamant Manchester United will wait until summer to appoint a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim as their top target is Thomas Tuchel. The current England has also already been named by club legend Paul Scholes as his first choice for the role.",
      "United quickly fired Amorim on Monday morning following an outburst about the club and his position following his side's draw with Leeds United the day before. An immediate succession plan involved putting former midfielder Darren Fletcher in caretaker charge before a decision is made on an interim coach to see out the remainder of the 2025/26 season.",
      "As things stand that looks set to be between two more former United Premier League winners - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick.",
      "But whoever is picked as interim coach will not be kept on permanently no matter their achievements between now and May, theorises Keys, who explained to beIN SPORTS how United have already come to a decision over their next manager.",
      "\"I believe the one they really want is Tuchel and they'll wait. Maybe Tuchel walks away from a World Cup win with England in the summer, and then they'll look like they're very smart. Tuchel, or whoever goes in there has got to say, 'Look, enough! Enough!'\"",
      "The pundit was challenged by ex-United striker Dwight Yorke. He questioned the statement by asking whether United would still want Tuchel to come if he isn't successful with England at the showpiece tournament.",
      "Keys responded: \"That's not my problem. They do!\"",
      "The latest step in Tuchel's 18-year managerial career has been to take over the England national team in January 2025. He has since managed a near-perfect record with nine wins out of 10 matches played, including eight World Cup qualifying wins with 22 goals scored and zero conceded.",
      "The Three Lions are entered into the 2026 major tournament with group stage fixtures drawn. They will face Croatia, Ghana and Panama.",

      "This is what has prompted United legend Scholes to name Tuchel as his ideal candidate for the Old Trafford job this week. On The Good, The Bad And The Football podcast, the former midfielder stated: \"Number one for me, which I’d do in the summer, is Thomas Tuchel all day long.",
      "\"I think Tuchel is one of the very best out there. His contract with England is only until the summer. I think he can be a bit temperamental and he can be difficult to handle, but he’s done it at big clubs.",
      "\"He’s turned England around as well… England do look a lot better under him. His football is very possession based, and a little Man City. That’s my only reservation.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes' leadership qualities were evident in the aftermath of Manchester United's draw against Burnley. Even former teammate Hannibal Mejbri wasn't exempt from the midfielder's watchful eye as he tried to provoke Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Despite the result not going in favour of Darren Fletcher in his debut match as caretaker coach, there were some positive aspects from the visit to Turf Moor. Ugarte was given a starting position alongside Casemiro in midfield and delivered one of his best performances of the season so far.",
      "His precise pass to Patrick Dorgu ultimately led to Benjamin Sesko's second goal of the match for United to take their only lead. Ugarte displayed energy throughout his 84-minute stint before being substituted for the more offensive Shea Lacey.",
      "Throughout the game, Ugarte had an ongoing feud with Mejbri, a product of United's academy who left the club in 2024. The situation threatened to escalate when Mejbri tried to get under Ugarte's skin just after the final whistle.",
      "The Tunisia international appeared to be invading Ugarte's personal space, presumably in an attempt to intimidate him. However, footage captured by fans showed Fernandes stepping in to defuse the situation, pushing Mejbri away from his teammate.",
      "United's captain cast a stern glance at his former comrade as he guided Ugarte towards the tunnel, maintaining a firm hand on his shoulder the entire time. Lisandro Martinez also expressed his disapproval and seemed to deliver a more verbal rebuke to Mejbri as the two groups separated.",
      "Earlier in the match, Ugarte had mockingly patted Mejbri on the back after he received a yellow card for diving. From that angle, it's understandable why he'd be keen to celebrate after Burnley emerged as the happier side following the draw.",
      "The 22-year-old has long been regarded as something of a fiery character on the pitch. There were once expectations he'd become the backbone of United's midfield before his transfer to Burnley 18 months ago for an initial sum of around £5.5million.",
      "As for Fernandes, the Portugal international was substituted on the hour mark for Mason Mount. Fernandes had only just recovered from a rare 17-day spell on the sidelines due to a hamstring problem, and United legend Fletcher confirmed this had always been the intention.",
      "\"I didn't want to take Bruno Fernandes off in that game,\" said the caretaker manager after the match. \"But that was the plan from the club, from the medical [staff], from the coaches.",
      "\"Bruno had an injury, that we have to respect, and it's a long season as well. So, it's disappointing, but that was the plan before the game and we knew that was going to happen.\"",

      "Solskjaer had a near three-year spell as the club's head coach before being given his marching orders. But in light of Ruben Amorim's sacking on Monday morning the hierarchy are now looking to find someone to steer the team through until the end of the season.",
      "Their former boss, as well as Michael Carrick, are the two men being tipped to take on the role. The possibility exists of them working together and Norwegian outlet Nettavisen claims that Solskjaer is set to be paid between £50,000-£60,000 per week should he be given the role.",
      "If he worked until the end of May that would land him a seven figure sum whilst a lucrative bonus is also on the table. United are two points outside the top four and Solskjaer could receive between £3m-£4m if he secures them a spot in the Champions League.",
      "The Red Devils missed out last term as Amorim posted the team's worst ever finish in the Premier League era, ending in 15th. This season has been mixed but, even though the Portuguese head coach was axed, he left them within touching distance of European football.",
      "In his two full seasons at the helm, Solskjaer delivered top four finishes. He led the team to third in 2020 and then went one better the following year. He remains one of only two men to secure a runners-up finish since the days of Sir Alex Ferguson. Jose Mourinho the other.",
      "The Norwegian has admitted since his exit from Manchester that he would jump at the chance to return if the opportunity ever arose. Now, with the club seeking a stop gap until they eye a permanent manager in the summer, Solskjaer could be afforded the chance to head back to his former home.",
      "Gary Neville played alongside him for years at Old Trafford and has expressed concern with the club's direction. He said: \"You almost go through cycles whereby, and United have done this for 12 years now. They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge ten years ago, then Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] took charge and you go back to the old boys. Then you go for a new one, then you go for one more - it's almost like a cycle and a movie that we've all seen before and Groundhog Day.",
      "On Solskjaer, he then added: \"They get the club. But still they're going to come under a lot of pressure in the next four or five months if results don't go their way. So look, they have to be ready for that... Whoever's going to get it, out of those three that are being mentioned, I wish them all the best because it's a tough role.\"",

      "Under Amorim this term, Mainoo didn't make a single Premier League starting appearance and was blocked from going out on loan during the summer months. The midfielder was reportedly keen on a temporary move away this month, as well, but now has a chance to revive his fortunes in Manchester.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder made his return from a calf problem as a substitute in United's stalemate with Burnley under Darren Fletcher. This term, Mainoo has accumulated just 318 minutes of action for the club.",
      "Owen suggests the youngster needs to step up under Amorim's successor. The former United forward thinks this could prove a pivotal juncture in Mainoo's career.",
      "\"By the very fact that Amorim has gone, you'd think that he's going to get a lot more opportunity to play, but it's where the positive for him ends in many ways,\" Owen told Metro.",
      "\"Now it's down to Mainoo. It's all right blaming people, but of course, his time is now going to come, and so he's got to take it.",
      "\"He's got to take that opportunity because if the next manager doesn't play him - and the next manager doesn't bring him on much - then at some point, a little bit like Marcus Rashford, those doubts may well start to creep in.",
      "\"He'll be thinking; 'Am I playing well? Am I listening to all the information I'm getting? Am I disciplined? Am I all of these things?'.",

      "\"He's got to now prove Amorim was wrong by not playing him. He's probably going to get that opportunity, so we'll see.\"",
      "Despite ongoing transfer window speculation, Mainoo is expected to stay put at Old Trafford. Given his relatively low wages as an academy graduate, a loan would offer little financial benefit, and would mean losing his services.",
      "Mainoo's contract with United runs until 2027, with an option for an additional 12 months. It's understood that the England international declined a contract extension last year.",
      "Last month, now-former head coach Amorim hinted that Mainoo remains a key part of United's future plans. \"He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days,\" the Portuguese said.",

      "Since departing Old Trafford after a fallout with the now-dismissed Ruben Amorim, Rashford has been settling in well with the Catalan giants. However, recently he's been struggling to secure regular playing time.",
      "He was notably absent from the starting eleven during their recent trip to Villarreal and despite being reinstated against rivals Espanyol, his performance had little impact, leading to him being benched for the Super Cup semi-final against Athletic Club. The game was staged in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Barcelona comfortably defeated their opponents 5-0 on Wednesday evening, with Rashford replacing Raphinha in the 64th minute. However, his brief appearance failed to impress the Spanish media, who were more taken aback by the performance of the player he's vying for game time with.",
      "Rashford did see a fair amount of action when he came on, but Barcelona had already established a five-goal lead before the hour mark.",
      "Mundo Deportivo felt that despite his efforts to make an impact, Rashford wasn't quite up to scratch out wide. They commented: \"He couldn't find his rhythm in a game that was already decided.\"",
      "It was Raphinha, deployed on the left flank where Rashford had hoped to feature, who truly captivated spectators. Mundo Deportivo praised his contribution to the emphatic 5-0 victory, in which he netted twice.",
      "\"A fantastic performance on par with last season's, now fully fit after the injury that sidelined him,\" they wrote. \"He was a constant threat down the left flank, both in his pressing and his runs into space.\"",
      "Rashford received a somewhat less harsh assessment from AS, who noted: \"He came on with the game already decided and with the possibility of finding space. Though he couldn't take advantage of such a favourable situation.\"",
      "However, a concerning development for Rashford is just how impressive Raphinha appears to be in that role. Manager Hansi Flick attempted to accommodate both the England international and Raphinha in the victory over Espanyol, but the approach seemed ineffective.",
      "The cup performance proved far more successful, with Raphinha excelling. This doesn't suggest a positive outlook for Rashford's prospects, with AS adding: \"Flick opted against experimenting in the Super Cup semi-final, placing Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "\"This marked a return to normalcy after the German coach, in his attempt to fit Rashford into the starting eleven, played the Brazilian centrally in the derby against Espanyol. That experiment proved unsuccessful.\"",
      "Marca touched upon several of Rashford's key moments during the match, offering a more positive assessment of his time off the bench. Describing one particular contribution, they noted: \"Rashford controlled the ball magically but lacked the speed to finish.\"",
      "He received a 6/10 rating for the evening, with Marca commenting: \"The England international came on in the 64th minute, replacing Raphinha on the left wing. He was willing and created danger.\"",
      "However, it was Raphinha, who secured fifth place in last year's Ballon d'Or rankings, whom they believed delivered a far superior performance on the left flank, the very position where Rashford hopes to secure game time, as he did earlier in the campaign when the Brazilian was sidelined through injury.",
      "They observed: \"The former Leeds winger returns to his position on the left flank. Against Espanyol, he played in the attacking midfield role but he isn't as comfortable in that position. His performances are better when he plays on the wing: today's match is a prime example.\"",
      "In contrast to other outlets, Sport offered a slightly more generous appraisal of Rashford's showing. They awarded him a 7/10 and wrote: \"The Englishman came out, as always, eager. He attempted a couple of diagonal runs when the game had already slowed down considerably.\"",
      "Nevertheless, they also highlighted Raphinha's impressive display, contributing to a worrying assessment that could mean extended spells on the substitutes' bench for the United loanee. They gave Raphinha a 9/10 rating and stated: \"It's a spectacle to watch him attack the spaces. He adds an extra level of intensity to everything. Absolutely essential.\"",

      "JJ Gabriel could make his debut for Manchester United this weekend aged just 15. The Red Devils welcome Brighton to Old Trafford on Sunday for an FA Cup third round tie.",
      "Darren Fletcher will remain in his post as the club's caretaker manager for the game. The former United midfielder was put in charge after the sacking of Ruben Amorim was announced on Monday morning.",
      "Fletcher oversaw Wednesday night's 2-2 draw at Burnley, as United came from behind before ultimately squandering their second-half lead to make it three games without a win. The Scot showed his willingness to trust youngsters by bringing on Shea Lacey, who hit the crossbar and came close with another long-range effort in the closing stages.",
      "Now Gabriel is next in line. The Mail report that United's latest wonderkid will be in and around first-team training this week, as he was on Monday when Fletcher, helped by Travis Binnion and Alan Wright, took the session.",
      "Fletcher knows Gabriel, whose full name is Joseph Junior Andreou Gabriel, from coaching the Red Devils' under-18 side, his usual role. The forward has scored an impressive 10 goals in 13 games in the U18 Premier League this season.",
      "Gabriel has already scored at Old Trafford, netting the only goal as United beat Peterborough in the FA Youth Cup last month. It made him the club's youngest ever scorer in the competition.",
      "His style of play has been compared to Brazilian icon Neymar. In June, United showed their faith in the England under-16 international by handing him a two-year deal, with director of football Jason Wilcox playing a role in negotiations.",
      "That's because Gabriel celebrated his 15th birthday on October 6. League rules only allow 15-year-olds to play if they've turned 15 by August 31 of the relevant campaign. In the FA Cup, however, he's eligible.",
      "United are currently light on forwards, with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both at the Africa Cup of Nations, and Joshua Zirkzee linked with a move away. Lacey may well get minutes again, as the Red Devils begin what they hope is their road to Wembley. The FA Cup represents their only realistic chance of lifting silverware this term.",

      "Manchester United’s next managerial appointment could have huge ramifications for Mason Greenwood’s future. Since the sacking of head coach Ruben Amorim earlier this week, a host of names have been linked with the role at Old Trafford.",
      "Darren Fletcher, a club legend, is currently acting as manager on a temporary basis, with his first match in charge ending in a 2-2 draw against Burnley on Wednesday.",
      "Among the lengthy list of long-term candidates for the position is current Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi, according to The Athletic, which claims he is currently under consideration.",
      "The Italian has previous Premier League experience thanks to his tenure at Brighton from September 2022 to June 2024, when his contract was terminated reportedly due to disagreements with the club's recruitment strategy.",
      "De Zerbi has since made waves at Marseille, guiding them to Champions League qualification. In 2024, he was reportedly interviewed by United as they sought alternatives to Erik ten Hag, highlighting long-standing admiration for his methods, before eventually appointing Amorim.",
      "One of De Zerbi's key players at Marseille is former United academy product and first-team star, Greenwood. De Zerbi brought Greenwood, now 24, to Marseille in the summer of 2024.",
      "United parted ways with Greenwood following his suspension by the club in January 2022 amid allegations of attempted rape, assault and controlling and coercive behaviour. Greenwood denied all charges.",
      "All charges were subsequently dropped and the forward secured a loan move to Getafe on deadline day in the summer of 2023. Greenwood is currently enjoying the best form of his career at Marseille, having netted 15 goals in 23 appearances across all competitions this season, following a 22 goal haul last term.",
      "However, his future at the club could be thrown into uncertainty if United show serious interest in De Zerbi. The Ligue 1 top scorer has already been linked with a move away in recent months, with Napoli, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and two unnamed Premier League clubs reportedly keen on snapping him up.",
      "If De Zerbi ends up becoming United's 12th manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, Greenwood might well follow his boss out of the door.",
      "Other names that have been linked with the United job include Gareth Southgate, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Kieran McKenna, Xavi, Zinedine Zidane, Oliver Glasner and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with the latter being touted as a potential interim candidate.",

Mather is said to have signed for an undisclosed fee, joining Kayserispor's training camp in Antalya ahead of their games against Besiktas, Istanbul Basaksehir and Galatasaray.",
      "Mather has been eager to kick-start his professional career, in turn prompting him to leave his boyhood club in search of a fresh challenge and regular minutes.",

      "A Manchester United return for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not proving universally popular, with even Gary Neville claiming the club are going round in circles by eyeing up a former player.",
      "The Norwegian is poised to return in some capacity more than four years after he was axed as manager. Michael Carrick, another ex-player who was one of Solskjaer's assistants, is also being tipped for a return.",
      "Solskjaer is one of only two men to deliver second-place finishes for United in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but his tenure was not without its criticism and ended in horrific fashion following a poor losing run.",
      "The Manchester outfit sacked Ruben Amorim on Monday morning and their succession plan involved putting Darren Fletcher in caretaker charge before hiring an interim until the end of the season. As things stand that looks set to be Solskjaer, Carrick or the two men working in tandem.",
      "Neville, though, feels like the club have been down this path before and need to break the cycle, as he warned his former team-mates that the heat will come if they endure poor results from now until the end of the season.",
      "He said: \"You almost go through cycles whereby, and United have done this for 12 years now. They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge ten years ago, then Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] took charge and you go back to the old boys. Then you go for a new one, then you go for one more - it's almost like a cycle and a movie that we've all seen before and Groundhog Day.",
      "Name checking Solskjaer and Carrick he then added: \"They get the club. But still they're going to come under a lot of pressure in the next four or five months if results don't go their way. So look, they have to be ready for that... Whoever's going to get it, out of those three that are being mentioned, I wish them all the best because it's a tough role.\"",
      "Danny Murphy has taken a far harder line, claiming it is \"crazy\" that United would consider hiring someone who they got rid of in light of five losses in seven - which included a 5-0 reverse to Liverpool at Old Trafford.",
      "The Match of the Day pundit and ex-Liverpool midfielder said: \"Well the Solskjaer one coming back is crazy. I mean Man United paid him to leave because he ultimately failed and now they're going to pay him to come back? I mean it seems ridiculous when you've got options like Michael Carrick, Fletch obviously is a decent coach and then you've got someone like [Roy] Keane, who the fans would love to come back. Ok, some people might think that might be chaotic but he's a leader.\"",
      "Former Premier League striker Gabby Agbonlahor also cited how relieved many in Manchester were when Solskjaer got the chop in 2021. He told TalkSport: “It's embarrassing. When I saw the news that Solskjaer might be coming back… it's a laughing stock of a football club. The Manchester United fans were relieved when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got sacked. We've got receipts.\"",

      "Casemiro was a straggler when Manchester United arrived at Turf Moor. He was detached at the back of the group as the players entered the ground, and he was off the pace throughout the game.",
      "The Brazilian delivered the kind of performance that proves why United must allow him to leave this summer and resist the temptation to extend his deal after a decent run of form at the start of the campaign.",
      "Casemiro was a passenger for both Burnley goals. The 33-year-old looked like he should have been playing walking football, rooted to the ground as Burnley passed around him.",
      "\"We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again,\" explained Darren Fletcher during his post-match press conference. Casemiro was part of the problem in Lancashire.",
      "In mid-November, United had conceded just five goals when he had been on the pitch, and 15 when he had been off it, but it was always going to be impossible for Casemiro to sustain that level of form.",
      "Casemiro will celebrate his 34th birthday next month. He deserves huge credit for even creating a conversation about whether to extend his deal when it should have been cut and dry, but the decision on his future is obvious: United must cut ties with Casemiro and bid him farewell at the end of the season.",
      "United have the option to extend Casemiro's contract by 12 months, which some have suggested makes sense, however, that would mean he would continue to be the highest earner in the dressing room. It would be an Ed Woodward-esque decision to extend Casemiro's deal, although the events of the last week show Ineos' leadership has more in common with their predecessors than they would admit.",
      "You wouldn't put it past United's hierarchy to make that decision, but they will allow Casemiro to run down his contract if they have any sense. Ruben Amorim's sacking may also influence the decision.",
      "Amorim was an advocate of Casemiro after initially overlooking him following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon. Last month, Amorim was asked whether there was an update on the contracts of Casemiro and Harry Maguire, and he said: \"No, there is no decision, we have a lot to do.",
      "\"We need to understand what is going to happen in the next season because we need to understand there are European games, and what we are doing. So we have so much to do at this moment. We are not thinking about that. We will just think about the next game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he would like to keep both players for next season and responded: \"I'm really happy with them, but I don't know what is going to happen, so we will see what will happen until the end of the season, what position we will be, and then we will see.\"",
      "Discussing whether the uncertainty could impact Casemiro's form, Amorim said: \"It's not that situation, I'm not saying whether he is staying or not. Then when I see Casemiro training, if everyone trained like him, if everyone is so focused on the detail, even in set-piece training.",
      "\"Even when they are playing 10 versus the goalkeeper and the movement that he makes. Imagine in the game, we will be a top team. If everybody works like Casemiro. And when I say work, it's not just about the running, it's the focus, and you can understand why that guy won five Champions Leagues.",
      "\"If you pay attention to everything that he does, with contract or with no contract, he's a top player.\"",
      "Amorim spoke warmly about Casemiro's work ethic and quality, to the extent that he gave the impression that the midfielder's deal could be extended under certain conditions.",
      "Casemiro lost a major ally when United announced Amorim's sacking at the beginning of the week, although he was not one of the players who thanked Amorim on social media when his exit was confirmed. The former Real Madrid midfielder posted \"we fought but couldn't get the first win of the year\" to his 22 million followers on Instagram after drawing with Leeds last weekend.",
      "United sources believe Amorim intentionally orchestrated his sacking during that post-match press conference. Casemiro wouldn't have been pleased to see a manager who trusted him walking out the door.",
      "Casemiro will also be out the exit door in a few months, provided United make the right decision.",

      "Ruben Amorim's departure as United head coach was confirmed on Monday, with the Reds now looking to appoint a successor in the near future.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been working as United's interim manager in recent days, and recently oversaw the 2-2 draw with Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday night.",
      "Former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has already been linked with a return to Old Trafford, with speculation that an appointment would be a caretaker role until the end of the season.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has also been linked with being appointed as United's next permanent manager, while there has also been a claim made regarding the future of former Inter Milan boss and currently Al-Hilal manager Simone Inzaghi.",
      "Stay here for all of the latest throughout the day around the appointment of a new manager.",
      "Aston Villa star Morgan Rogers speaks very fondly of Michael Carrick, describing him as a manager who stood out during the early stages of his career. Carrick is one of the contenders to take interim charge at Manchester United, alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Both coaches previously worked together at Old Trafford, with Carrick forming part of Solskjaer's backroom team. While there are plenty of questions about who might be best suited for the role, Rogers has already given his own verdict on Carrick.",
      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure.",
      "Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss. But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed by a club in crisis one year ago, before lifting them from seventh to a fourth-place finish in the Super Lig. He pulled off a memorable Europa League win over Athletic Bilbao in his first match and beat their arch city rivals, Galatasaray, to retain a proud club milestone.",
      "Manchester United are preparing for an FA Cup third-round match against Brighton while simultaneously searching the transfer market for new players and a manager. The Red Devils recently parted ways with Ruben Amorim after 14 months in charge, with Darren Fletcher stepping in as caretaker manager.",
      "Speculation continues to circulate about who will take over the managerial reins, whether on a temporary or permanent basis. The incoming boss will undoubtedly need to bolster the squad as United strive for a top finish in the Premier League this season.",
      "Currently positioned seventh in the league following a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday evening, United's next challenge is the Manchester derby in the Premier League. However, their immediate focus is on Brighton in the FA Cup, a team that managed a 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Monday.",
      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "Darren Fletcher will be back in the dugout for Manchester United on Sunday, when they play host Brighton and Hove Albion in the FA Cup third round.",
      "It comes as the club continue their search to appoint a new head coach following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Man United winger Patrick Dorgu has insisted that Amorim was wrong to claim he had been playing nervously.",
      "\"I don’t think those were the words he was looking for,\" he said. \"But I don’t agree that I’ve been nervous.",
      "\"But I do agree that I haven’t played as well as I have with the national team. I haven’t been lying at home and being angry that he has criticised me.\"",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Tottenham are interested in 46‑year‑old Italian manager Roberto De Zerbi, though he is believed to favour a move to Man United instead.",
      "It is said that De Zerbi views the Manchester United job as a 'dream opportunity' to manage the club.

      "Scott McTominay's prospects of returning to Man United could be enhanced if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reinstated as manager. The club legend is rumoured to be in line for a potential comeback as interim boss following the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday.",
      "Speculation suggests it's a toss-up between Solskjaer and Michael Carrick to temporarily helm the club for the remainder of this season. It might be overly optimistic to expect a deal of McTominay's scale to be finalised this month, however, despite the pressing need for dynamism in midfield.",
      "In a 2019 assessment of the player, the Norwegian said: \"He's been excellent, and now that him and Fred work in a good relationship, work well together [sic] did that last season, PSG, when we had a few injuries and now as well they are working as a pair. Scotty's a leader, a Manchester United boy, you can see he's been a striker with the goal at Norwich on a half turn, but he's developing into a very good midfielder.\"",
      "McTominay's debut campaign in Italy read like something from a fairy tale, transforming from Old Trafford outcast to Serie A's Most Valuable Player in less than 12 months.",
      "To a casual observer, it would be easy to cast Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's last foray into management with Besiktas as a failure. Sacked after just eight months in charge after failing to qualify for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League doesn't look great on paper for the man in contention to return to Manchester United as interim boss.",
      "But that doesn't tell the full story of Solskjaer's time in Turkey, according to football journalist and Besiktas podcaster Kaan Bayazit. \"It was seen as impossible to win his first game against Athletic Club [Bilbao], who were on a really good run in La Liga and top of the Europa League table. But they played the best football they had played all season and deservedly won 4-1. The start was very positive and got the players on the same page.\"",
      "Bayazit admits Solskjaer's style of play wasn't easy on the eye but it was case of needs must at the time. He said: \"It wasn't great. That was largely due to the limitations of the squad. The football was, at times, decent but never scintillating to watch. They only had one true winger. Right after Ole got sacked, they did bring in wingers but he never got to work with those players and I think that's the main reason for the team not being fluid under him.",
      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games. I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs. I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.\"",

      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "After his final game in charge at Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was offering a more nuanced view of the only natural striker in his squad, but the bare facts said it all: Sesko had just two goals in 17 appearances under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He doubled that tally in 90 minutes under Darren Fletcher. Jason Wilcox looked sheepish in the stands all night, with his own role as director of football in the spotlight, but this was a good night for those who backed the decision to sign Sesko over Watkins.",
      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",
      "He highlighted his movement and reassured him that he was on the right path. A day later he scored twice after making the right runs and getting on the same wavelength as his teammates.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher. \"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well.",
      "\"Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities. I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"He had a few other opportunities there, another snapshot. It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive from the night really is his two goals.\"",

      "Manchester United insiders have questioned the mentality of the dressing room this season because points have often been dropped from winning positions in the Premier League. United conceded first against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night, but they fought back to lead in the second half after a Benjamin Sesko brace.",
      "Just six minutes after Sesko fired United into the lead, Burnley forward Jaidon Anthony found the back of the net to ensure the points were shared. Only West Ham, Chelsea and Bournemouth have dropped more points from winning positions than United this season. The Reds have lost a total of 14 points from winning positions.",
      "It's understood that United insiders have questioned the mentality of the players, who have often failed to demonstrate the know-how to see out a victory after taking the lead this term. United insiders believe they should have won against Burnley, which Darren Fletcher admitted when he spoke about dropping points during his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It's a good question,\" he said. \"My experience is only tonight, so I experienced that. We get 2-1 up and then I felt we were a bit passive again. We sat in a little bit and maybe we should have gone for the kill and gone for the third goal.",
      "\"It all happened very quickly as well, so I've not had chance to reflect on that yet. So that's something that we'll try and look at, but it's a little bit new just now. It's a little bit fresh, so it's probably going to take a little bit of time to sit back and reflect on the game, watch it back and then try and figure out why these things keep happening.\"",
      "Fletcher added: \"I think you can get in that cycle with a little bit of confidence. I think in terms of like, there's a little bit of a feeling that can you see the game out or can you go on and win it and that's not deemed to be there yet.",
      "\"And that can only build through time and confidence and actually winning some football games and finding out what it takes to win games. Sometimes you might put in a good performance but you've got to find a way to win ugly and see out a match and it might not be pretty.",
      "\"That may be from keeping the ball, that may be from defending deep as a team, whatever that is. But the team need to figure out how to put in performances that win them games and then hopefully from there that confidence can grow.\"",

      "Manchester United drew 2-2 with Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday. Burnley drew first blood at Turf Moor, taking the lead thanks to a deflected strike which was marked as an own-goal from Ayden Heaven.",
      "Darren Fletcher did not look pleased, but United came out swinging at the start of the second half, and Benjamin Sesko scored twice in relatively quick succession to make it 2-1. However, Burnley drew level thanks to a great strike from Jaidon Anthony, which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "The anti-Ratcliffe banner",
      "A banner reading 'Jim can't fix this' was unfurled before the game, implying Sir Jim Ratcliffe doesn't have what it takes to turn the club around. The banner was in response to a tumultuous week, which saw Ruben Amorim sacked, Fletcher hired as interim boss, and talks opened with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer over a possible return.",
      "Ratcliffe bemoaned the mistakes of the previous regime when he took control of football operations at Old Trafford, but the Ineos team have created a mess themselves. Omar Berrada oversaw the appointment of Amorim, a coach wedded to playing with five at the back, and Jason Wilcox interfered with the team's tactics, which is a red flag from a director of football.",
      "United sources insisted there had been no power struggle when Amorim's sacking was confirmed, but it was impossible to pull the wool over fans' eyes following his final press conference. Berrada and Wilcox were at Turf Moor and they were both spotted shaking their heads when Burnley opened the scoring. United fans have been shaking their heads at the pair in the last few days.",
      "Thumbs up for Sesko",
      "Sesko was unfortunate not to score in the first half when he sent an outstanding header goal-bound from the edge of the box. The header had to be perfect to have a chance of going in from that distance - and Sesko was just denied by a beautiful save from former United loanee Martin Dubravka.",
      "The Slovenia international looked in the mood from the first whistle, a stark contrast to last weekend against Leeds, and he received a big thumbs up from Fletcher when he equalised - the interim boss clearly knows how crucial Sesko could be in United's push for a European spot. Sesko's second goal was even better. The cross into the box was wonderful, but he still had plenty to do and finished with the kind of ruthlessness that fans doubted he had in his locker.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was responsible for the assist and sprinted to Sesko, who had a huge smile on his face as his teammates celebrated with him. Just last week, Sesko's teammates had their hands on their heads as he sent a potential match-winner wide of the post in the final 20 minutes against Leeds.",
      "Sesko scored as many Premier League goals against Burnley as he'd managed in his first four months in Manchester. Everyone is hoping Sesko's brace in Lancashire signals the beginning of a purple patch.",
      "Huge cheer for Lacey",
      "There was a huge cheer from the away section when Fletcher introduced Shea Lacey for Manuel Ugarte for the final seven minutes of the game. Amorim frustrated fans by regularly bringing on centre-backs in the closing stages of matches, so it was refreshing to see an attacking substitution instead.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his debut at Villa Park last month. The 18-year-old's first appearance could have come sooner, though, as he'd been knocking on the door for months before his senior bow.",
      "Lacey showed what he can do when smacking the crossbar from the edge of the box just minutes after coming on at Turf Moor. The attacking change from Fletcher was inches away from being a masterstroke.",
      "Fletcher's classy arrival",
      "Fletcher arrived at Turf Moor dressed in a Paul Smith club suit, continuing the trend of former United players-turned caretaker managers wearing a suit and tie on the touchline. The outfit choice comes from playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, who believed United representatives should dress smartly.",
      "The 41-year-old asked Ferguson for his 'blessing' to manage United against Burnley, and he carried himself with class at the pre-match press conference, shaking the hands of journalists.

      "Solskjaer and Carrick chants",

      "When Darren Fletcher was announced as the interim head coach of Manchester United, there was an immediate expectation that the Scot would make changes when he took charge of the Reds for the trip to Burnley. The first expected change was confirmed in his team selection as the Reds reverted to a back four.",
      "Changing their defensive shape was almost a guarantee considering the issues raised with Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back system. Amorim's most fatal failing was persisting with his preferred formation when all the signs showed it couldn't be done with the players available.",
      "After a 2-2 draw to struggling Burnley, the jury remains firmly out on whether the back four will make United noticeably better in the long term. However, another change Fletcher made has brought about instant results for the Reds.",
      "Since the summer, Bruno Fernandes has been playing deeper in midfield to make room for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in the No.10 roles.",
      "\"I think it's a position that I want Bruno more deep, to have more possession, to try to control the game more - and we're doing that,\" Amorim said in September before admitting: \"Sometimes we miss a little bit Bruno in front, maybe because Matheus Cunha was not there.",
      "\"But if Cunha is there, we have one extra player. So I'm trying just to balance the team and trying to imagine the game, and we'll try to put the best starting line-up there.\"",
      "As Amorim explained, even in the deeper role Fernandes was still influential for the Reds, but there was always the feeling he could offer more if played further forward. In his first game in charge, Fletcher scrapped the Fernandes experiment and put him back into attacking midfield.",
      "Fernandes will always play wherever the manager wants him, but United fans have been crying out for him to play more advanced and despite only just coming back from injury this week, the captain showed why this is a better option for United. Within five minutes of the restart, the 31-year-old produced a sublime through ball for Benjamin Sesko to finish.",
      "Due to his minutes being managed, Fernandes only lasted another ten minutes before being substituted but the promising signs are there. United look a better team when Fernandes is playing behind the striker and considering he scored 19 goals from this role last season, moving him further up the pitch makes sense.",
      "This decision is not just better for Fernandes, it also improves the United squad as a whole. When everyone is back fit and available, Mbeumo can play off the right in a 4-2-3-1 system with Cunha cutting in from the left and Fernandes down the middle.",
      "Those wishing to see more of Kobbie Mainoo will also be pleased. With Fernandes pushed further up-field, Mainoo could slot alongside Casemiro to provide a stronger central midfield partnership. A change to Fernandes' role is best for United, his teammates and the captain.",
      "Fernandes has still been influential in midfield this season, but United look a better team when he's played further forward.",

      "Benjamin Sesko's second-half brace put United ahead, though, and just as it looked as though the hosts were heading for yet another defeat, Jaidon Anthony equalised. That made it a frustrating night for interim United boss Darren Fletcher, who ditched Ruben Amorim's formation - including three central defenders and wing-backs - and saw his side carve out numerous chances.",

      "\"He was adamant about the fact that he needed wingers but never got the chance. I think he got the most out of the players for the most part, especially in the big games.\"",
      "Those big games included a win over Galatasaray that preserved a piece of Besiktas history. Bayazit said: \"He's the first manager to win all three big domestic matches in a single half of a season since Besiktas won the league in 2021.",
      "\"He beat Fenerbahçe, Trabzonspor and Galatasray. It was Galatasaray's only loss of the season, which was very significant for Besiktas because they're the only 'Invincibles' in Turkish football history, so beating them was very important.\"",
      "However, Solskjaer still didn't have enough credit in the bank to survive losing in the play-off rounds of both the Europa League and Europa Conference League at the start of the season. Bayazit is adamant Solskjaer didn't deserve the sack and that he was a victim of a president who caved to media pressure.",
      "\"I would say he did a great job, even though his tenure had its ups and downs,\" he said. \"I don't think he should have got sacked when he did. I think he did a very good job with the tools he was handed. He had his legs cut from under him by a president who doesn't have the backbone to resist some media pressure.",
      "\"I don't think he was sufficiently backed by the president. Two weeks before he sacked him, he said, 'We're backing him.' The president has a tenure for three years, then he has to get re-elected, so there is a lot of pressure on them for instant success.",
      "\"But Ole definitely wasn't backed and I would say the Turkish media really had it out for him. Despite the fact he is a model professional and a gentleman, he doesn't leak stuff to the media. He didn't give the media breadcrumbs.\"",
      "Bayazit saw enough of Solskjaer at Besiktas to suggest he is the right short-term option for United following Ruben Amorim's sacking. He added: \"I think it would be great for United. He has the ability to bring that team together again.",
      "\"A lot of those players have been told by Ruben Amorim that they aren't good enough. I think that's something Ole will be able to solve short-term.",
      "\"I don't know if he is the person to take them back to their glory days. I said the same about him at Besiktas, that I didn't know if he could get us back to winning trophies. But at the time, he was the best option because he stabilised things and brought joy back to the players.",
      "\"I think Ole should have been given a lot more time at Besiktas; he could have laid the groundwork for future success with stability around him, which he didn't get. For Manchester United, he is a good option because they're not going to get a top manager at the moment.\"",
      "As a close follower of English football too, Bayazit believes there are similarities between Besiktas and United. He said: \"I've got to know a lot of Manchester United fans recently and the resemblance between them and Besiktas is remarkable, from the state of the squad, backroom politics, the noise around the club, the pressure.",
      "\"That's something people who don't follow Turkish football don't realise. The pressure is so much bigger than 95 per cent of football clubs. Only the biggest clubs in the world know the pressure of the three biggest clubs in Turkey. It's from the fans, the media.",
      "\"I think Ole did well with the pressure. It's a regretful that he got sacked when he did and it sent the club into more chaos. It speaks volumes about what he did in a relative short period of time, because he did bring some stability. But it got blown up by the president who's very reactionary.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has shown his support to Benjamin Sesko on social media after the Slovenian was slammed by pundit Tim Sherwood.",
      "Sesko scored a brace on Wednesday night during the Reds' 2-2 draw at Burnley. The Slovenian has largely struggled since arriving at Old Trafford from RB Leipzig in the summer, having scored just four goals in total for United.",
      "Rashford, meanwhile, has excelled during his loan spell at Barcelona. The Reds academy graduate has scored seven goals and provided 11 assists so far for Hansi Flick's team, but it's clear that the winger has been keeping an eye on events at M16 as well.",
      "The 28-year-old has liked Sesko's latest Instagram post, which shows a series of photos of him celebrating against the Clarets. Sesko said: \"Thanks for support to our fans. We keep going, all together,\" alongside a red love heart and a fist bumping emoji.",
      "Sherwood, however, was not convinced and was reminded that he had suggested Sesko should be substituted at the interval.",
      "He said: \"I think the positive is Sesko scoring two goals. Hopefully he gets some confidence from that.",
      "\"He's took six months to turn up at Man United. I am pleased for the lad, he has had a tough run of it.",
      "\"I had him off the pitch at half time, never wear a Man United shirt again. I stand by what I say, he's not good enough to play for Man United.",
      "\"He's turned up for one game against Burnley who are going to get relegated. Fair play to him, hopefully he gets some confidence and we start seeing something different from him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Reds legend Gary Neville commended Sesko after he skilfully redirected Dorgu's cross. \"Bingo time for Benjamin Sesko,\" he declared.",
      "\"We've not seen him smile much and his team mates are revelling in it with him.",
      "\"He's got in between the centre-backs all night, and he does it again. That's a really good finish. Manchester United have been really good in this second half.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has taken to social media after his goal for Napoli was ruled out for an alleged handball during Wednesday's 2–2 draw with Hellas Verona. The Manchester United loanee finished on the stretch, only for the goal to be chalked off after replays showed the ball had apparently touched his arm in the build‑up.",
      "Taking to Instagram to vent his frustration, Hojlund shared footage of the incident and wrote: \"Didn't even touch the ball with the hand. Well, we go again on Sunday. Forza Napoli sempre,\" followed by a blue love heart and pray emojis.",
      "After the game, Antonio Conte expressed his frustration, saying: \"Hojlund's goal was disallowed because I don't know where he should have had that arm. We have to accept them and we accept them.\"",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport have reported that referee Simone Sozza and the VAR officials have since been suspended, even though the decisions made during the game were 'deemed correct.'",
      "Napoli went 2-0 down at home before Scott McTominay pulled one goal back and ultimately, Giovanni Di Lorenzo rescued a point in the 82nd minute.",
      "McTominay ended his longest Serie A goal drought, a nine‑game run since joining Napoli in 2024, and was awarded Man of the Match.",
      "Conte admitted his side were below their best in the first half, but praised the way they fought back as the game progressed.",
      "\"In the first half there were two negative episodes for us, we could have done better,\" the Italian boss added.",
      "\"On the penalty there was a somewhat peculiar assessment... But we accept it.",
      "\"These two episodes could kill anyone. In the second half we were good at putting our heads on our shoulders.",

      "Hojlund has scored six goals and supplied two assists in 14 Serie A appearances this season, though he was unable to add to his tally this time around after having a goal ruled out.",
      "Napoli hold a €50million (£43.6m) option to make the deal permanent at the end of the loan, which becomes an obligation if they qualify for the Champions League this season.",
      "However, all indications suggest Hojlund is likely to make the move permanently regardless.",

      "Manchester United suffered another setback in the race for Champions League football as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley in Darren Fletcher's first game in charge. United started slowly and went behind after 13 minutes. Casemiro was caught out by Bashir Humphreys' run and Ayden Heaven's weak attempt at blocking the cross saw the ball loop in off the centre-back.",
      "Fletcher's side soon took control and two Benjamin Sesko goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half looked to have turned it around. He finished smartly from a Bruno Fernandes pass and Patrick Dorgu cross. Somehow, United let the hosts back into it. They had barely threatened in the second half when Lisandro Martinez let Jaidon Anthony turn and deliver a curling finish.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Turf Moor:",
      "Senne Lammens: Decision to try and read the cross from Humphreys not a good one but powerless with the second goal. Good with the ball at his feet. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Tidy in possession and tried to get forward in the second half, but didn't have much of an impact. United's narrow approach didn't get him much of the ball. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Turned away from the cross that saw the ball loop in off him, when he should have made himself bigger. Aggressive on the ball at times. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: His weakest game since his return to the side. One wild shot and way too passive against Anthony in the area, giving the winger too much space to equalise. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Got forward well and had an impact in that area. Linked well with Dorgu and made some clever runs, both overlapping and underlapping. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Got quite far forward at times, and although his two shots at goal were wayward, he had a solid game and was better with the ball. 6",
      "Casemiro: A shadow of the player who had done so well earlier in the season. Just watched Humphreys run off him for the first goal, was booked and just too slow to react at times. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Picked a brilliant pass to create the equaliser for Sesko and wanted as much of the ball as he could get. Looked a creative force. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Playing everywhere at the moment. Something of a surprise to see him on the left but gave Kyle Walker a hard time and his cross was perfect for Sesko. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Quieter than he has been in recent weeks. Struggled on the right in the first half and didn't improve much for being moved centrally. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: His best game for the club. Had plenty of chances, held the ball up well, took his two goals brilliantly and forced Martin Dúbravka into another good save with a fine header. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Another centre-half change. Did fine. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled to match the impact of Fernandes. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Came on in a deep area and tried to get on the ball. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Couple of half chances but couldn't take them. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: So unlucky not to score with a brilliant piece of play. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Maguire, Malacia, J. Fletcher",

      "Manchester United supporters' group The 1958 have called for a vote of no confidence against the club's owners, chief executive Omar Berrarda and director of football Jason Wilcox, in fresh protest plans. The group have confirmed that demonstrations against the United hierarchy are set to take place ahead of their clash with Fulham on February 1.",
      "The group have slammed the handling of Ruben Amorim's tenure at Old Trafford describing performances on the pitch as \"medicore\" and \"chaos\" off it. Minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been described as an \"incompetent clown\" after failing to successfully steer the club toward greater heights.",
      "Amorim was sacked by United on Monday, hours after his explosive outburst in the aftermath of their 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road. Darren Fletcher has taken charge on an interim basis and oversaw the encounter against Burnley, which finished 2-2, and will be in the dugout for the FA Cup third round tie against Premier League rivals, Brighton.",
      "The protest brings fresh pressure on the Glazer family, Ratcliffe, and now the new-look footballing operations team at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "There is anger among the supporters who they feel like they have been priced out, marginalised and being treated as an inconvenience.",
      "A protest was held at the end of last season, prior to the showdown with Aston Villa, that saw supporters join forces to voice their concerns about the football club after one of their worst campaigns in top-flight history, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "There had been plans to protest United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, however they were scrapped in light of criticism directed at the decision to include Ratcliffe in the action against the Glazer's control of the club.",
      "After delaying their protests against the INEOS boss next month's clash against Marco Silva's side will be the first opportunity taken by supporters to vent their frustrations. Statements against the board have already began to emerge and did so during the 2-2 draw at Turf Moor on Wednesday, a banner was unfurled in the away end claiming: \"Jim can't fix this.\"",
      "United sit just outside the Champions League places but missed out on another opportunity to break into the top four with Benjamin Sesko's double not enough against Scott Parker's side.",
      "Amorim faced frequent pressure after failing to heed the downturn in results that led to Erik ten Hag's dismissal. The former Sporting CP head coach has been at the helm for numerous low points during his tenure at the club, including defeat in the Carabao Cup to League Two side Grimsby.",
      "A spokesperson for The 1958 group said: “It has been an extraordinary and deeply troubling few days at Manchester United. On the pitch, we are watching mediocre performances from an average team drifting without identity, direction, or ambition. Off it, the chaos is even worse.",
      "“A manager has reportedly been dismissed not primarily for abject performances against Grimsby, Everton, West Ham, and Wolves, but allegedly for a heated exchange with Jason Wilcox. Wilcox a man with just nine months’ experience as a Director of Football at Southampton is said to have attempted to interfere tactically, despite the club hiring Ruben fully aware of his rigid system. The situation beggar’s belief.",
      "“This decision was allegedly endorsed by Omar Berrada, a CEO with no prior experience in the role, listening to the complaints of a close ally rather than exercising independent leadership. We are once again witnessing Manchester United being run by executives learning on the job, at the expense of results, stability, and credibility.",
      "“Let us be clear: this is not a defence of Ruben or the football served up under him. Much of it was unacceptable. But his dismissal once again exposes the continued dysfunction at our club. Manchester United is now a toxic partnership where fans are getting the worst of both worlds.",
      "“WE CALL FOR A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE IN THE OWNERSHIP, BERRADA AND WILCOX.\"",
      "They added: “Earlier this season, we asked supporters if they wanted to protest. Many chose to give Ratcliffe time. That time has been squandered. The situation is undeniably worse. That is why we will protest at Fulham at home on Sunday 1st February.",
      "“Manchester United is 150 years old. That proud history, built by generations of supporters, must be protected.",
      "\"If we do not act now, the club we pass on will be unrecognisable, stripped of its culture, its soul, and its people. “This needs to be stopped. We must fight for our club. We must fight for fan culture before it is too late. If you knew you couldn’t play tomorrow, how hard would you play today?",
      "“For Ratcliffe and the Glazers the game is over. Time is up. We can take no more and urge as many fans as possible to join us in a massive protest.”",

      "Fletcher has been appointed on an interim basis and Burnley could be his only game in charge, with talks having taken place with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week. The former midfielder has made just one change from the draw with Leeds, recalling Fernandes to the starting team at the expense of Leny Yoro, and Fletcher is expected to play with four at the back.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the team's tactical approach, Fletcher said: \"Tactics are fluid in and out of possession. We want movement, we want rotation, we have to exploit the spaces the opponents give you.",
      "\"But the players are the ones who cross the white line who have to deliver. We've got some smart, experienced players. If they see something, I trust them to have the autonomy to exploit it.\"",
      "The 41-year-old also confirmed that starting Fernandes upon his return from injury was always the plan. \"It's important Bruno's back but that was always part of the plan,\" he explained.",
      "\"This game was targeted for a couple of players coming back from injury so we've got a stronger bench tonight. Looking forward to seeing the lads play, we've set them up in a way we think is best for us to win the match that suits their personalities and suits their styles and it's up to them to execute it.\"",
      "United announced Amorim's sacking on Monday. Amorim left with the worst win ratio (32 per cent) in the Premier League of any United manager, but United are still well-positioned to secure European football.",
      "The Reds are sixth in the top flight, just three points adrift of Liverpool in fourth position.",

In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",

Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "The irony of Manchester United's new power structure appointing Ruben Amorim as the club's first head coach in November 2024 is that a few months earlier, his name hadn't really been in the frame at all. That was the summer when Liverpool considered appointing Amorim, only to opt for Arne Slot amid concerns over the Portuguese's system, his stubbornness in playing it and how the squad would fit. Those concerns were cast aside at Old Trafford later in the year.",
      "But for a few heady, confusing weeks in the summer of 2024, change was in the air at United, too. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had decided to sack Erik ten Hag and contenders to replace him were lined up on the catwalk. Then Ten Hag won the FA Cup final, United dithered and the Dutchman stayed, new contract, pay rise and all.",
      "Before that, Ratcliffe spoke to potential replacements as United scoured the market. They met with Thomas Tuchel in Monaco and the German was right at the top of the list of likely appointments, should they have gone through with the decision to dispense with Ten Hag.",
      "There were also talks with Premier League managers, as Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi were all considered. However, there was little indication that Amorim was part of the conversation before the Ibiza summit, which led to Ten Hag staying.",
      "That decision was reversed within four months, with no improvement in results under the Dutchman. As United looked for a replacement this time, Amorim was high on the shortlist. For all the reservations of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and his colleagues at Anfield, the Sporting head coach's stock was high.",
      "Perhaps the switch to Amorim and a coach with such a unique style of play can be attributed to chief executive Omar Berrada settling into the job. Berrada was particularly taken by Amorim's personality and charisma. Speaking to the BBC in March of this year, Ratcliffe explained the decision to stick with Ten Hag as one made at \"short notice\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, we are a consensus organisation,\" he said. \"So there's a collection of us who make decisions. It's not just me that makes the decision, it involves that management team.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes. Omar [Berrada] had only just arrived, Jason [Wilcox] had not been there terribly long, so we didn't really have the management team in place for very long to make… it was a very difficult decision to make at short notice.\"",
      "That consensus was lacking when Amorim was appointed. Berrada and Ratcliffe might have been on board with the decision, but Wilcox needed convincing and Ashworth's doubts never dissipated. Having insisted that a football structure would make a decision on a style of play, Ratcliffe turned to a head coach who was unique in this department.",
      "What does that tell us about the next search for a head coach, now that Amorim has gone? The structure is more settled, with Ashworth having also left. Berrada and Wilcox are the key figures, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell on the rise. Ratcliffe will again be involved.",
      "The management team that Ratcliffe discussed should be able to make the right decision this time, but they will be under pressure to do so. Given the names under consideration in June 2024, the decision to appoint Amorim felt like a change in strategy. Maybe it warns us to expect the unexpected as United consider their options this time around.",

      "Manchester United supporters have delivered a clear message to Sir Jim Ratcliffe before tonight's Premier League encounter at Burnley following Ruben Amorim's dismissal. Amorim departed the club on Monday morning, less than 24 hours after the 1-1 stalemate at Leeds United.",
      "The decision followed the Portuguese manager's explosive outburst during his post-match media briefing. Darren Fletcher has been installed as caretaker boss for the fixture at Turf Moor, whilst the club weighs up their options for appointing an interim head coach through to the season's conclusion.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick emerge as the frontrunners. Nevertheless, the visiting supporters at Burnley have voiced their opinions on the circumstances.",
      "A banner declaring: \"JIM CAN'T FIX THIS\" was visible from the away section before kick-off. Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada have also faced criticism this week.",
      "It's believed that Wilcox arranged a discussion with Amorim last week regarding tactical matters, though it ended with both parties failing to reach a consensus.",
      "Prior to the match, it was revealed that Solskjaer and Carrick had both held additional discussions with the United hierarchy.",
      "Solskjaer is reportedly the preferred choice to assume control for the remainder of this campaign, having previously excelled in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "The Norwegian succeeded Jose Mourinho in 2018 and secured victory in 14 of his 19 matches as interim manager before receiving the permanent appointment.",
      "He guided the club to a runner-up position and consecutive top-four placings, though was dismissed in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer is set to return to Norway tomorrow from his Cheshire residence to attend a close friend's funeral.",
      "However, it's understood that he could be appointed before the start of next week. A permanent successor is anticipated to take over at the end of the season.",
      "Thomas Tuchel, who was previously targeted before the appointment of Amorim in November 2024, remains a top contender.",
      "Other potential candidates include Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino.",

      "It's looking like United's search for a permanent boss will be put on hold until the summer, with Oliver Glasner among the favourites to be given the role on a full-time basis. Everyone wants to know who the new man in the Old Trafford hotseat will be and we're here to answer your questions on the topic.",

      "It will be a proud night for the Fletcher family when Darren enters the dugout, potentially with sons Jack and Tyler following, for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor. The 41-year-old was appointed interim manager of the Reds on Monday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "In his first press conference, Fletcher refused to say whether his twin sons, who joined from Manchester City in 2023, would be part of the matchday squad. But if they are, it will undoubtedly be the first time a manager and his twins have been part of the backroom staff and squad in the Premier League.",
      "While that is not a guarantee to happen tonight, there are some scenarios which we expect to pan out at Turf Moor during Fletcher's first game in charge of the Reds. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we think will happen.",
      "Considering the fallout from Amorim's sacking, it seems highly unlikely Fletcher will choose to stick with a back three formation. The Portuguese head coach looked to appease the owners on Boxing Day by playing a back four against Newcastle and it worked.",
      "By no means was the performance perfect, particularly in the second half, but it was the last time United tasted victory and it seems certain the back four will return at Turf Moor. It also makes more sense to play a four at the back now, considering the players at Fletcher's disposal.",
      "Amad is United's best wing-back but he is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Diogo Dalot has played on the left and right, but he is much better as a full-back and thus a return to this system would be beneficial for the Reds.",
      "There must have been an audible sigh of relief among United households across the world when Fletcher announced Bruno Fernandes would be back in the matchday squad tonight. Not only is Fernandes the captain, but he is also the star player in a team which struggles for consistency.",
      "You have to wonder in the games against Wolves and Leeds whether United would have won had Fernandes been on the park. The Portuguese midfielder has a knack of creating moments of magic out of seemingly impossible situations and his creativity has been missed desperately.",
      "Of course, Fernandes may not play the full 90 minutes, considering his recent return from injury. But, we can expect Fletcher to lean in heavily on the captain and potentially even start him - if only for the first 45 minutes - to rouse the troops.",
      "Whether the fans make their feelings towards the boardroom clear tonight will be interesting to see. A lot of supporters have been left angered by the manner in which Sir Jim Ratcliffe has run football operations since acquiring a minority stake in the club.",
      "This does not necessarily mean they are unhappy Amorim has gone, but there will likely be a large amount of fans travelling to Burnley who feel Ratcliffe has embarrassed the club with another quick upheaval. Should the travelling supporters voice those opinions, remains to be seen.",
      "What is not in doubt is the rousing reception Fletcher will receive as he strides out at Turf Moor this evening. United fans adore most of their ex-players, as will be proven if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes on the caretaker role until the end of the season.",
      "And one certainty Fletcher can rely on is the away fans backing both him and the team tonight.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur’s decision on whether to sack head coach Thomas Frank will be determined by one ‘pivotal’ factor.",
      "Former Brentford boss Frank replaced Ange Postecoglou at Spurs in the summer and was tasked with steadying the ship after their shambolic performances in the Premier League last term.",
      "Frank has turned Spurs into more of a defensive unit this term and they initially benefited from this change, but performances and results have massively declined in recent months.",
      "The north London outfit have only won one of their previous 13 matches in all competitions as Frank has alienated himself with his uninspiring tactics and odd outbursts in press conferences.",
      "Spurs suffered another defeat on Wednesday night as they were beaten 3-2 by AFC Bournemouth, who headed into the match on a run of ten games without a victory.",
      "READ: Premier League sack race: Nuno and Frank in a grim race to the bottom",
      "Speaking on Thursday afternoon, Frank explained why he thinks his side has deserved more points from their recent matches. He said: “I think the last five games we played, it has been consistent, good, competitive performances and that’s what you need in a long season.",
      "“Those five games should have given us more than the five points we got. Probably eight, nine, 10 points. That’s what we are focusing on.",
      "“It is my job to deal with scrutiny. I will take all the questions and the blame. It is also my job to look through everything and look through the defeat last night. It was emotional but in many ways it was good and we deserve more.",
      "“We need to keep doing that. The last two games should have got us four points maybe more.”",
      "Frank will hope that there is a response from this side when they face Aston Villa in the FA Cup on Saturday and beyond, with a report from journalsit Fraser Fletcher for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming the club is ‘growing increasingly alarmed and considering all options’.",
      "MORE SPURS COVERAGE ON F365…\n* Spurs to sack Frank as Rosenior rues forced Chelsea promotion on perfect night for Arsenal\n* Tottenham small-time it again after encouraging start as Thomas Frank shuffles closer to the exit\n* Real Madrid want Tottenham defender as Spurs ‘look to make a game-changing signing in attack’",
      "It is also explained that the head coach ‘faces a pivotal period to avoid the sack’: ‘Tottenham’s upcoming fixtures are seen as make-or-break for Frank. Next up is a home FA Cup third-round tie against in-form Aston Villa this weekend, followed by a crucial Premier League clash with West Ham United at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on January 17.",
      "‘Following those is a Champions League encounter with Borussia Dortmund on January 20 – three home games that sources describe as “pivotal” in determining the 52-year-old’s immediate future.’",
      "Another report from TEAMtalk claims current Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi is Tottenham’s ‘top target’ to replace Frank, though he would ‘favour’ a move to Man Utd if they also made an ‘approach’.",
      "A source for the outlet said: “He’s flattered by Tottenham’s interest, but United would likely be priority.”",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank has spoken of Cristian Romero after the club captain attacked the board and higher ups.",
      "It’s a race between Nuno Espirito Santo and Thomas Frank to see who can get sacked first. We’re trying to work out how they can both lose.",
      "According to reports, a Tottenham Hotspur chief has ‘demanded’ head coach Thomas Frank to be sacked after the 3-2 loss against AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Thomas Frank has lost another football match while holding an Arsenal cup. Who might replace him at Spurs?",
      "Arsenal were the biggest winners of the night, but there’s no bigger loser than Thomas Frank, who should be sacked after Dr Tottenham’s Bournemouth visit.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is very interested in becoming the next permanent manager of Manchester United."

      "“What I’m told is that Man Utd will only approve this solution for Zirkzee to leave the club if they can get a replacement.",
      "“So Man Utd have started exploring the market again after they failed to reach an agreement with Antoine Semenyo.",

      "“Trusting young players and playing quality football will also be essential parts of the project, especially for INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, whose latest crime is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of the boardroom suits. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, and one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "Arsenal next, and a non-zero chance that any repeat of the Etihad capitulation in the face of the only compellingly good team in the league could spell the end.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated.

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 20 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and basically had nothing to do v Palace.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in. Though he’s hardly convincing…",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save v Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Will be lucky to keep his place after the FA Cup game week.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he? It has been a rotten few weeks for the Cherries keeper.",
      "",
      "",

      "Why aren’t Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox falling on their Man Utd sword? The clown club dominate the narrative once again.",
      "Darren Fletcher can probably be removed from a Manchester United caretaker manager race which has been whittled down to two sides of the same Ferguson coin.",

Though neither of them in retrospect has turned out well. But I continue undaunted. So let me share with you why none of this is doom and gloom.",
      "It turns out this is a good year to be a bit rubbish, as there are 17 teams that are vying to be crisis clubs on any given weekend. (The goal difference column makes interesting reading). So we are still somehow knocking on the Champions League spots and as I see it, 2 out of United, Liverpool and Chelsea are likely to make it. It’s anybody’s guess how that pans out. But I’d give each club equal chance at this point which means we have a 66% shot at CL.",
      "There is a constant drumbeat about how the players aren’t good enough and why the squad needs another x windows to sort out. This is rubbish, imho. This is a group of players who are definitely good enough to get into the top 5 of the league. United have had a history of late of somehow devaluing players and seeing them shine elsewhere. Largely because they didn’t fit the system and were being played out of position (McTominay), or just worn down by the lack of support and success (Rashford, Hojlund). Players were also encouraged to become d*ckheads (Garnacho/ Sancho) rather than buckle down and perform.",
      "Solskjaer’s term ended badly but there were good things about it – much like this year, we did well against the big teams playing a counterattacking style, and then with Bruno we were also able to break down deep lying defences. It all fell apart in trying to accommodate Ronaldo who liked to stay up further and Maguire, who needs to play deep.",
      "Failure isn’t the monster everybody makes it out to be. Failure without learning is where the problem is. As long as the Ineos group learn from their mistakes, and there is a sense of progression, I’m happy enough. Transfers have definitely been more on the money in the past year and this year we obviously have specific problems that are fixable. We’ve done badly against the bottom half of teams, and we have conceded too many goals despite the 3 at the back structure. I feel both of these can be addressed with some tactical flexibility and game management.",
      "Lastly, none of this would be a problem if Amorim had won 3 more matches – wins against Everton, West Ham, and Wolves – all 3 very winnable games would have removed all the swirling questions and issues, and it feels a little bit like Amorim chose to die on his formation hill – and that’s a shame because no manager can survive in the long term without tactical flexibility. Hopefully that’s something Amorim has taken away from this experience.",
      "What United need to learn perhaps is that before we aim for winning the league, we should aim for a couple of years of consistently finishing in the top 4 and building a squad capable of challenging on multiple fronts. If Solskjaer or the next manager can get us there over the next 3 years and then we get in somebody for a big push that probably is a better idea than sitting in 12th place and dreaming about winning the title.\nVed Sen, Optimistically, MUFC",

      "1. In August/September, they were hailed as “mentality monsters” as they won a succession of tight games in injury time or the last 10 minutes of normal time. Sign of champions, they’ll be unbeatable when they click, etc.",
      "2. Things turned, they lost a slew of games and conceded some late goals in the process. Turns out they’d been papering over the cracks and their luck had to run out some time. Directly contradicts the above, but everyone got a pass for ever thinking that.",
      "3. The crap run dragged on longer than expected, some people attributed it to grief while others focused on the form of their £400k-per-week totems falling off a cliff. New signings had been almost uniformly shit for months, so the scrutiny turned to Slot and how he was on borrowed time. Manager is a fraud, last season an aberration, can’t handle adversity, etc. etc.",
      "4. Salah decided to give a “me me meeeee” interview, got rightly dropped, promptly f*cked off to AFCON. One problem temporarily out of the picture, Liverpool’s form stabilised slightly after that, and they now sit atop the pile of mush occupying 4th-14th in the table. Cue the “transitional period” guff as the above rationales fade from relevance and fans scramble to explain the current state of affairs, which feels quite sterile from afar.",
      "In the space of less than 5 months this team has tumbled from heavy odds title favourites to distant also-rans, and to my eyes at least it’s because of a series of questionable decisions that have directly impacted them on the pitch. Throwing crazy money at Van Dijk and Salah, buying a pair of expensive full-backs who can’t defend, spunking £200m on strikers and neglecting more pressing needs in the squad.",
      "None of those things are markers of a club in transition whatsoever. They’re expensive, flawed decisions which were intended to stand on the league’s throat from a position of strength. The players who came in were all ready-made first teamers with the exception of Leoni. They were supposed to strengthen and refresh the squad, not form the foundation of a long-term rebuild. The players who left were also sold by choice, intended to be swapped out for incoming upgrades.",
      "When that approach backfires, you don’t get to retreat behind a wall of your own construction that you’ve covered in graffiti proclaiming that last season’s success only prolonged the inevitable after Klopp left. Trying to protect yourself from the slings and arrows from other fans with bull like that only makes you look childish. This isn’t a transition, it was fully intended to be a progression. You don’t have to like the direction of travel, and right now I wouldn’t blame Liverpool fans for that. But stop trying to sell the rest of us an absolute pup.\nKeith Reilly",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

Sir Jim Ratcliffe finally got his wish with a four-man defence but will probably be wondering why Bryan Mbeumo wasn’t picked at right-back.",
      "It conjured a positive performance worthy of victory. Manchester United had 30 shots to Burnley’s seven, with ten on target to one. Yet they still contrived to draw to a team consigned by most to relegation.",
      "Had Shea Lacey, the exciting academy graduate winger, shot marginally lower after collecting a Mason Mount pass and running at an increasingly panicked Lucas Pires in the 85th minute, then Fletcher would have had his crowning moment in the big chair.",
      "But try as he might, even with five positive and sensible substitutions, an attacking gameplan and the revitalisation of Benjamin Sesko, this is a club currently lacking fortune almost as much as it is intelligent thought and vague levels of competence.",
      "Fletcher wanted “to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball, don’t hide,” and it’s difficult to pinpoint anyone who specifically failed on those fronts. Casemiro and Lisandro Martinez could have done far better for the Burnley goals but it was an approach and display which, nine times out of ten, would have delivered a victory.",
      "This simply happened to be the one, and the first time a Ferguson disciple turned interim manager has failed to win their first game.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "Ryan Giggs, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy all proudly discussed having consulted Ferguson over their caretakership, all said the right things about passion, bravery, imagination and expression, and all savoured vibe-restoring, feel-good victories from the dugout as the support chanted their name again to escape the misery of the prior months.",
      "Fletcher was certainly embraced by the travelling fans as the latest saviour temporarily promoted from the former players’ WhatsApp group, but will have noted how Solskjaer and Carrick also had their songs given a run-out during a third straight draw against a team in the bottom five.",
      "Those who will ultimately decide which legend is pestered over tactics for the next four months by Jason Wilcox might have preferred a clearer indication of the populist choice.",
      "And this really did little to boost or block Fletcher’s candidacy. A good performance produced a poor result, neither of which really moves the needle sufficiently for or against him.",
      "The goals conceded were a deflected cross and a wonderful individual effort. The goals scored were the result of smart moves, the first a direct consequence of Fletcher’s half-time redeployment of Bruno Fernandes on the right. Two wrongs don’t make a right and 2-2 probably doesn’t extend this spell past one more game at most.",
      "Thus Manchester United, despite slipping below a quite absurd Newcastle team, are back precisely where they started. With the next appointment being purely for the rest of this season it is tough to imagine how either Solskjaer or Carrick set themselves apart from the other when both are seeking the counsel and advice of the same 84-year-old elephant in every room at Old Trafford and Carrington, both will be signing from the same hymn sheet about identity and culture, and both can point to past ship-steadying exploits, achieved with a great many of these players.",
      "It is a decision which can likely be put off past the weekend, when Brighton visit in the FA Cup. There lies the last opportunity for Manchester United to adorn this season with a trophy, but beyond that are their next two Premier League opponents: Manchester City and Arsenal on January 17 and 25 respectively.",
      "There is still plenty to play for, still a Champions League place to secure and a season to stabilise. Fletcher’s chance to make a compelling argument that he should be trusted with those responsibilities has passed; Manchester United have a week or so to make a decision they have already proven they cannot be trusted with.",

      "Keith Wyness has explained why Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner might turn down the opportunity to manage Manchester United.",
      "United are searching for a new manager after sacking Ruben Amorim on Monday, with Palace boss Glasner among the favourites.",
      "The Premier League giants are expected to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season before naming Amorim’s permanent successor, with former manager and club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer expected to take charge in the short term.",
      "Amorim was the Red Devils’ seventh – and worst – managerial appointment since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "He led the club to an all-time low 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season and leaves them currently sixth in the table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.",
      "Solskjaer is expected to come in to steady the ship and help United qualify for the Champions League. However, when the summer arrives, a permanent boss will be tasked with the poisoned chalice of managing at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim was the first appointment made by the club’s new hierarchy led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who backed the Portuguese coach with over £200 million in transfer funds last summer despite an abysmal 2024/25 campaign.",
      "It remains unclear whether Ratcliffe will commit further significant investment for Amorim’s successor. If the new manager is asked to work with the existing squad rather than being heavily backed in the market, the British billionaire could struggle to attract his top target.",
      "The club’s number-one target is reportedly Glasner, who led Crystal Palace to the FA Cup last season, the first major trophy in the club’s history.",
      "The Austrian has done an outstanding job at Selhurst Park but has been outspoken about the club’s ownership and lack of backing in the transfer market.",

      "MEDIAWATCH: New Man United manager ‘agreement reached’ as past Solskjaer sympathises with present Amorim",
      "Speaking to Football Insider’s Inside Track podcast, he said: “Is there another two or three hundred million for him to get the squad in the way that he wants to do it now? They’ll say they want a coach rather than a manager.",
      "“That was one of the big things with Amorim, which is open for debate. I knew he was coming in basically as a coach, I’m pretty sure about that. But what will Glasner want to do? No doubt he can be more flexible and he can definitely bring something slightly different in terms of the way he’s going to manage things. But will he be happy with the squad he’s got or is he just going to accept the Man United job and say, this is what you’ve got, go on and manage it?",
      "“It’s a whole different Man United proposition, rather than coming in as it used to be, getting the big job at Man United, having money to put your own imprint on the club.",
      "“Glasner does seem favourite at the moment. There’s a number of other names in the hat, but still, if I’m Oliver Glasner, I’ve got to think, is this really the Man United club that I want to go to?",
      "“Now, if they don’t get Champions League again, Glasner might be thinking twice as well. So if he’s the first choice, they may not get it and that’s the reality of where Man United are right now.”",

      "Manchester United seem likely to go for the caretaker manager option, so we have made things a little easier for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick.",
      "Those appear to be the leading candidates for the role of temporarily making Manchester United feel a little bit better about themselves, before a more permanent arrangement is made in the summer.",
      "Here is a handy checklist for Solskjaer, Carrick, Darren Fletcher, Ruud van Nistelrooy or Dong Fangzhuo to work through when they are appointed.",
      "",
      "Obviously. It’s not physically possible for someone who played for Manchester United between the years of 1986 and 2013 to make any life decision without first consulting and seeking the blessing of Sir Alex/the gaffer/the boss.",
      "Manchester United want you as caretaker manager? Best ask Fergie before literally anyone else.",
      "Not 100 per cent sure what to wear to this work do later? Send the big man a message.",
      "Cook something in or order a takeaway? Just let me ring this 84-year-old widower I’ve not seen in years and he can decide.",
      "The next step is to then proudly and openly tell a room of fellow adults about how the immediate instinct at any mildly important juncture in your existence is to discuss things not with your wife and family but your boss of at least a decade and a half ago, and for that room of fellow adults to somehow not burst into simultaneously uproarious laughter.",
      "This is not a particular dig at any of those individuals and their blind veneration of Ferguson, more the wider culture whereby Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada literally invited him over for coffee on Tuesday morning because Manchester United cannot get over the man who literally recommended David Moyes as his replacement – and nor does Ferguson really want them to.",
      "",
      "The open net any caretaker manager worth the time and effort must convert is the reinstatement of a popular but ostracised player to the starting line-up.",
      "And to his credit, Amorim has provided a delicious ball into the box by making Mainoo, an academy graduate more than gifted enough to make a difference in a problem position, such a prominent talking point.",
      "Mainoo is the big winner of the latest Manchester United sacking, and so too is the manager who can come in, put an arm around him and accept the plaudits for picking one of the better players in the squad over Manuel Ugarte.",
      "",
      "The other side of that coin is to unceremoniously drop someone clearly favoured during the previous failed reign.",
      "The Mainoo restoration makes Ugarte a natural and obvious candidate there but it feels like more separation from the Amorim regime is needed.",
      "Diogo Dalot is a compelling option. He made more appearances under Amorim (54) than every player bar Bruno Fernandes (58), having also made the podium during Erik ten Hag’s time at Old Trafford.",
      "And rarely if at all has he warranted that level of esteem or protection. A thoroughly mediocre player on whichever side he is deployed, Dalot ought to be far more vulnerable as a clear favourite of the last two sacked managers; sticking him on the bench for a bit is an easy win.",
      "",
      "Like dating after a break-up and becoming infatuated with someone purely because they don’t actively sh*t themselves, even the lowest bars must be cleared.",
      "",

      "Fletcher believes it comes down to how players “embrace the challenge” and become “excited” by it.",
      "It all links back to the tenets established by Sir Matt Busby and elucidated by perhaps their greatest exponent, Sir Bobby Charlton:",
      "“Giving young players a chance, playing adventurous football, being aggressive. Don’t be afraid. Go for it. Manchester United has never played defensive football, it’s always played attacking, adventurous football. It’s always had the type of players that were expressive.”",
      "Four at the back. Two quick wingers either side. Fred the Red up top. All tactical decision made by an open committee including Ratcliffe, Wilcox and the estate of George Best, obviously with Sir Alex being phoned before anything is finalised.",
      "",
      "An act of absurd defence almost definitely rectified in the two-and-a-half years between his permanent appointment and eventual sacking, it is nevertheless intoxicating – and frankly really quite easy – to imagine that Solskjaer continued to see Ferguson’s former parking space as sacrosanct throughout his tenure.",
      "“It just doesn’t feel right parking there. It’s still the gaffer’s place,” the Norwegian reportedly told staff in April 2019, the ludicrously potent early vibes from his caretaker reign having finally started to wear off.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has almost certainly installed a parking meter in the space so when Solskjaer learns that Ferguson has been unknowingly racking up hundreds of thousands of pounds of unpaid charges, he can just get Rio to pin a GoFundMe in the former players’ WhatsApp group to sort it as they all compete to see who pays off the most.",
      "",
      "Arguably the most important box for an interim to tick can only really be done when facing questions from the media about anything beyond basically the next game.",
      "You cannot lead with it unprompted for that would be insane and the entire world would freeze in panic, not knowing what course of action to take next. So wait patiently for the question or any variation thereof to be put to you at a press conference:",

      "Despite all this, part-owner Jim Ratcliffe said in the summer that Amorim should be judged over three years but Owen believes there was always “scepticism” about the Portuguese boss.",
      "“With regard to problems Amorim had,” Owen said. “I think the one positive he had, was I think people liked him, the way he spoke and how he articulated things and how honest he was. And I think that was an absolute stark contrast to his predecessor, Ten Hag.",
      "“I actually think Amorim’s honesty and his take on things was quite refreshing, and he would quite openly say, This is the worst Manchester United team there’s ever been, and all these things.",
      "“So it’s quite refreshing when you see that from a manager. So that possibly is one of the reasons why he kept the job after some real dips, because his results at the end of the day, compared to any manager in the last decades, were worse.",
      "READ: Solskjaer told to block ‘absurd’ Neville and ignore shadow of Sir Alex…",
      "“So I think there was a little bit of that. And I also think there was a little bit of everybody thinking, we can’t just keep changing the manager. So people were willing to give him even longer.",
      "“However, I do think behind the scenes, there was scepticism. I do think the results, I do think the system and the way he was reluctant to change had a big bearing on that. I do think that probably the powers above him were not convinced. Once he was going to step out of line, let’s say, in this situation, it almost gave them the perfect excuse to say ‘right, well, we weren’t happy anyway, so this is the perfect time to do it.’ I think that’s what happened.”",
      "For those reasons, Owen said he was not “surprised at all” by the decision and linked it to Enzo Maresca’s departure from Chelsea.",
      "The former Liverpool and Manchester United striker added: “I think both scenarios, Maresca at Chelsea and Amorim at Manchester United, both almost happened quickly. A week before, there was nothing.",
      "“In the lead up to the game against Leeds, I was doing the game on TV, and all the chat behind the scenes was, Amorim, there’s been a big bust-up. So I knew before the game that this could escalate rather like it did with Maresca. And of course, in many ways, it’s a very similar scenario.",

      "“Now there’s plenty of different departments that all need to be happy. So, yeah, it did happen quick, but I wasn’t surprised at all. I was a little bit surprised with what he said after the game, but I knew that there was trouble behind the scenes. But as soon as he said it, I wasn’t surprised that it ended quickly.

Who would you like to see go in there? Because it’s obviously going to take some type of manager to work under that system that they have at the club. They’ve tried the younger coaches.",

      "As Manchester United look to their past once again, Adam Bate reports from Turf Moor after Darren Fletcher's first game in interim charge and argues that trying to recreate what's been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement is not the way forward",
      "Thursday 8 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Burnley did not have a shot on target in the first half but they did not need one to lead at the break, Bashir Humphreys' cross deflected beyond Senne Lammens after taking a wicked deflection off the unfortunate Ayden Heaven that saw the ball loop into the net.",
      "United, playing in a 4-2-3-1 formation, had ample opportunities to level it up before the interval but Sesko had a hat-trick of chances saved by Martin Dubravka. Humphreys and Maxime Esteve cleared efforts off the line. Lisandro Martinez had a goal disallowed.",
      "Fletcher switched Matheus Cunha and Bruno Fernandes at the interval, the change reaping dividends with the skipper threaded a pass through for Sesko to finish emphatically. The Slovenian then converted Patrick Dorgu's cross for a second goal.",
      "Credit to Burnley for finding a response thanks to Anthony, the substitute cutting in on his left foot and firing an unstoppable shot high beyond Lammens. United youngster Shea Lacey almost responded in kind but saw his effort come back off the bar.",
      "Instead, it is a third straight draw for United - against Wolves, Leeds and Burnley. Fletcher was serenaded by the away support, nevertheless, as Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada looked on. A time of change off the pitch but another tough result on it.",
      "Man Utd interim head coach Darren Fletcher on Benjamin Sesko:",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs.",
      "\"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well. And like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, you hit the back of the net, it builds your confidence and hopefully it starts flowing for him from there.",
      "\"Everyone can see his qualities, I thought he was fantastic tonight, he led the line really well and maybe he could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive for the night really, his two goals, and hopefully that's good for Manchester United's future.\"",
      "\"The positive is Sesko scoring. Hopefully he gets some confidence. It's taken him six months to turn up but I'm pleased for him.",
      "\"He's had a tough run and I'd have had him off the pitch at half-time, never to wear a Manchester United shirt again. I stand by what I said, he's not good enough to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"He's turned up for one game against Burnley who are going to get relegated. Hopefully we start seeing something different from him.\"",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker speaking in the press conference:",
      "\"Everything I demanded of the team and the team demanded of themselves was there. I wanted a reaction. We were bitterly disappointed by the overall performance and what we produced at Brighton. This was getting back to what we need to bring to a Premier League game of football.",
      "\"We started the game really well and to go 2-1 down, we needed a reaction and we produced that. It was an improvement for us as a team and overall a massive point for us and more importantly the character of the team in adversity, they stood up and got a result. It is definitely a stepping stone.\"",

      "Had Shea Lacey's late strike found the net rather than the frame of the goal, it would have been one of those magical Manchester United moments. A young player who the supporters had wanted Ruben Amorim to trust with more minutes proving the hero.",
      "That Lacey was on the pitch at all was a product of more than Darren Fletcher's desire to lean into United's youth legacy but an attacking switch that saw United finish the game with Burnley at Turf Moor with a midfield duo of Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "The away support appreciated it, chanting Fletcher's name as well as that of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick - two men touted with a return. But United need more than mere sentiment right now, they are chasing Champions League football.",
      "Games against Wolves, Leeds and Burnley have not yielded a single victory. They have now contrived to drop points to all of the bottom seven teams in the table since November. Even five points from the last three games would have United in the top four.",
      "It feels like an opportunity missed with games against Manchester City and Arsenal now to come. But if Fletcher can help change the mood and can get Benjamin Sesko firing, then the chance is still there for this to be a season of progress rather than a wasted one.Adam Bate",
      "Thomas Frank's Tottenham are a mess. And what's worse, they're a boring mess.",
      "Even a last-minute 3-2 loss at Bournemouth, one of their more assured performances of the season, was still far from a riveting watch despite the drama on display.",
      "There is little for the Spurs fans to cling onto. So little that even fan favourite Micky van de Ven ended up in heated discussion with the away support at the Vitality Stadium. No surprise after watching one goal in open play from their last seven matches combined.",
      "It creates a narrative that this is the kind of football Frank plays. And that is one he can barely argue, because it is what Spurs fans have been forced to endure week after week this season. But it was not always like this.",
      "\"What he has to show and tell everybody now is that he's not just a set-piece coach. Because that's what he looks like right now.\"",
      "Those nights at the Gtech playing through the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City and putting four past Manchester United feel a world away.",
      "Brentford scored more goals in open play than Chelsea last season. They were the fifth-highest scorers overall and produced 1.5xG fewer than Arsenal across the course of the campaign.",
      "But at a side with resources he could have only dreamt of 12 months ago, he has overseen relative drops in every single attacking metric.",
      "His old Brentford side was crafted with Matthew Benham's superbly honed data-driven system with a hit rate for finding hidden gems to rival any Premier League scouting department.",
      "He does not have that tailor-made side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but that does not mount anything like a sufficient excuse for the insipid football he has served up in his first six months.",
      "With results and style so poor, it's inevitable the pressure is ramping up around Frank. He must find a way to change things and fast before it is taken out of his hands.Ron Walker",
      "It's been a tough start to 2026 for Man City.",
      "They are without a win so far this year and they've been hit with injuries to key players. Central defenders Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias and winger Savinho have sufferred significant injuries. John Stones is also on the sidelines too as City were forced to field an unfamiliar pair at the back in 21-year-old Abdukodir Khusanov and debutant Max Alleyne.",
      "And while Brighton did spurn some really good early chances, it wasn't City's makeshift defence that cost them victory at the Etihad.",
      "Pep Guardiola bemoaned the chances his side wasted, not only against Brighton, but also in the draws against Sunderland and Chelsea.",
      "Guardiola said: \"The result is the result. I'm not a person who believes what we have done isn't fair. One point for them, one point for us. That is what it is. I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",
      "Newcastle's meeting with Leeds might have gone down as a classic even without the 102nd-minute Harvey Barnes goal that tilted it the way of the hosts. With the Bruno Guimaraes penalty in the 91st minute, Newcastle had already come from behind three times for the first time in the league since 1996. It felt dramatic enough.",
      "But with that swing of his right boot, surrounded by blue-shirted defenders, Barnes secured its place in history. He described it as a \"blur\" after the game and it was a similar experience for those watching. A breathless encounter throughout.",
      "It was a heart-breaking outcome for Leeds, who took a deserved lead through Brenden Aaronson's superb first-half strike and kept putting their noses back in front. Their brave performance, at a ground were so many teams struggle, deserves acclaim.",
      "For the neutral, the end-to-end action of the game was a tonic to some of the stop-start, set-piece-heavy offerings served up in the Premier League this season.",
      "The number of goals could easily have been higher. The woodwork was struck three times. There were goalmouth scrambles, goalkeeper saves, last-ditch defensive interventions galore. It was an occasion to savour, albeit not for Leeds fans.Nick Wright",
      "Liam Rosenior will have seen first-hand a major issue for this Chelsea team: a lack of discipline.",
      "Marc Cucurella's red card was as blatant as they come (whether the foul continued into the penalty area and should have been a spot-kick is another debate).",
      "It was Chelsea's seventh red card across all competitions - that's four more than any other Premier League team. They're just one off their Premier League record of six with almost half a season to go.",
      "Afterwards, caretaker boss Calum McFarlane argued the sending off was not an example of ill-discipline but admitted the flurry of yellow cards which followed it could be looked at.",
      "But while Rosenior has spoken about his desire for intensity from his team, Chelsea have crossed the line too many times this season. And it's costing them. This is the third Premier League game Chelsea have lost after seeing a player sent off and that's before the impact of suspensions through reds and accumulated yellows is analysed.Peter Smith",
      "It's Harry Wilson's world and we're just living in it. \"Right now everything that he touches becomes something magic,\" said his boss Marco Silva, after the Welshman hit Fulham's winner against 10-man Chelsea.",
      "That's nine goal involvements in his past 10 games for Wilson. \"The numbers are top, incredible,\" added the Fulham head coach.",
      "Silva reckons this is Wilson's \"best moment\" of his career and it's hard to argue. Of course there have been other standout moments for him in a Fulham shirt but Silva noted how the pair had a conversation last season to help try to draw out these kind of consistently impactful performances.",
      "\"In terms of maturity, decision-making, more calm in some moments - you don't need 100 per cent speed in everything,\" Silva explained.",
      "Wilson, Silva and Fulham are reaping the rewards now.Peter Smith",
      "\"Because of my career and the teams I've managed, I've been through a lot of these awkward games.\" And Sean Dyche tends to succeed in most of them.",
      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",
      "\"It's not easy on anybody,\" he concluded. \"The players, overall, have just about deserved it.\"David Richardson",
      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 16:50, UK",
      "Darren Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley has meant a temporary halt to the active talks with candidates as everyone at the club focuses on that match, but I'd expect things to accelerate towards the back end of this week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",
      "While other top clubs might consider playing a changed team in this weekend's FA Cup third round to prioritise their Premier League campaigns, the competition is really important for Manchester United - who host Brighton on Sunday.",
      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",
      "The extra games United would gain from a cup run could prove very important for the rest of their season, as the new head coach (or coaches) try to bed-in their tactical system, and also get some much-needed game-time for the wider squad.",
      "If it is Solskjaer who takes over, his first spell in charge in 2021 saw him predominantly go with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which this current United squad has - famously - rarely used.",
      "Finding successful partnerships in the new system, working out which players are best in which positions, maybe re-integrating Kobbie Mainoo into the starting XI - all those things would be easier with the extra matches a cup run would bring.",
      "So, Sunday is not a game that United can take lightly. And part of their decision about the coaching quandary will be dictated by what is best for the team at that stage.",
      "Is it best to leave Fletcher in charge at Old Trafford for the tie, or better to bring the new man (or men) in at the first opportunity? A thorough assessment of the game against Burnley will be required.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 22:11, UK",
      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
