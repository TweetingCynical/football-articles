      "Manchester United will NOT allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club on deadline day. Mainoo, 20, has found opportunities limited under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "That led to suggestions he could leave, with Napoli among his admirers, while the midfielder also made a request to leave the club on loan for more first-team opportunities. But it appears that an exit in any guise will not be completed.",
      "Boss Ruben Amorim made his feelings very clear on the youngster’s future ahead of the weekend’s win against Burnley. He said: \"I want Kobbie to stay. He needs to fight for his place, and we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change.",
      "“I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "Mainoo broke into United first-team squad during the 2022/23 campaign and he has gone on to make 74 appearances for the club and scored seven goals. But he has made just one Premier League outing so far this season.",
      "Mainoo has two years left on his contract at Old Trafford, with club chiefs keen to tie him down to a new deal. But so far an agreement has not been forthcoming.",
      "While Mainoo looks set to stay where he is for now, the same cannot be said of a number of his teammates. Alejandro Garnacho has already completed a £40m move to Premier League rivals Chelsea.",
      "Striker Rasmus Hojlund also has interest from Napoli and a deal could be signed off before Monday evening’s 7pm deadline. Work also remains ongoing over Antony’s move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Real Betis remain keen to re-sign the Brazilian winger following his successful loan move last season. Terms have been thrashed out over a €25m (£21.65m) permanent switch.",
      "Away from outgoings, United are still keen on adding a new goalkeeper to their squad. They have identified Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens as a priority target and have agreed a £18.2m fee with the Belgian side.",
      "That has seen United abandon their interest in Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez, who now looks set to stay in the Midlands for the time being. The Argentine has not played in any of Villa’s opening three Premier League games of the season.",

      "Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer have slammed Ruben Amorim's decision to turn away during Manchester United penalties. The Red Devils crashed out of the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town following a tense shootout.",
      "Meanwhile, Bruno Fernandes saved the game against Burnley, sealing a 3-2 win in United's favour thanks to a coolly converted spot kick. Amorim faced fierce criticism after his team's shock cup elimination, with the boss's choice to avoid watching United's penalties only intensifying the backlash.",
      "The United manager witnessed his team throw away the lead twice against Burnley at the weekend before Fernandes delivered in the 97th minute. Yet Amorim's touchline conduct has drawn condemnation from Lineker and Shearer after he similarly turned away from the decisive goal at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker said: \"I don't think I've been particularly critical of Amorim because I think it's a difficult job. I think the club's in a bit of a pickle and it generally filters down from the top, as we've said many times, and I think he's probably a very good coach.",
      "\"He's probably come into a situation which he didn't realise before he took the job. But, I have to say this, if you're the manager or coach of a side and you hide in the dugout and not be prepared to watch your own players, some of them very young players, take penalties. I honestly... I mean, come on.",
      "\"This is the second or third round of the Carabao Cup for crying out loud! Do me a favour. That's not leadership. Leadership is, you've got to stand up and be there for your players. I think that's really important.\"",
      "Co-host Shearer agreed with Lineker's sentiments as the Premier League icon said: \"I thought that was a terrible look, him cowering away in the dugout, leaving some young players, some players that are making their first starts. Like everyone else, I thought it was an awful look for a manager to sit there hiding.\"",
      "Discussing United's recent triumph over Burnley, Shearer added: \"He did the same yesterday. He wasn't watching when Bruno was taking the penalty yesterday in the last minute. Slightly different, I guess.\"",
      "The victory against Burnley has seen United amass four points from their initial three league matches. On the transfer front, United are reportedly finalising a deal for goalkeeper Senne Lammens, amid the less-than-stellar beginnings for Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana this season.",
      "Nonetheless, Lineker couldn't shake off Amorim's approach to penalties in United's recent fixtures. The former Match of the Day host defended the manager when he faced ridicule for using a tactics board during the Grimsby match, yet he contends that Amorim is projecting the wrong image to his squad regarding penalties.",
      "He said: \"I had no issue with the tactics board thing because they all have certain ways of doing the tactics, some notes and stuff. That was fine. I just think not watching your team take penalties, even if it's a superstition... I mean, no. I'm sorry.\"",
      "Lineker also expressed his bafflement at former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's habit of looking away during penalty shootouts, explaining: \"I know Klopp sometimes didn't watch penalties but I don't get it. I'll say the same about Klopp.",
      "\"I never really understood that because, well, it ain't going to change it for a start. Also you need to see what your players are doing. It's something that I can't quite get my head around.\"",
      "As the Premier League gears up to return following the international break, Amorim's squad is set to face Manchester City on Sunday 14 September. Pep Guardiola's side is coming off back-to-back league defeats against Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton and Hove Albion, following an emphatic victory over Wolves in their season opener.",

      "Kolo Muani was a big hit at Frankfurt, eventually convincing PSG to spend a mammoth £76million to secure his services several years ago. The Frenchman has struggled to deliver and is poised to enjoy another loan move, this time in north London with Thomas Frank.",
      "The forward previously had a stint at Juventus and is not currently part of the plan in Paris with Tottenham looking to take advantage as a result. Kolo Muani, at his best, has proven to be an elite performer and the Premier League outfit will hope to get him back to his previous level.",
      "There is no obligation for Tottenham to buy the 26-year-old, who scored 10 times during his stint in Italy last term. The Athletic reports that personal terms have been agreed and Kolo Muani is heading to London for a medical.",
      "United were tracking the Frenchman backed when Erik ten Hag was in the midst of his second summer of recruitment. The Dutch manager had won a trophy and got into the top four and optimism was growing as the Manchester outfit sought more firepower.",
      "Ten Hag considered making a move for Kolo Muani, but later decided the better option was to invest in Rasmus Hojlund. The young Dane had impressed at Atalanta and £72m was spent to secure his signature despite him being far from the finished article.",
      "It is a gamble that has not paid off and Hojlund has struggled to deliver and towards the end of last season looked hugely bereft of confidence. He only managed to score four leagues goals in 2024/25 and is now pushing to complete a loan move to Napoli.",
      "The loan agreement may reportedly include a clause that would allow the Italian champions to sign Hojlund permanently for £38m if certain conditions are met - one being Champions League qualification. That could still represent a loss of more than £30m.",
      "It is another example of those at Old Trafford making poor decisions in the transfer market and later paying for it financially. Antony is set to leave for Real Betis for around a quarter of what United paid for him only three years ago. Jadon Sancho too could represent a huge loss if he does leave.",

      "His subsequent loan move to Chelsea the following year proved even more disappointing for the forward, scoring only once in 12 competitive matches for the Blues before returning to Ligue 1. While many supporters won't recall Falcao with the same affection reserved for legends like Ruud van Nistelrooy or Wayne Rooney, it's evident that fellow players hold an admiration for his achievements on the field.",

      "Tony Mowbray is bewildered by Ruben Amorim's decision to utilise Amad as a right wing-back. The Manchester United boss was thrown a lifeline this summer, as the hierarchy supported him with signings and gave him a full pre-season to right last season's wrongs.",
      "The Red Devils endured a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term, with Amorim being conservative with his expenditure in the January transfer window, while reshaping the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag. However, the 40-year-old has certainly compensated for missed opportunities this summer, splashing out over £200million on a fresh attacking trio of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, with expectations of enhanced displays for his first full season on the sidelines.",
      "Following Mbeumo's arrival on the right flank, Amorim has opted to position Amad as a wing-back, despite the youngster's obvious talents lying in his offensive capabilities rather than defensive duties. And it's a decision that has left Mowbray perplexed.",
      "Speaking on No Tippy Tappy Football, the 61-year-old said: \"In my opinion, and can I say this from a position of total humility that he's manager of Manchester United, who am I? Who am I to tell him what to do? But in my stomach, it feels like you don't have to play 5-4-1, whatever you want to call it.",
      "\"You don't have to do it. If the group of players is screaming at you to play a three-man midfield to protect the mobility of a Casemiro if you want to play him or whoever it might be. You maybe have to put an extra man in there, so why would you be so stuck on one system and trying to force Amad as a right wing-back?",
      "\"Amad who's a brilliant footballer, Man United class I would suggest. I speak to Gary Pallister a lot about this when we sit and have coffee near my street most days. Amad, he's a genius.",
      "\"I talked about not having to look at the ball, the ball's stuck to his left foot. He is a brilliant football player, and a brilliant human being. And you're playing him at right wing-back just to fit into your system.\"",
      "\"He should be bending it in the top corner with his left foot, he should be sitting people on their backside and scoring wonderful goals like I know he can. Why's he chasing people into his own box playing right wing-back?\"",
      "A fan favourite on both flanks, Amad was the starting right wing-back for Manchester United in their draw against Fulham and win over Burnley, causing quite a stir among football enthusiasts globally. However, with Mbeumo's versatility as either a winger or a centre forward, the 23-year-old might struggle to secure playing time in his favoured position this season.",

      "Manchester United moved to address their goalkeeper crisis on deadline day by agreeing to sign Senne Lammens for £18.2million plus add-ons. United decided to recruit a new No.1 after costly mistakes from Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana at the start of the season - with Lammens the preferred choice.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgium youth international travelled to Manchester to complete his move from Royal Antwerp and has agreed a five-year deal with United. United also considered a move for Aston Villa's 32-year-old keeper, Emiliano Martinez, but decided on Lammens because of his younger profile.",
      "Martinez would also have cost United twice as much as Lammens and would have demanded wages in the region of £200,000-a-week. Against that backdrop, and with United needing to spend cautiously to comply with PSR rules having already spent more than £200m this this summer, Lammens was considered the best option.",
      "There is no sell-on clause in the deal agreed for Lammens, who United view as a goalkeeper who can grow into the role as first-choice and become a mainstay in the team for a number of years. Lammens is set to make his United debut in the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium a week on Sunday.",
      "With the arrival of Lammens, United have four senior keepers on their books in Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton. Sources close to Onana have said he intends to stay and fight for the No.1 spot which makes it likely Bayindir will go out on loan for the rest of the season or seek a permanent switch.",
      "The Turkish shot-stopper started all three of United's league matches before the international break while Onana was given the Carabao Cup game at Grimsby. Bayindir's errors at home to Arsenal and Burnley either side of his struggles away to Fulham failed to convince Ruben Amorim that he was good enough to remain No.1 beyond the transfer window.",
      "Meanwhile, Onana had a nightmare against Grimsby Town. The Cameroonian was at fault for the League Two side's second goal and was weak in the penalty shootout.",
      "After Saturday's 3-2 victory over Burnley, United's first win of the season, Amorim launched a passionate defence of his goalkeepers, despite privately seeking a new one. \"Guys, they are humans,\" the Red Devils boss said.",
      "\"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",

      "Ten Hag's only win at Leverkusen came in the DFB-Pokal, with his side sat 12th in the league after failing to win either of their opening two fixtures. At Old Trafford, it felt things couldn't get any worse for Ten Hag after leading United to what was then their record-lowest Premier League finish – but they just have.",

      "Some may have felt those same pangs of regret after reading Ten Hag's address to the fans following his dismissal. The former Ajax and Utrecht chief penned an open letter to United's supporters soon after he was sacked, detailing just what it meant to represent the Red Devils during his two-year tenure.",

Whether it was at a game far away or a tough match at Old Trafford, your support has been unshakeable. The atmosphere at Old Trafford has always been electrifying, thanks to you.\"",

      "The former has yet to release a similar statement regarding his dismissal from the BayArena. Leverkusen managing director Simon Rolfes said \"nobody wanted to take this step\" but that persevering with the current setup was unfeasible.",
      "\"A parting of ways at this early stage of the season is painful, but we felt it was necessary,\" added Leverkusen chief executive Fernando Carro. \"We remain committed to achieving our goals for the season – and to do that, we need the best possible conditions at all levels and across the entire first team. Now it’s a matter of fully implementing and utilising these conditions again.\"",

On one hand it presents clubs with an opportunity to plug gaps that may have emerged in the early weeks of the season, but it also means managers are having to deal with questions over their players.",

      "Premier League clubs previously voted in favour of closing the transfer window before the start of the domestic season in 2017 - and it came into affect ahead of the 2018/19 campaign. However it quickly backfired as the major European leagues chose to stick with the status quo and that allowed them to go after Premier League players - with clubs then unable to sign replacements.",
      "Jurgen Klopp was among those to bemoan the situation as he said: \"I don't care when it closes, I only think it must close at the same time (as the rest of Europe). When they spoke about 'Let's finish it before the season starts then everyone knows their squad' - that's a good idea. But then the rest didn't do it and that makes no sense.",
      "\"Can somebody explain what is the benefit for the Premier League? We don't really have a problem but for other teams, their key players are still on the market and everything can happen. You want a team not only together but together and focused on the future, but that is not possible as long as there is a door open.\"",
      "If De Gea's suggestion was bought back in then a number of clubs, including his former one, would've been left carrying a number of players who do not want to be at the club. Antony's exit is close whilst Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia could still secure moves away from Old Trafford. Ruben Amorim is also looking to land a new goalkeeper, likely to be Senne Lammens.",
      "A number of other big names have haggled for moves, none more so than Alexander Isak. Had the transfer window shut just over a fortnight ago then Alexander Isak would've had to accept his fate of staying at Newcastle. Instead he's due to move to Liverpool in a club-record deal.",
      "An early close to the transfer window would encourage clubs to get their business done early - and end the franticness of deadline day. However the issue of failing to align with Europe would remain, unless all leagues agreed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jadon Sancho will love what Marcus Rashford previously said about his own loan spell at Aston Villa, as the Manchester United winger gets set to head there himself. Sancho is now poised to join Villa on a season-long loan, after the out-of-favour star was placed in Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad' during pre-season, alongside Tyrell Malacia, Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "For now, Malacia is the only one left at Old Trafford; with Rashford on loan to Barcelona, Garnacho sealing a £40million switch to Chelsea last week, and Sancho on his way to Villa on deadline day.",
      "The 25-year-old will likely call upon his old United and England team-mate for advice about working under Unai Emery. Rashford spent the latter half of the 2024/25 season on loan to Villa, and made a real stamp on the team during his limited time.",
      "Upon joining, Rashford admitted how he had \"a few clubs\" approach him, but choosing Villa was \"an easy decision\".",
      "He added: \"I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions. I just want to play football and am excited to get started.\"",
      "The Manchester-born star shone in the Champions League for Villa, while scoring four times across all competitions and making a big difference in Emery's front line.",
      "However, injury eventually hampered his time in the west Midlands and he returned to United for a brief period in the summer, before heading overseas to join Barcelona. When saying his goodbyes to the Villa supporters, Rashford's words could be of some comfort to Sancho as he heads to Birmingham for the season.",
      "Writing on social media at the time, Rashford said: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me. It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch.",
      "\"Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "Rashford also initially saw his fitness and goalscoring prowess improve while at Villa, as he commented on his confidence returning following the team's 3-0 victory over Preston North End that sent them to the FA Cup semi-finals.",
      "After scoring a brace in that game, the 27-year-old said: \"It's a great feeling, I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. It's obviously nice for a forward to get a goal so hopefully it continues.",
      "\"I think we have to just take it one game at a time and give it 100 percent on the pitch and see where it takes us. We're a very ambitious team – we want to win and try and get as far as we can in all competitions and we also want to push to get back into the top four.\"",
      "Sancho will benefit from hearing Rashford's words ahead of his straight loan move to United's Premier League rivals, given that he struggled for form before Amorim even arrived.",
      "In his 83 appearances for the club since he joined, the winger has scored 12 goals and assisted six times, with his most recent stint in red coming in a penalty shootout defeat to Manchester City in the Community Shield, where he played seven minutes and missed his spot-kick.",
      "Meanwhile, Emi Martinez has been looking at going the other way from Villa to United. But the Red Devils have now reportedly agreed a deal for Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens, which may well push Martinez out of Amorim's plans for the upcoming season – but anything could happen on deadline day.",

      "Manchester United paid a world-record fee for a teenager when bringing Anthony Martial to Old Trafford on deadline day 2015, but the Red Devils were later able to save some money on the forward. Martial arrived from Monaco for an initial £36million, with the deal potentially rising to £57.6m.",
      "There was hope that Martial could be the prospect to ignite the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, even if United boss Louis van Gaal believed the club had overpaid for the forward. His debut goal against Liverpool, combined with numerous comparisons to Thierry Henry, only added more fuel to the fire.",
      "Martial ended his debut season with 11 league goals, but would only better that tally once before he left the club in 2024. Although he ultimately failed to fulfil his potential at United, the excitement surrounding the Frenchman was summed up by a contract clause dependent on Martial being shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or, which saved United £7.2m.",
      "Martial signing for £36m broke the record fee for a teenager that had been set by his team-mate Luke Shaw's move from Southampton the previous year. However, Monaco included three transfer clauses in the deal, each worth £7.2m, which could have seen the club earn an additional £21.6m.",
      "The first objective to be achieved was Martial scoring 25 league goals by the end of the 2018/19 season. His bright start to life at Old Trafford suggested this would not be a problem, but Martial's subsequent inconsistent form meant the £7.2m was not paid until October 2018.",
      "The second clause rested on the striker earning 25 caps for France. He made his international debut soon after signing for United and featured 30 times for Les Bleus between 2015 and 2021.",
      "United were spared from paying the final £7.2m, though, as Martial was never among the nominees for the Ballon d'Or. He came closest during the 2019/20 campaign, scoring 23 goals in all competitions, but struggled to rediscover that form before leaving the club as a free agent last year. It meant that United paid £50.4m in total for Martial, who scored 90 goals in 317 appearances.",
      "While Martial showed early signs of promise, Van Gaal was honest in his belief that United had been overcharged. A short time after the deal had been finalised, the Dutch coach explained that the forward had been bought more for the next United manager.",
      "\"It was a ridiculous amount of money, but it's the crazy world we are in,\" Van Gaal told executive United season ticket holders in 2015. \"United are routinely quoted £10m more for a player, but I have not bought Martial for me. I have bought him for the next manager of Manchester United.\" He later suggested he would be succeeded by his assistant coach, Ryan Giggs.",
      "However, Van Gaal was replaced by Jose Mourinho in 2016, and Marial began to lose some of his early momentum, with the striker later accusing the manager of disrespect. It wasn't until the arrival of United hero Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that Martial began to remind fans of his potential, though he was unable to sustain his top form beyond a single season.",
      "After Solskjaer left the Red Devils in November 2021, Martial fell out of favour with interim boss Ralf Rangnick. He was loaned out to Sevilla in January, scoring once in 12 appearances. In his two years under Erik ten Hag, Martial scored 11 goals in 48 games.",
      "This was not what Monaco had envisioned when selling the young forward to Old Trafford. He had been expected to meet all of the club's transfer clauses, including being shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "In 2015, Monaco president Vadim Vasilyev announced: \"The price for Martial is £57.6million, but take into account this sum includes bonuses, which are very realistic.\"",
      "United released Martial at the end of his contract last year, ending his nine-year stint at Old Trafford. The 29-year-old later joined Greek side AEK Athens, where he scored nine goals in 23 games across all competitions last season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Aston Villa have agreed a loan deal for Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho. The 25-year-old is set for a switch that will see him spend the remainder of the 2025-26 season at Villa Park.",
      "Sancho had started Monday looking likely to remain at Old Trafford, one of two members of Manchester United's 'Bomb Squad' still banished from the first-team squad at the club's Carrington training ground - the other being Tyrell Malacia. Now Villa, who have been restricted by their need to adhere to UEFA financial regulations during the summer, are pushing to get a deal over the line after a breakthrough with the player's camp.",
      "They have been looking for a wide player to replace Leon Bailey, since his loan move to Roma, and have turned to Sancho who is in the final year of his United contract, although they do have an option to extend. Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, where he made 41 appearances, before they paid United £5m NOT to sign him permanently, having initially agreed a £25m obligation as part of his loan deal.",
      "Sancho currently earns just over £200k-a-week at United, having incurred a 25 percent pay cut due to the club's lack of Champions League football. That is a figure United are keen to get off their books and is one that Villa are more able to take up - they'll pay roughly 80 percent plus a small loan fee -, particularly as United look to take Emi Martinez to be their new No.1.",
      "But they're now back in after members of the club's hierarchy moved to sanction a costly short-term solution with Martinez instead of planning for the future with Royal Antwerp’s highly-coveted young stopper Senne Lammens, whom the club's goalkeeping scout, Tony Coton, has been pushing for.",
      "However, United's top brass feel that signing the former Arsenal keeper is a gamble they have to take, even though the club are flirting with PSR problems having already spent more than £200million on new signings this summer. Martinez was left out of the Villa team by a furious Unai Emery for the 3-0 defeat by Crystal Palace on Sunday, with the two sides looking to get a deal done.",
      "If they can't, then the door is still open for Lammens to complete his move.",

      "Erik ten Hag has been sacked by Bayer Leverkusen after just two Bundesliga games in charge. The job in Germany was his first since being dismissed by Manchester United, but it has been short lived.",
      "Ten Hag saw his side lose their opener against Hoffenheim before drawing to Werder Bremen at the weekend and the club's hierarchy have opted for a change. The Dutchman's pre-season had not inspired confidence as the squad came to terms with a number of key departures.",
      "The ex-Ajax boss was looking to rebuild his reputation in Germany but, after winning in the first round of the German Cup, he picked up just one point from a possible six.",
      "Leverkusen surrendered a two-goal lead against ten-man Bremen at the weekend to leave with just a point and, despite having little time to implement his ideas, Ten Hag has been shown the door.",
      "A club statement read: \"Bayer 04 Leverkusen have parted ways with head coach Erik ten Hag. This was decided by the shareholders' committee, the club’s supervisory body, on the recommendation of the management of Bayer 04. Training will be overseen by the current backroom staff on an interim basis.\"",
      "Captain Robert Andrich said after their Bremen collapse: “If we lead 3-1 and are a man up, we must take three points. We were too wild and made many mistakes after the sending-off. We must start playing as a team immediately, otherwise we won’t win any matches.\"",
      "The German club's hierarchy refused to back their manager after their collapse at the weekend, which was seen as a damning sign, and are again looking for a new manager having seen the hugely successful Xabi Alonso leave for Real Madrid in the summer.",
      "Leverkusen have seen the likes of Jeremie Frimpong, Granit Xhaka and Florian Wirtz leave the club this summer, recouping huge fees, but leaving them lacking in quality and Ten Hag ultimately paid the price.",
      "It is another major blow for the ex-United boss, who saw his tenure in Manchester end poorly. He was controversially backed after winning the FA Cup in 2024 but it quickly became apparent that the Ineos bosses needed to make a change and he was sacked in October last year.",
      "Ten Hag also copped criticism for his transfer record, which saw him spend more than £600m on the likes of Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana - only to see them all fail to hit expectation. Several of his signings are already being ushered out of the club.",

Aston Villa goalkeeper Martinez was left out of Unai Emery's squad on Sunday that lost 3-0 to Crystal Palace, with the manager confirming he wasn't \"focused\" on the game due to a possible transfer.",
      "While Ruben Amorim insists he is happy with his options of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, the pace is picking up on the World Cup-winning 'keeper making a last minute move to Manchester. However, Martinez won't be pleased that the Portuguese manager has gotten rid of one of his international teammates, following Garnacho's £40million move to Chelsea.",
      "Back when the young winger made his debut for Argentina in June 2023, the shot-stopper was full of praise for Garnacho's capabilities both on and off the field. Speaking to TyC Sports at the time, he said: \"He is a very humble guy. He came to work; he didn't talk a lot.",
      "\"He is very eager to play. The truth is that he's a little treasure and I hope we can mould him so that he gives us as much as Angel Di Maria.\"",
      "So while Martinez may be saddened by Garnacho's move away from the club he could potentially join in the next few hours, he still has a familiar face in front of him in United's backline. During Argentina's famous World Cup win in 2022, the heroic 'keeper dubbed Lisandro Martinez an \"animal\", as the pair helped their country to their third trophy of its kind - and the first since 1986.",
      "The defender has been out of the United squad with a cruciate knee ligament injury since last season, but is targeting a return to the field after the international break.",

While the 'keeper did save one spot kick, he failed to keep two goals out of United's net in regular time, and has since been dropped in favour of Bayindir once more.",
      "The Turkish star has started all three of United's Premier League games, but he hasn't instilled confidence with his performances so far. Bayindir has conceded four goals in three matches, including two from a newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has told Manchester United what they will be missing out on after completing a transfer to Chelsea. Garnacho has joined Chelsea in a £40million move from United, where he was pushed out by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The 21-year-old winger fell out with the United boss at the end of last season, having reacted furiously to being left on the bench for the Europa League final. He was then left out of the squad for United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season and told he was not in Amorim’s plans for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Garnacho was placed in the ‘bomb squad’ along with fellow unwanted players Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Having been forced to train alone, the Argentina international has now followed Rashford out of the door at Old Trafford and is delighted to be at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Enzo Maresca was key to making the deal happen and it seems there is no love lost between Garnacho and his former club. While he has shared lots of Chelsea content on his social media pages since joining on the weekend, there is no goodbye message to United.",
      "And having contributed 11 goals and 10 assists in 58 games last season, Garnacho was keen to rub their noses in it during his first interview with Chelsea. “I have a winning mentality. I have passion and a big personality. It’s a natural fit with a club like Chelsea, which have just won the Club World Cup,” he said.",
      "“Chelsea are at the top now, and it’s important to fight for the club like the fans deserve. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special – it means we’re the best team in the world!",
      "“It’s not common to have played a lot of games at this age, but it has helped me a lot. I’m only 21 and I have a lot of experience from these different types of games, stadiums and moments.”",
      "Garnacho joined United from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and scored 26 goals in 144 appearances after progressing through the academy. He was once considered the future of the club, having been nurtured by his idol Cristiano Ronaldo and performed impressively at such a young age.",
      "But his falling out with Amorim meant there was no way back and he has signed a seven-year contract at Chelsea. The Blues first showed an interest in January and his agents, Carlos Cambeiro and Quique de Lucas, were spotted at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Chelsea feel they have secured a bargain given Garnacho’s youth and potential and he will compete with the likes of Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, Tyrique George and Estevao for a place in Maresca’s starting line-up.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have finally agreed a deal to sell Antony to Real Betis, with the winger set to return to the club he spend the second half of last season on loan at. Antony joined United from Ajax for an initial £81.3million back in 2022, but has struggled to make much of an impact.",
      "The Brazilian managed just 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances across all competitions and United are now set to cut their losses. Antony has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim and was keen on a return to Betis after finding form during his loan spell.",
      "Now, after the furore of the weekend, a £21.5m deal has been struck after an agreement was reached over Antony's salary. The deal also includes potential add-ons worth around £2.6m and a clause that will see United bank 50 per cent of any profit Betis make by selling Antony. The 25-year-old is set to take a major pay cut, with the winger having two years left on his £6m-a-year deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The deal hit the skids over the weekend due to money owed to the player on the remaining two years of his deal - with both Betis and United not wanting to pay. United did not want to pay Antony any more money and the club have now got their way. They will make no further payment to the player' with Antony having to do his bit to seal his return to Betis.",
      "\"As I said, I wanted to do things, but they didn't seem to work out because I wasn't happy, I didn't feel that desire to play football, and I needed to find myself and be happy again because playing football was always something I loved.",

      "\"Only I know what it was like to be there at home, not having the strength to even play with my son, going days without eating, staying locked in my room. So, for me it was very complicated, but thank God, with the help of my family and mainly with the help of God, I managed to get ahead and today I am very happy here.\"",

      "Unai Emery showed his frustration with Emi Martinez during a bizarre pre-match interview on the eve of transfer deadline day.",
      "Martinez was left out of the Aston Villa squad for their Premier League game against Crystal Palace on Sunday night amid speculation he could leave for Manchester United. The Argentina international has been linked with a transfer all summer and things came to a head on the weekend.",
      "Emery opted to leave Martinez out of the squad entirely, with summer signing Marco Bizot starting in goal. It proved to be an ill-fated decision, with Bizot conceding a penalty for a foul on Daichi Kamada as Palace eased to a 3-0 win at Villa Park.",
      "In awkward scenes, Emery left long pauses as he stuck to his unusual approach. Asked where Martinez was, he replied: \"Marco Bizot!\" Asked whether Bizot would be the Villa goalkeeper going forward, he declined to add anything else, just repeating his name once more before stating \"your time is over\" and walking off.",
      "After the game was over, and Villa had suffered a damaging home defeat, Emery did admit that the situation needed resolving. \"It is not helping us. One of the circumstances not helping,\" he said.",
      "\"We will see how we close the transfer window. We have a lot of circumstances that are not helping us be mentally like we were last year.\"",
      "Asked why Martinez was left out, Emery replied: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent. He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Martinez, United and Villa are in a three-way tussle which also involves Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens. United have been in talks with Antwerp over a deal for their 23-year-old goalkeeper. It was reported on Sunday that United had tabled an improved offer for the player ahead of Monday night's transfer deadline.",
      "But Lammens has also been linked with Villa, who are looking at their options for if Martinez does leave. It is an intriguing situation which has come about largely because of the shaky performances of both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana for United this season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has insisted he is happy with his options in between the posts, but United are pursuing a deadline day deal nonetheless. Villa, meanwhile, have been hamstrung by profit and sustainability rules and have been quiet this summer in the window.",

      "Raheem Sterling swapped one London club for another at the last minute in 2024, allowing Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to escape Old Trafford and head to Chelsea. Last year's deadline day was full of surprises in the Premier League, with Chelsea's dramatic dealings sparking plenty of headlines.",
      "Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal, and United saw Sancho and Sterling move to different parts of London on loan for the new campaign. As the transfer window slammed shut, the Blues released a small statement confirming Sterling's departure, which simply read, \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger - who is now 30 years old and back at Stamford Bridge - completed a last-minute loan switch to the Emirates Stadium. This was after it became clear he was not part of manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club throughout the summer.",
      "Chelsea saw another new addition to their squad: the arrival of former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially was swapped in for Sterling. The England international was also left out of then-boss Erik ten Hag's plans at United and had been free to depart either on loan or on a permanent deal.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the chosen location for the young attacker, as United agreed to an obligation to buy price of £23million if certain targets were met. That was a far cry from the £73.5m that the club paid back in the summer of 2021 to lure Sancho to Manchester, but he hardly pulled up trees at Old Trafford, registering just 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances, subsequently seeing his stock fall dramatically.",
      "Meanwhile, Sterling was reunited with an old friend at Arsenal; boss Mikel Arteta, who spent a lot of time working under Pep Guardiola during the forward's seven-year tenure with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the end of the 2024/25 season regardless of his impact in north London.",
      "During his time at Arsenal, the forward managed just one goal and assisted five times in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League. Sterling was used sparingly and arguably enjoyed his best game when he helped Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice score in a 2-2 draw with PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's elite competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but ultimately finished the season without silverware and barely any game time before heading back to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Meanwhile, Sancho had a more impactful year with Chelsea, scoring five goals and assisting 10 times across 41 appearances both domestically and in Europe. Most of the young winger's goals came in the Premier League, but it was in the knockout stages of the Conference League where he shone the most for the Blues.",
      "After making the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund while on loan in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho made yet another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, and they dispatched the Spanish club in style, winning 4-1 with Sancho scoring the third in the 83rd minute of the game.",
      "However, Chelsea opted not to pay a fee to United to avoid having to trigger Sancho's buyout clause, having failed to be convinced by the winger despite his role in helping them claim silverware.",
      "Now, Sancho is part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still trying to secure a move away for the winger as he is not part of the Portuguese manager's plans for the future.",
      "Sancho has already turned down moves to Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly wanted by several clubs, while Sterling is also unwanted at Chelsea. With both players in difficult positions at their clubs, there's every chance they could one again be involved in a dramatic deadline day move, and will hope this time they can make more of an impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho is closing in on a season-long loan to Aston Villa.",
      "Sancho has been looking for a new club since Chelsea decided to break their obligation to sign him permanently. Villa have made an awful start to the season and are set to sign Sancho on deadline day.",
      "Villa have agreed to cover 80 per cent of Sancho's wages, but the deal includes achievable bonuses, which essentially means his full wages should be covered during his stint in Birmingham.",
      "United will also receive a loan fee for Sancho, who will leave on deadline day for a successive summer.",
      "Sancho will follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Villa in the January transfer window after a breakdown in his relationship with Ruben Amorim.",
      "Former United defender Victor Lindelof is also set to sign for Villa on a free transfer.",
      "Sancho has trained on his own at Carrington since reporting for pre-season in July. Chelsea paid a £5m penalty to break their obligation to sign the winger and Roma were later in discussions to sign him.",
      "Roma proposed a season-long loan with an obligation to Sancho for £20million next summer. United were happy with their proposal, but Sancho failed to agree personal terms.",
      "United signed Sancho from Borussia Dortmund for £72.8million in the summer of 2021 and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer suggested he could become an elite player at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at United.",
      "However, Sancho contributed 12 goals and six assists in 83 appearances for United before his fallout with Erik ten Hag. He missed four months of competitive football due to that disagreement and re-signed for Dortmund on loan for the second half of 2023/2024 in an attempt to rediscover form.",
      "Chelsea subsequently signed Sancho on loan at the eleventh hour of last summer's transfer deadline day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

United would have under nine hours to sign a midfield replacement and, at this stage, it is improbable that they would decide to let Mainoo go when they have been digging their heels in.",
      "Mainoo also played one-and-a-half games last week, having been unused in the opening two matches. He failed his test of nerve by seeking a loan move but figures at United sympathise with his situation, despite his inability to get into the worst United team in 51 years.",
      "Speaking to some United fans, they've taken a dim view of Mainoo. An interesting sub-plot is whether United will continue to allow his agent, David Lockwood, a route to representing some of their academy players. That is causing a minor issue with some in the agency industry.",

      "However, after suffering an injury in pre-season, Onana has failed to regain his spot in the Premier League starting line-up. Altay Bayindir has been preferred in the opening three top flight fixtures with the Cameroonian struggling in his only start at League Two Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Bayindir has not been setting the world alight in place of Onana and was at fault for the goal against Arsenal on the opening day. Therefore, it appears that United are moving to bolster their goalkeeper department.",
      "Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez appears to be the top target and Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens is also thought to be on the radar too. But if one or both of the goalkeepers were to sign on deadline day, inevitably exits would need to take place.",
      "However, with the deadline fast approaching, United are unlikely to be rushing to sell today. While Onana and Bayindir could both leave, they do not necessarily have to exit today.",
      "That is because the transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey are both open beyond today. Those markets shut on September 10 and 11 respectively which gives United time.",
      "Bayindir returning to his home country could be an easier deal to accomplish than selling Onana. He is unlikely to leave for Fenerbahce though unless their move for Ederson falls through on deadline day.",

      "Manchester United will not sign goalkeeper Abdulla Al-Hammadi on a free transfer.",
      "Abdulla Al-Hammadi has been on trial at Carrington for over a month now. United gave serious consideration to signing him as a training goalkeeper and the player was under the impression he would be offered a deal, but the final decision has been made not to offer him a contract.",
      "The 20-year-old was at Leigh Sports Village for the Under-21 Manchester derby on Sunday.",
      "Al-Hammadi also recently travelled to the Riverside Stadium for the U21s' win against Middlesbrough.",
      "Al-Hammadi was on trial with Everton in March and he kept a clean sheet for the Toffees' U21s against Bolton Wanderers B in a test game at the newly-built Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "That meant Al-Hammadi became the first goalkeeper to keep out the opposition at Everton's new stadium. He shared photos of himself in action at the 52,888-capacity arena with the caption: “Grateful for every opportunity.”",
      "Al-Hammadi previously played for United Arab Emirates Pro League side Al Wasl. The young shot-stopper has captained UAE Under-18s, but he explored opportunities in Britain this year.",
      "United weighed up signing Al-Hammadi as a training goalkeeper/academy signing, but the youngster will now have look for an opportunity elsewhere for the next step of his career.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof has secured a new club on transfer deadline day after agreeing to join Premier League rivals Aston Villa.",
      "Lindelof arrived at Old Trafford in 2017 having been signed by Jose Mourinho from Benfica. He would go on to make 284 appearances for the club, winning both the FA and Carabao Cup during his stint in the north west.",
      "However, after being overlooked by both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, the decision was made to end his eight-year association with the Reds at the expiry of his contract. Despite becoming a free agent, Lindelof had not managed to secure his next club until today with Unai Emery's side completing the signing.",
      "For Lindelof, the ability to remain in the Premier League will likely have been a priority due to having a young family which has grown in Manchester. In May, Lindelof's wife Maja conducted an emotional interview with the magazine Elle about her and her husband's future.",
      "\"I’m prepared to sit with a baby, hormonal, and just cry while I maybe pack my bags and say goodbye to my whole life,\" she explained about Lindelof's departure from Old Trafford. \"Manchester is our children’s only home, so it will be really tough for everyone.\"",
      "Fortunately for Lindelof and his family, a move to Villa means it is plausable that they can stay in their home in the north west. It was noted when Marcus Rashford joined Villa on loan in January, he did not relocate to Birmingham because he was able to commute.",
      "Discussing his move to the club, Lindelof told Villa's media channels: \"It is a massive club and I was super excited when I heard that the club wanted me. I spoke to my wife and we thought it was a good move for my family.",
      "\"I am thrilled to be part of this squad. Hopefully I can help the younger players with my experience and also bring the quality I can show on the pitch.",
      "\"Building from the back is one of my strengths, so that’s something I can help the team with. I want to go out there and help the team, win as many matches as possible.",
      "\"I want to win and I feel that we have a great squad. We can do good things.\"",
      "The Reds will be travelling to Villa on December 20 before hosting Lindelof's new team on March 14.",

      "Manchester United are on the verge of completing the signing of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day.",
      "His arrival will almost definitely see either Altay Bayindir or Andre Onana leave, at some stage. United are unlikely to harbour four goalkeepers in their squad and Tom Heaton is set to stay having only signed a new deal during the summer transfer window.",
      "With Lammens due to be brought in today, the talk will turn to the number he shall be given. Onana and Bayindir have both represented United this season and cannot be stripped of their numbers.",
      "If Bayindir was to leave, the No.1 would be free, which is often the first-choice of a stopper. Currently, the Belgian wears the No.91 for Royal Antwerp which is unsurprisingly available at present.",
      "However, if United were to conduct a brutal decision, they could give Lammens the same number as he wears for the Belgium national team; No.12. That number is currently held by Tyrell Malacia who is part of the five-man 'bomb squad' who requested to leave Old Trafford earlier in the summer.",
      "If Lammens requested the No.12 shirt, then he would likely receive it - due to the precedent that has already been set this summer. Marcus Rashford had the No.10 shirt stripped from him prior to the start of the new campaign and it was given to Matheus Cunha instead.",
      "Malacia looks set to be staying at United for the time being. His move to La Liga side Elche on loan is believed to have collapsed and the full-back appears to be without options as the deadline closes in.",
      "The Dutchman can still move to Saudi Arabia or Turkey after the 7pm deadline. Their windows shut on September 10 and 11 respectively.",

      "Ennis spent the last six months of last term on loan with Doncaster Rovers as they secured promotion from League Two. He will now join Fleetwood on a season-long deal.",
      "The youngster will be available to make his Fleetwood debut on Tuesday night and there is no option to make the move permanent included in the deal. Plymouth Argyle made an offer to sign Ennis on loan for 2025/2026, but the decision was made to sign for Fleetwood ahead of the transfer deadline.",
      "Ennis was given a new two-year United contract last summer as his previous deal expired in 2025.",
      "Although Ennis has played in each attacking position for the academy, it's thought his long-term future will be on the left wing and he is building a reputation as a goalscoring winger.",
      "Ennis began his career with rivals Liverpool, but he was signed by United in the summer of 2021 and he was the standout signing for the academy in an otherwise quiet window.",
      "The youngster signed his first professional contract immediately after celebrating his 17th birthday and only the most highly regarded academy talents are given pro deals so quickly.",
      "However, disaster struck in August 2022 when it was confirmed that he'd ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee. Ennis faced a long road to recovery after that injury but he made up for lost time after that 14-month lay-off and has quickly got back to his best.",
      "The Cheshire-born youngster scored 10 goals in 19 appearances for United's Under-18s in 2021/22, his first full season at the club, and his finishing ability is one of his finest qualities.",

      "Emi Martinez believes that Manchester United have sold a \"little treasure\" in Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Aston Villa goalkeeper was omitted from Unai Emery's matchday squad on Sunday as they suffered a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. The boss confirmed he wasn't \"focused\" on the fixture amid speculation over a potential transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Whilst Ruben Amorim insists that he's content with his goalkeeping options of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, momentum is building around the World Cup winner making an eleventh-hour switch to Manchester.",
      "However, Martinez won't be thrilled that the Portuguese boss has parted ways with one of his international colleagues, following Garnacho's £40million switch to Chelsea. When the young winger earned his first Argentina cap in June 2023, the goalkeeper was full of praise for Garnacho's qualities both on and off the pitch.",
      "Chatting to TyC Sports at the time, he said: \"He is a very humble guy. He came to work; he didn't talk a lot.",
      "\"He is very eager to play. The truth is that he's a little treasure and I hope we can mould him so that he gives us as much as Angel Di Maria.\"",
      "Whilst Martinez might be saddened by Garnacho's departure from the club he could potentially join in the coming hours, he still has a recognisable face ahead of him in United's defence.",
      "During Argentina's memorable World Cup triumph in 2022, the heroic goalkeeper branded Lisandro Martinez an \"animal\", as the duo helped their nation claim their third golden trophy - and their first since 1986. The defender has been absent from the United squad with a cruciate knee ligament injury since last season, but is aiming for a comeback to action following the international break.",
      "Meanwhile, the Villa goalkeeper could provide the solution to Amorim's goalkeeping dilemma, as both current shot-stoppers have struggled to win over supporters and pundits since the campaign began.",
      "Onana has featured just once for the Red Devils this term, in the disappointing penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup. Whilst the goalkeeper did stop one penalty, he was unable to prevent two goals from finding United's net during normal time, and has subsequently been benched in favour of Bayindir again.",
      "Bayindir has let in four goals across three matches, including a brace from newly-promoted Burnley on Saturday. Speaking about the potential departure of his first-choice goalkeeper, Emery remained as evasive as possible as he simply mentioned Martinez's replacement, Marco Bizot, repeatedly to journalists.",
      "When pressed further regarding the 32-year-old's unavailability, he added: \"He was not available. Tomorrow is the deadline, and we will see how we finish. We need the players focused and 100 per cent.",
      "\"He wasn't. We will see tomorrow. I cannot tell anything more. I don't know, this is the reality. We will see tomorrow.\" Royal Antwerp keeper Senne Lammes has also been linked with a late deadline day move to United.",

      "Manchester United are pushing to sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes for business on Monday at 7pm. Doubts over Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir have led to Ruben Amorim exploring other options.",
      "Throughout the window, Emiliano Martinez and Senne Lammens have been linked with moves to Old Trafford. A loan offer for Martinez was understood to be rejected previously before their attention turned to Lammens.",
      "Now, with less than 48 hours of the window remaining, United's search for a new number one has taken a number of twists and turns. On Sunday morning, it was suggested that Martinez would be prioritised, with personal terms not believed to be an issue, before other outlets suggested Lammens is the number one target.",
      "Both players are understood to be open to joining the club before the window slams shut. But with contrasting reports, who will United go for? Our writers share their verdict on who they think should be prioritised.",
      "I actually don't think this is as close as it may seem. United need a goalkeeper who is one of the best, someone who is going to immediately replace Onana and Bayindir. Martinez is that.",
      "Everything that has been said around Lammens points towards him being a competitor for the number one spot. Martinez comes in ready to take the shirt immediately.",
      "The Villa goalkeeper is one of the best at shot-stopping and being a presence inside his box. Too many times has Ruben Amorim been let down by his goalkeeper, and it's a feeling that Unai Emery hasn't had many times with Martinez.",
      "His age is a slight concern, but there's nothing stopping him from being the new Edwin van der Sar and drastically improving the numbers.",
      "I think that United need to sign a proven Premier League goalkeeper before Monday's 7pm deadline. It's clear that Bayindir and Onana are both not good enough for the Reds, meaning Amorim's side have got to dip into the market for a new No.1.",
      "While there is no doubt that Senne Lammens is a talent and has a lot of potential, I think that Emiliano Martinez would be the most ideal candidate at this stage. With 197 Premier League appearances under his belt, Martinez has cemented himself as an elite top-flight shot-stopper.",
      "As well as this, Martinez is a World Cup winner and has won the Yashin Trophy in the past two years, and I think he is the right calibre of goalkeeper that United need to target. Even though Martinez is 33 on Tuesday, I still believe United should still sign him, as they need a new 'keeper NOW.",
      "United should prioritise neither Emiliano Martinez nor Senne Lammens and go for Gianluigi Donnarumma. The latter is just years older than Lammens, with the former six months his senior.",
      "Donnarumma seems destined for Manchester City, but it has appeared that way for weeks, and Ederson remains at the club with James Trafford still between the sticks. United appears a better stylistic fit for the Italy international; such are the demands of being Pep Guardiola's goalkeeper.",
      "Wages presumably would be an issue, as they likely are for Martinez, but being able to move on from Onana would offset some of that outlay. Donnarumma could be United's goalkeeper for the next decade, much like David de Gea once was, who also received significant remuneration from the club.",
      "In the long term, signing Martinez for a few seasons before requiring a replacement. Gambling on Lammens and potentially needing an alternative in two years could also become more expensive without even considering the on-pitch impact.",

      "Raheem Sterling traded one London club for another in a last-minute switch in 2024, paving the way for Manchester United's Jadon Sancho to make his escape to Chelsea.",
      "The previous year's deadline day was rife with Premier League surprises, with the Blues' dramatic transfer activity making plenty of headlines. Two deals involving Chelsea, Arsenal and United saw Sancho and Sterling relocate to different parts of London on loan for the new season.",
      "As the transfer window closed, the Blues issued a brief statement confirming Sterling's departure that read: \"Good luck, Raheem.\"",
      "The then-29-year-old winger, who is now back at Stamford Bridge and has since turned 30, completed a last-minute loan move to the Emirates Stadium. This occurred after it became apparent that he was not in manager Enzo Maresca's plans at the club, with Pedro Neto and Joao Felix both joining the club over the summer.",
      "Chelsea welcomed another new face to their squad: former Dortmund winger Sancho, who essentially replaced Sterling. The England international had also been left out of then-manager Erik ten Hag's plans at United and was free to leave either on loan or permanently.",
      "Stamford Bridge was the young forward's preferred destination, with Chelsea agreeing to an obligatory purchase price of £23million if certain targets were achieved.",
      "This was a stark contrast to the hefty £73.5m that the club shelled out in the summer of 2021 to entice Sancho to Manchester.",
      "However, his performances at Old Trafford were underwhelming. He scored only 12 goals and provided six assists in 83 appearances, causing his value to plummet significantly.",
      "In the meantime, Sterling found himself back with an old acquaintance at Arsenal; manager Mikel Arteta, who had spent considerable time working under Pep Guardiola during Sterling's seven-year stint with Manchester City.",
      "Sterling's deal did not include an option or obligation to buy, meaning he would return to Chelsea at the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, regardless of his impact at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "During his spell at Arsenal, the forward scored just once and provided five assists in 28 appearances across all competitions, including the Champions League.",
      "Sterling was used sparingly but arguably had his best match when he assisted Oleksandr Zinchenko and Declan Rice in a 2-2 draw against PSV in their last 16 clash in Europe's premier competition, sending them through 9-3 on aggregate.",
      "He also made some contributions in the League Cup and Premier League, but he ultimately ended the season without any trophies and rarely played before returning to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Sancho had a standout year with Chelsea, netting five goals and providing 10 assists across 41 appearances in domestic and European competitions. The young winger's most notable performances came in the Premier League and the knockout stages of the Conference League.",
      "After reaching the Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund during his loan spell in the 2023/24 season - which they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid - Sancho found himself in another European final, this time with Chelsea.",
      "The Blues faced Real Betis - and fellow United loanee Antony - in the final, where they triumphed over the Spanish side in a resounding 4-1 victory, with Sancho scoring the third goal in the 83rd minute.",
      "Despite his contributions to their trophy-winning campaign, Chelsea chose to pay a fee to United to avoid triggering Sancho's buyout clause, seemingly unconvinced by the winger's performances.",
      "Sancho now finds himself part of Ruben Amorim's 'bomb squad', with the club still attempting to facilitate a move for the winger who doesn't feature in the Portuguese manager's future plans.",
      "Sancho has already rejected offers from Roma and Besiktas but is reportedly on the radar of several clubs, while Sterling also finds himself surplus to requirements at Chelsea. With both players in precarious positions at their respective clubs, there's every possibility they could be involved in another dramatic deadline day move but will no doubt hope to make a greater impact if they do end up joining new clubs.",

      "Chido Obi recently removed Manchester United from his bio on Instagram.",
      "The removal of the club's name could be completely insignificant, but followers of the academy have suggested it could be a hint at frustration with a lack of first-team opportunities.",
      "The best way to respond to that disappointment is to score for the academy and Obi notched his second goal of the campaign to open the scoring against Manchester City Under-21s.",
      "The Manchester clubs clashed at Leigh Sports Village on Sunday afternoon, which felt like the appetiser for the proper Manchester derby at the Etihad following the international break.",
      "Maybe Obi thought throughout the summer that he would have a chance of being involved in such occasions this season. The youngster made eight first-team appearances last term, he outshone Rasmus Hojlund during the post-season trip and travelled to the United States for pre-season.",
      "Obi started against Leeds in Stockholm and made a further two appearances from the bench in the USA, but Ruben Amorim has not named the young striker in any of his matchday squads this season.",
      "The 17-year-old must earn his stripes for first-team involvement. He made a strong impression last term in difficult circumstances, but it was obvious that he still had a long way to go with his development.",
      "Obi may look at Max Dowman (15) and Ethan Nwaneri (18) at his former club Arsenal and notice that Mikel Arteta has permanently promoted both of those players to his senior squad.",
      "Every situation is different, and Obi must knuckle down to impress Amorim with his performances for the U21s. He struggled to get involved for large parts of the first half against City in the mini-Manchester derby and received an earful from the newly appointed assistant manager, David Horseman.",
      "\"Go on Chido, inside shoulder,\" Horseman shouted at one stage to encourage Obi to press his opponent. Obi was drifting through the contest, but showed just before half-time why he is such a talent.",
      "Obi pounced on Divine Mukasa's indecision around the City penalty area. The youngster still had work to do, but impressively skipped into the box to finish brilliantly beyond City goalkeeper Jack Wint.",
      "Strikers who are worth their salt only need a single chance to finish and Obi has admirable instincts in the box. Some players must work tirelessly on their finish technique, but it comes naturally to Obi.",
      "United were fortunate to have a 1-0 advantage by the interval. City created excellent chances in the first 30 minutes, but couldn't find a breakthrough and their wastefulness was punished.",
      "\"Why did he shoot so early,\" City manager Ben Wilkinson vented on the touchline when Justin Oboavwoduo failed to keep his cool after a poor back pass from Jaydan Kamason.",
      "Wilkinson looked understandably disappointed as he returned to the dressing room for the break. City couldn't make their dominance count and the momentum shift continued when play resumed again.",
      "United were hugely improved at the beginning of the second half, seemingly energised following a discussion with Binnion. Sam Mather came close to scoring on the left and James Scanlon's shot flashed inches wide.",
      "Then Shea Lacey was introduced for Jayce Fitzgerald to make his first U21 appearance. The supremely talented youngster almost made an immediate impact with a volley from the edge of the box, but it was saved.",
      "City counter-attacked moments later to equalise through Reigan Heskey. Both sons of Emile Heskey started for City, while Darren Fletcher's twins started for United, which was a subplot to make fans feel old.",
      "Binnion reacted by introducing Amir Ibragimov. The youngster played a full 90 minutes for the Under-18s on Saturday and was not only fine to play again - but scored the match winner.",
      "Lacey played a wonderful cross into the box to find Ibragimov at the back post to wrap up an impressive Manchester derby victory. United fans will be hoping for the same result when the first-team play after the break.",

      "Emiliano Martinez has been left out of the Aston Villa squad to face Crystal Palace tonight, amid rumours regarding a potential transfer to Manchester United. The 32-year-old has been linked with a move to Old Trafford before Monday's 7pm deadline, as the Reds search for a new goalkeeper.",
      "It emerged on Saturday that United were considering a late swoop for Martinez after Altay Bayindir made another mistake during their 3-2 win against Burnley. The Argentina international, who has received multiple offers, is reported to be waiting on a move to the Reds.",
      "Martinez is said to have agreed personal terms on a switch to United and he is keen to push through a deal before the end of the transfer window. The Reds are thought to be in active talks with Villa for Martinez.",
      "With the former Arsenal 'keeper wanting to leave Villa Park and join the Reds, Unai Emery has now made the decision to leave Martinez out the squad to take on Palace in the 7pm Sunday kick-off.",
      "Despite starting last weekend's defeat at Brentford, Martinez won't feature against Palace with Marco Bizot selected as the Villa goalkeeper. Bizot signed from Ligue 1 club Brest on a free transfer in the summer and kept a clean sheet against Newcastle United earlier this month, when Martinez was suspended.",
      "While United are in negotiations with Villa for Martinez, the Reds are also making progress on a deal for Senne Lammens. The 23-year-old has been left out of successive Royal Antwerp squads and discussions with United continue. Lammens has not agreed personal terms, but it's hoped a breakthrough can be reached.",
      "Amorim has watched Bayindir make mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley in the Premier League. Andre Onana was recalled against Grimsby and made an error for their second goal.",
      "Speaking after the 3-2 win against Burnley, Amorim defended his 'keepers, insisting it's hard to be a goalkeeper in this current United side. \"Guys, they are humans,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It's deadline day and Manchester United are expecting a busy final day in the transfer window. Ruben Amorim's men got the majority of their business done earlier in the summer but there are still alarm bells ringing at Old Trafford.",
      "After three games, United have won one, drew one and lost one in the Premier League. Last week, they crashed out of the EFL Cup at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are showing glimpses of what they can do but Benjamin Sesko has struggled to make an impact. Now, with less than 24 hours of the window remaining, United are searching for a final addition.",
      "A new midfielder could still be added to Amorim's squad with Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller being linked with a move to the Premier League. According to journalist Sacha Tavolieri, Stuttgart chiefs are currently discussing whether or not to sell the player.",
      "Mason Mount's injury against Burnley and uncertainty over Kobbie Mainoo's future means a move for Stiller could be on the cards.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"After the first four games of the season, some would argue that a new midfielder is the priority for United over a goalkeeper. Casemiro has struggled and Bruno Fernandes is just better further forward.",
      "\"Stiller is a player who has been linked previously but leaving it until the last few days may be too late. It seems as though United are gunning for a new goalkeeper meaning signing the midfielder is unlikely.",
      "\"However, if they can get it over the line, they will be strengthening a key area with a transfer no-one saw coming.\"",
      "Jadon Sancho has been included in talks between United and Aston Villa for Martinez. According to The Athletic, the possibility of including the winger in a deal that would see him move to Villa Park has been mentioned.",
      "Martinez missed Villa's 3-0 loss to Crystal Palace on Sunday night amid interest from United. The report states that talks are ongoing between the two clubs, as are discussions with Antwerp for Lammens.",
      "Sancho is expected to depart United today with a number of clubs keen.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Much has been made of United's need to sign a goalkeeper and midfielder before the window closes. But perhaps one of their most important pieces of business today is shifting players who do not have a future at the club.",
      "\"Sancho falls into that bracket alongside Antony and Tyrell Malacia. The worrying thing is that none of them are on the brink of joining new clubs. If United can sign Martinez and sell Sancho in the same deal, they will be delighted.\"",

      "Newcastle should take a few minutes out during negotiations over selling Alexander Isak to ask Liverpool how best – and how worst – to reinvest the proceeds.",
      "Isak will finally get the move he has tried to force all summer after Newcastle and Liverpool found a breakthrough in talks over a fee.",
      "It is believed that Liverpool will pay a British record £125m to sign Isak, who will not receive a solidarity payment from Newcastle after spending the last few months finding whatever toys he can to throw out of his pram.",
      "Luke Edwards absolutely nailed it all along. Kitchen dances all round.",
      "It will be comfortably the biggest ever deal between two Premier League clubs and the largest sale in Newcastle history, wonderfully enough also set by Liverpool when they spent £35m on Andy Carroll.",
      "And it has granted Newcastle a far bigger budget to reinvest across a Champions League squad which faced a series of bruising rejections at the start of the summer before just about emerging for the better.",
      "Such money can be as much a blessing as it is a curse, as these eclectic examples show. The biggest Premier League sales ever, and what those fees were subsequently spent on, are below.",

      "An awkwardly-timed transfer ban prevented Chelsea from properly investing their Hazard money back into the squad immediately, although by the time Frank Lampard was given access to those funds a year later, the hit-rate was sub-optimal at best.",
      "That Hazard deal really was ridiculous; Chelsea were still receiving add-on payments when he was retired and well over a year after his last professional game.",

      "Naby Keita – £52.75m\nFabinho – £43m\nXherdan Shaqiri – £13.5m\nAlisson – £67m",
      "Liverpool put on an absolute transfer masterclass in 2018, extracting daft money from Barcelona for an excellent but expendable Coutinho and still managing to arguably underpay for four of their next five signings despite the selling clubs knowing they had a boosted budget.",
      "A world-record fee for Van Dijk was immediately offset and the Dutchman helped take them to the Champions League final within a matter of months; Fabinho, Alisson and even Shaqiri joined in the summer and played crucial roles in their European coronation and Premier League success.",

      "Once the dust settled following Liverpool and Chelsea’s embarrassing transfer stand-off of summer 2023, the winner was ultimately Brighton. It usually is.",
      "Caicedo had reached his peak value with the Seagulls and there were buyers whose funds were matched only by their desperation to sign a Premier League midfield panacea.",
      "Long before the money landed in their bank account, Brighton had popped Paul Barber’s laptop open to sign Caicedo’s replacement in Baleba, their future first-choice keeper in Verbruggen and a player they would sell for almost twice as much a couple of years later in Pedro.",

      "After scoring 280 goals in 435 appearances across nine full trophyless seasons, the last of which saw him net 30 times for a Spurs side which finished 8th and sacked two managers, Kane was finally granted his release by Daniel Levy.",
      "The emergence of a rich European suitor who could take Kane as far away as possible so as to not inflict any damage on his boyhood club was the deal-breaker as Spurs finally stepped aside to let their record scorer go.",
      "It was a necessary part of the great Ange Postecoglou rebuild, with more than twice the possible final Kane fee chucked back into a squad in dire need of reinforcements across the board.",
      "Spurs finished 5th to qualify for a Europa League they would win and, so far in summer 2025, squander to hilarious and predictable levels.",

      "Daniel Levy tried to counter the swollen valuations clubs face when trying to spend huge transfer windfalls, splashing all of the Bale money on The Magnificent Seven before the Welshman had even completed his move to Real Madrid.",

The money was there in the summer if I wanted to use it,” said Sir Alex Ferguson in December 2009, desperately trying to shield those frugal Glazers by later adding: “I have no criticism of the owners over money because none is justified. They’ve given me £20m for three players already.”",
      "Thank you so much for my brand new Gabriel Obertan, glorious overlords.",
      "The Manchester United manager had targeted Karim Benzema and Franck Ribery to help replace Ronaldo before settling for Owen and complaining that “the prices we were quoted for players were not reasonable” in a market that was “inflated” by Real Madrid and Manchester City’s thriftlessness.",

      "After squeezing what remains a record fee out of Manchester United, Leicester spread their jackpot across every area of their squad to mixed results. The Foxes built on consecutive finishes of 9th with Maguire in the side to produce back-to-back Champions League qualification challenges without him, ultimately coming 5th both times.",

      "Southampton put on a clinic on how not to redistribute a substantial transfer fee in the January 2018 window, making Guido Carrillo (no goals in 10 games) their record signing as they bid farewell to Van Dijk.",
      "The subsequent summer was slightly better but even then their best addition was a loanee from Liverpool, who presumably felt a little guilty.",

      "Everton are still feeling the financial effects of their resounding transfer incompetence in the 2017/18 season, when their reaction to selling a guaranteed 20-goal-a-season striker was to bring in loads of No.10s to create chances for a centre-forward they no longer had.",
      "Mind you, signing Cenk Tosun for £27.5m in January hardly helped.",

      "“Look at Tottenham. If you spend more than £100million, you expect to be challenging for the league,” is perhaps the single most disastrous sentence ever uttered by an eminently quotable Premier League manager.",
      "An attempt to shift the increasing focus and pressure on Liverpool not only backfired immediately – their title hopes imploded in that game against Chelsea two days later – but it created an unnecessary rod for the club’s back which sat uncomfortably all summer.",
      "As poorly as Tottenham executed their post-Bale spend, Liverpool’s effort to improve their squad with the Suarez money a year later was risible.",
      "",
      "Daniel James – £15m\nAaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m\nHarry Maguire – £80m",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided he needed a young, hungry, British core when given the permanent Manchester United reins, which is hardly surprising when he built much of his early managerial ethos around the Class of ’92 and Nou Camp-based corners because original thought is for nerds.",
      "The mere thought of a Sean Longstaff-Scott McTominay central midfield was enough to drive supporters to the point of impotent fury in 2019; by 2025 the former is the secret to survival for Leeds and the latter is Naples royalty.",
      "",
      "Alex Smithies – free\nWout Faes – £15m",
      "Victor Kristiansen – £13.1m\nTete – loan\nHarry Souttar – £15m",
      "A combination of Chelsea playing summer-long silly beggars over Fofana and Leicester tightening the purse strings to uncomfortable levels restricted the Foxes to a dismal and faintly depressing summer window which not even additional investment in the winter could salvage. The foundations for relegation were established."

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "",
      "2=) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nA curious one this but worth noting that he was an early favourite in the 24/25 betting before he got injured. Maybe everybody thinks he is due a trophy. He was poor against Manchester United in the opening game and then got injured again v Leeds United.",
      "",
      "1) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe now three-time winner of the PFA award is up there again in the betting, though we have a sneaky feeling this will be an After The Lord Mayor’s Show of a season from the Egyptian."

      "Heading into the international break void away at a team which had started with a win and a draw after spending over £160m this season, it was seemingly designed specifically to be Potter’s final stand.",
      "Yet Bowen scored as he tends to, Paqueta did the same before mugging off Fabrizio Romano, and Callum Wilson earned a presumably ungodly goal bonus while Crysencio Summerville emerged as a genuine game-changer, Mateus Fernandes showed that midfielders can have mobility and Kyle Walker-Peters actually defended his back post.",
      "Potter’s switch to a four-man defence helped change the mood completely. That was his biggest win in any game since October 2022, and equalled his best ever away in the Premier League. The critics are far from silenced but he will welcome them at least having to mutter under their breath for a while.",
      "",
      "While no different to any other manager in that there is a perception among the fanbase that his substitutions are often either wrong or timed poorly, the difference with Hurzeler is that he has a uniquely strong hand to shuffle as a coach outside the elite.",

      "There is definite outcome bias at play; if Brighton had been hit on the break, conceded again and slumped to a loss after that quadruple substitution then Hurzeler would be slammed for his naivety and foolishness. But he sensed a shift in the game with neither side having had a shot for 15 minutes and acted upon it.",
      "Brighton had the next four attempts including James Milner’s penalty equaliser, then weathered a mild two-shot storm in response from the visitors before having seven unanswered efforts on goal, culminating with Brajan Gruda’s winner.",
      "Two substitutes scoring after being introduced at 1-0 down, while Pep Guardiola chucked on Rico Lewis and Ruben Dias to try and salvage a point. As Hurzeler said, it was all about “energy” and “belief”. Rarely do you see either transfer between teams during a game so dramatically.",
      "",
      "A top-flight club-record unbeaten run, with the first Thursday-Sunday away grind of the season navigated without conceding a goal, having sold their best player while manoeuvring through continued speculation over their captain and being unable to name anything close to a full bench because of injuries and a lack of squad depth.",
      "Oliver Glasner is a magician and these are uncharted waters Crystal Palace are plainly sailing on.",
      "He must be backed over Marc Guehi. As Glasner said, it’s “tempting” to take the money for a player out of contract at the end of the season, but it feels as though Palace are on the brink of something special and there is a danger of jeopardising that by valuing the financial aspect of a deal too highly.",
      "If keeping Guehi gives them a better chance of renewing Glasner’s own terms before they expire next summer, it is entirely worth taking that hit. Glasner is “responsible for sports” and there is no-one better pound-for-pound in the Premier League, if not across the European coaching landscape as a whole.",

They have the lowest net spend of any team in Europe this summer by some way. Their 10 most recent first-team signings all had limited to no Premier League experience when they joined.",
      "Their most-used XI last season and the line-up which so thoroughly beat Spurs on their own patch shared three players: Adam Smith, Antoine Semenyo and Evanilson. And they appear to be better, more cohesive and more stable than last season.",
      "Iraola does feel eventually destined for something greater but only to the sort of level Bournemouth’s biggest player sales have been to this summer: your Real Madrids, your Paris Saint-Germains, your Liverpools, your Brentfords.",
      "Amine Adli personally hunting down the entire Spurs backline and midfield to retrieve a ball he didn’t even lose before getting his head down to sprint on a counter-attack, all in stoppage time away at a Champions League side, was emblematic of a team few can match physically or technically.",

      "One of those managers did have a Jack Grealish able to thrive again as the big fish in a smaller pond, as well as Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to help facilitate that. But that coach did also revitalise Beto while coaxing twice as many goals out of Iliman Ndiaye in 420 fewer minutes, so…",

      "It is a neat inverse of the recent promoted team archetype to beat sides established in the Premier League while losing to those you came up with.",

      "West Ham and Brentford are among that vulnerable subsect of teams which have been systematically weakened by the elite this summer. These games might not have explicitly carried the six-pointer label in the build-up but they will be imbued with no less importance if the tag is added retrospectively in discussing how they stayed up.",
      "Pulling those entrenched sides into trouble is the difficult part. In the last two seasons, the most wins a promoted team has recorded against non-promoted clubs was Luton with five in 2023/24, and none of the last six teams who came up ever recorded consecutive victories at home before their relegation was confirmed.",

      "",
      "A timely reminder, in spite of their apparent discovery of competence on the pitch, that they remain a delightful ball of insanity off it.",
      "One two-month injury to a rotated centre-forward should not prompt the cancelling of a loan to Bayern Munich and the recall of a striker from Sunderland while prompting speculation over another transfer.",
      "Spend the money on the appropriate substance required to wrap up Joao Pedro and maintain his safety. Brighton have probably found some in South America which works wonders.",

      "Fernandes is the perfect symbol of this particular half-decade of Manchester United ridiculousness either way. He should obviously have been sold for £100m to Saudi this summer, while also evidently being unsellable.",
      "He is not a leader but also shoulders the responsibility of his manager and coaching staff’s continued employment when needed in stoppage time.",

      "",
      "It is difficult to recall a more consequential recent Aston Villa defeat than their loss at Old Trafford on the final day of last season. At least the player largely responsible for the setback which helped cost them Champions League qualification isn’t trying to return to that scene while burning every bridge back to Birmingham he can find.",
      "Yet this cannot be pinned solely on Emi Martinez. His conduct and that situation has not helped but Villa look broken and lost on and off the pitch.",
      "Tyrone Mings calling for the squad “to act as professionally as possible” after the surrender to Crystal Palace felt desperate. The focus on simply surviving the rest of the transfer window, assessing the damage incurred by this team over the summer and moving on seems forlorn.",
      "Half-time substitute Emi Buendia should not be leading your team for tackles, nor should 17-year-old Bradley Burrowes have to be thrown on for his Premier League debut as a simultaneous message to the board and to Matty Cash for continuing to be Matty Cash.",
      "For all the talk of needing new faces to freshen things up, £26m summer signing Evann Guessand only lasted the first half and was still tackled more times than anyone all game.",
      "Morgan Rogers and Ollie Watkins have attracted interest and an internal valuation of around £140m yet Villa are the only team in the entire English football pyramid yet to score a league goal this season.",
      "And adding most of a painfully ordinary Jadon Sancho’s earnings to a disastrous wage-to-revenue ratio does not feel like a happy solution.",
      "The transfer deadline leading into an international break brings a chance to reset and recalibrate. No club needs it more.",
      "",
      "Not sure there is ever a particularly good time to lose 3-0 at home to a side previously without a win but the inopportune timing of that Nottingham Forest setback on the eve of a crunch meeting with the volatile owner was not lost on Nuno.",
      "His previous Premier League sacking was brought about by a home defeat by the same scoreline to a hapless United, and meted out by an exacting and unforgiving chairman. Perhaps Nuno should start considering his choices and the consequences of his actions more thoroughly.",
      "",
      "It was not even the first time in the last 300 days that Manchester City have lost to Brighton having led, but there is a pattern of carelessness and frailty emerging when Pep Guardiola’s side are in the supposed ascendancy.",
      "They collapsed late on against Manchester United in December, to Sporting and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League either side of that, against Real Madrid in February and even against Al-Hilal in the Club World Cup.",
      "Guardiola teams rarely lose at all, but the frequency with which they are being beaten in games they have led is freakish.",
      "",
      "It is almost impressive how insistent Wolves are on tying their own shoelaces together at the start of the marathon sprint that is a Premier League season.",
      "While others at least make a vague effort to prepare for the race ahead, Wolves turn up at the blocks half-dressed and facing backwards.",
      "They essentially write off August every year. Their results in the opening month of every top-flight campaign since promotion in 2018 make for hilariously painful reading: 26 games, two wins, nine draws and 15 defeats.",
      "One of those victories was in lockdown September against an atrocious Sheffield United; the other came two years ago against Everton, who instead sent them into this international break at as low an ebb as is imaginable for a Premier League side.",
      "Wolves handicap themselves so thoroughly each season that it should come as no surprise. A transfer policy predicated on selling their best players and taking time to replace them with inferior ones means the pressure builds, momentum doesn’t and the revolving door of coaches never really stops spinning.",
      "It just feels like there is probably a middle ground between embracing their position in the food chain and meticulously identifying rough diamonds to polish and upsell, and sacrificing the first three or so matches of every season to facilitate that role. Once clubs get lost in that cycle it tends to end only one way.",
      "",
      "Every aspect of the modern Southampton survival blueprint is to be avoided at all costs and although predominantly playing in the same colour kit cannot be helped, Brentford really could have done without copying their bizarre outlook on penalties.",
      "Cameron Archer had never taken a spot-kick in his 117-game professional career before stepping up at 0-0 against Manchester United last September; that he hasn’t taken one since indicates how well it went.",
      "Ben Brereton Diaz had scored all nine he had taken at senior level by that point, was on the pitch and even assumed ownership of the ball in that transparent new way players do to relieve pressure on the actual taker before handing it over to Archer.",
      "“Cam has practiced a lot over the last two weeks during the international break whilst he’s been here and Ben hasn’t,” was Russell Martin’s irrefutable justification for allowing a fortnight of evidence to override two respective careers’ worth of proof.",
      "Southampton never recovered from Andre Onana’s save and were beaten 3-0.",
      "Kevin Schade had never taken a spot kick in his 114-game professional career before stepping up at 0-0 against Sunderland and an imitation of Ivan Toney so pale it would make Casper The Friendly Ghost look tanned suggested he should never have the opportunity again.",
      "Igor Thiago has scored ten of the 12 he has taken at senior level, including one literally 13 days prior – when Schade was also on the pitch against Nottingham Forest – but was passed over here for a reason hitherto unexplained adequately.",
      "Brentford did later take the lead but ultimately lost control and the game.",
      "“We’ve worked hard during pre-season on identifying penalty takers,” said Keith Andrews before the entirely contradictory addition of “Thiago and Kevin are the designated penalty takers”.",
      "A situation which needs clarity, hierarchy and leadership was unnecessarily muddled and it stung them.",
      "",
      "The introspection should probably start and end with one Thomas Frank quote:",
      "“Sometimes you need a player who can do something out of nothing. Go past the player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day. That’s what I think he can bring.”",
      "Spurs have tried and increasingly hilariously failed to fill that creative void left by James Maddison’s injury; Bournemouth exposed and exploited it. For the first time Frank’s adaptive tactics and philosophy did not come close to providing an answer to what they faced.",
      "No pressure, Xavi Simons.",
      "",
      "Losers because they lost. As Arne Slot said, “if we play this game ten times more in the same fashion then I think it’s eight times a draw, we win it one time and Arsenal win it one time”.",
      "And that is fine without pretending it proved Arsenal are bottle merchants who have no hope of winning the title if they can’t rock up to Anfield and saunter out with a victory.",
      "Although Arsenal probably do need to win it that one time Slot mentioned when Liverpool visit the Emirates in January.",
      "",
      "It did seem as though Eddie Howe got his words the wrong way round when declaring it was “absolutely massive for us to sign a striker” as 6ft 6ins Nick Woltemade ducked through the door.",
      "But the point stands: while Will Osula makes up for a lack of decisive quality 100 times over with his work rate and self-sacrifice, that is never going to be enough to lead a team already defined by its energy, effort and intensity.",
      "Newcastle need something different, a goal threat which weaves seamlessly with that tone-setting desire and application. And as Howe said, “one more player” even after a club-record transfer is probably necessary with the Alexander Isak saga almost over.",
      "Of course a starting line-up in which Bruno Guimaraes had the most career Premier League goals (22) was held to a 0-0 draw. Jacob Murphy (19) and Fabian Schar (18) completed that depressing podium and leaving out £90m of starting wingers before bringing them on with nothing to aim for did not help.",
      "Newcastle lost as many games as they won when having 60 per cent of the ball or more in the Premier League last season. A pair of goalless draws with a possession share only just under that does not suggest the issue has been sorted over a summer of transfer distraction and disturbance.",

      "Nobody really cares or remembers if you are wrong about transfers. Unless, and this caveat is crucial, you are an absolute dick about it.",

      "Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has been sacked by Bayer Leverkusen after just three games in charge of the Bundesliga club.",
      "The Dutchman only took over from Xabi Alonso this summer but has reportedly already fallen out with the Leverkusen hierarchy and a draw and a defeat from their first two league games has seen him sacked from the role.",
      "Simon Rolfes, managing director of sport, said: “This decision was not an easy one for us. Nobody wanted to take this step. However, the past few weeks have shown that building a new and successful team with this setup is not feasible. We firmly believe in the quality of our team and will now do everything we can to take the next steps in our development with a new setup.”",
      "CEO Fernando Carro said: “A parting of ways at this early stage of the season is painful, but we felt it was necessary. We remain committed to achieving our goals for the season – and to do that, we need the best possible conditions at all levels and across the entire first team. Now it’s a matter of fully implementing and utilising these conditions again.”",
      "The sudden departure comes after a 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen, a result that saw club captain Robert Andrich tear into his team-mates.",

      "“Everyone played for themselves, everyone ran around the pitch on their own,” Andrich said. “We have too many players who are preoccupied with other things or only with themselves. I don’t know if I’ve ever experienced that at Bayer.",
      "“The disastrous final phase was a symbol of our current situation. This has nothing to do with any unrest, player transfers, or legal proceedings.",
      "“They see: They’re leading 2-1, could make it 3-1, and are discussing a penalty first. These are the little things that build up an opponent. We can’t stand around for two minutes and play rock-paper-scissors to see who’s going to take the penalty. That’s one of many things that aren’t going well for us at the moment.”",
      "Ten Hag’s task was also not made any easier by the number of outgoings from the club this summer. The team that Alonso guided to an invincible league campaign in 2023-24 has been picked apart, with Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Amine Adli, Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka all leaving. Meanwhile Alonso went to Real Madrid.",
      "Ten Hag admitted at the weekend that having players leave “hurts.”",
      "“Letting good players leave always hurts,” he said. “But we also have other good players and they then need to take on that task.”",
      "Ten Hag has now been sacked from his two previous jobs, having lost the United gig in October 2024.",

      "Losing at home to West Ham has left Nuno Espirito Santo in some quite considerable trouble. Even more than Ruben Amorim.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "That’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse against the Blues, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season.",
      "But that victory over Forest, coming as it did with Lucas Paqueta’s don’t-come-and-get-me plea was impeccably timed. It would’ve been an unmanageable international break void had they lost that, even if Potter is far from out of the woods just yet.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Even more entertainingly, it might even be Jose Mourinho…",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Amorim could resign or be sacked but as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s once again a ‘feeling at Man Utd that Amorim may resign’ and we can add being rubbish to a list of reasons including a dodgy knee and the lack ...",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim insists he wants Kobbie Mainoo “to stay” at Old Trafford and “fight for his place” this season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has repeated an unforgivable Erik Ten Hag move at Manchester United, while a surprise favourite emerges to replace him.",
      "Some players in the Man Utd dressing room are questioning the tactics deployed by Ruben Amorim so far this season, according to reports."

      "What’s this? A Transfer Deadline Day that cannot be overhyped? Oh, you sexy b*stard. Follow all the gossip and done deals live with F365…",
      "Welcome to Transfer Deadline Day XXIV. We’ve had some classics down the years and, admittedly, we’ve had some absolute turnips. This one, though, could be the Deadline Day GOAT.",
      "Why? Because despite having had three months to work through their transfers to-do lists, almost every Premier League club goes into the final day of summer 2025 window with business at hand.",
      "In some cases, we’re talking bloody big business. It’s entirely possible that we will see the British transfer record being broken today.",
      "We’ll cover the final instalment of the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga here as well as the 427 other deals that could be done today. You don’t even need to keep F5-ing for the latest updates, so if you really need to look busy for your boss, then get involved and send us your thoughts.",
      "If you’re a receiver rather than a giver, that’s cool. Just stay here for all the latest news and gossip. If done deals are more your thing, here you go.",
      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Liverpool were showing off with a scrappy title race win. Potter, Hurzeler, Glasner and Iraola impressed but Aston Villa and Wolves are in free fall.",
      "Add Alexander Isak to this unbeaten Liverpool side and they absolutely have to win the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal need not be the ‘nearly’ side; without Mikel Arteta’s caution they could achieve more. So says John Nicholson, who is Not A Fan.",
      "Nobody really cares or remembers if you are wrong about transfers. Unless, and this caveat is crucial, you are an absolute dick about it.",
      "We have Arsenal and Liverpool reactions to that borefest at Anfield which some feeling better about Mikel Arteta. Not everybody though."

Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

      "For a United side searching for the right balance and cutting edge, Mbeumo's attributes are exactly what they need in that he is direct, strong and capable of changing defence into attack with quick movements.",
      "His ability to drift between the full-back and centre-back channel created havoc for Burnley with Bruno Fernandes pinging him great service that was exploited on regular occasions, especially in the first half.",
      "United have been in search of a player who can bring more dynamic attacking options to the table and in Mbeumo they may just have found him.Lewis Jones",
      "This 1-0 home defeat to Bournemouth was a reality check for Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank.",
      "After the highs of winning at Manchester City, Spurs put in a dreadful display against Bournemouth that has punctured the air of optimism under the Dane, with the full-time whistle met by boos.",
      "One fan departing the stadium at full-time shouted: 'same old Spurs', and it was considering they came into this with a chance of moving top and maintaining a perfect start.",
      "Those wins against Burnley and Man City proved a false dawn as Spurs looked clueless against an outstanding Bournemouth.",
      "On the day Spurs found out their fixture dates for the Champions League, you would have thought Bournemouth were the team to be facing Villarreal at home on September 16, such was the dominance and slickness in their display.",
      "A toothless Spurs had just five shots against the Cherries, while Frank's side failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League home game since February 2020.",
      "How Frank could have done with his new £51m signing Xavi Simons on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank said of Simons at his post-match press conference: \"Sometimes you need a player that can do something a little bit out of nothing, go past a player, produce a cross, a shot, a pass, with that extra quality that you need on the day, and that's what I think he can bring.\"",
      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Barrott was then told to review the decision by VAR Stuart Atwell. After a three-minute review, Barrott awarded a penalty for a \"sustained pulling action\" from Anthony on Amad. The shirt pull started outside the penalty area.",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker was unable to hide his frustration at full-time: \"It's the way the game is going. It's going to become the most sterile game there is. We're probably months or a year away from not celebrating goals.",

      "Similar to the later penalty that was awarded, the contact began outside of the area before the pair ended up on the floor in the area.",
      "In this case, Barrott awarded the penalty; however, following a five-minute review and being advised to check the screen, the on-field decision was overturned with a drop-ball awarded to the Clarets.",
      "\"When Kyle Walker makes initial contact, he's about a foot outside of the area, so I think it might be overturned and given a free-kick outside [the penalty area]. The actual contact is on the back of his calf and it's outside the area.",
      "\"If it's outside, it's factual [so it should be overturned]. It's in or out. So for me it's a free-kick for United from outside the area, in my opinion.\n\"The initial contact was outside and then he's fallen inside.

      "At 2-1 down, Burnley thought they were level as Foster capped a fine move only for his effort to be ruled out for offside.",

      "Leny Yoro did not feature in Manchester United's disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup; United still searching for their first win of the season after defeat to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham in the Premier League; they host Burnley on Saturday",
      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",
