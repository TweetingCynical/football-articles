      "Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount will both be available for Manchester United vs Burnley as they aim to kick-start the post-Ruben Amorim era. The Red Devils take on the Clarets at Turf Moor on Wednesday evening in their first game since the Portuguese coach was sacked.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been placed in caretaker charge for the game. And he could have a couple of key players available once again after Fernandes and Mount both missed the draw with Leeds United. United captain Fernandes has missed the last three games, while Mount has sat out of the last two.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Fletcher said: “Mason [Mount] and Bruno [Fernandes] were pushing to play against Leeds and the decision was that they weren't quite ready. So they have trained and they should be back in the squad.",
      "“They are on managed minutes and restricted minutes because they have only just returned to training so that is good news, especially because they are players who have been in good form. Mason Mount's form has been fantastic and Bruno Fernandes... you don't have to speak about him.",
      "“He's the captain, the leader of the team. To have them available for selection is obviously great news for me, the players and the club and the fans.”",
      "And while United might have Mount and Fernandes to call upon once more, they are still missing a few stars. Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui remain at the African Cup of Nations, while Kobbie Mainoo, Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt have recently been struggling with their own issues.",
      "Should the trio remain out, that could see Fletcher add to the squad with youth players - sons Jack and Tyler among those who could be included. The former midfielder stopped short of confirming whether they would be in the squad.",
      "He added: “That would be disclosing team information before the game and I am not going to do that before the game. They were in the training group on Monday because that was already arranged before I got there.",
      "“They have been in the squad recently but obviously we have got a couple of players back from injury so we will assess that tomorrow and we will have to assess a couple of players tomorrow due to the short turnaround from games. They are in the periphery squad but whether they make the match squad I don't know yet, that remains to be seen.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jose Mourinho has revealed only Ruben Amorim will know the true reason behind his Manchester United exit. The Portuguese coach was sacked earlier this week after a rotten year-and-a-bit in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "The Red Devils have already launched the search for his eventual successor but former boss Mourinho has had his say. Now with Benfica, the 62-year-old has told his compatriot to consider why he was sacked.",
      "“What happened with Rúben is something that only Rúben can analyse,” Mourinho said to Portuguese outlet O Jogo. “I believe he will do it, he and his staff. Whether he will do it with you and make his view public, that I do not know.”",
      "Asked if Amorim’s exit could add pressure for other promising young Portuguese coaches, Mourinho added: “I do not understand why it would, but each coach will answer for himself. For me, no, I do not feel it that way.”",
      "Of course, Mourinho is no stranger to the sack. The Portuguese was also fired by the Red Devils following a two-and-a-half year stint at Old Trafford.",
      "While he has refused to compare his experience to Amorim’s, Mourinho has suggested that new opportunities could soon present themselves to the former Sporting Lisbon boss.",
      "“My career at Manchester United, I know it well. I also know the reason why I ended up leaving,” Mourinho said. “But as I always do, or try to do, when I leave a club I close the door and then I do not make comments. I do not analyse externally what happened.",
      "“A door closes and another one will open. That is what happened when I left. The history stayed there, the numbers stayed there, the three medals came home and that is it.”",
      "Who should Man United appoint as their next manager? Share your thoughts in the comments",
      "Mourinho oversaw 144 games as United boss between May 2016 and December 2018. He won the Community Shield, FA Cup and League Cup during that spell.",
      "But he was replaced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following a dire third season with United. The Norwegian could ironically be called upon once more this time around, with reports suggesting that the former manager could be appointed on an interim basis for a second time.",

      "Manchester United are searching for a new head coach following the departure of Ruben Amorim on Monday morning. The club confirmed in a statement: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher has been appointed to oversee Wednesday's fixture against Burnley, though it's unclear whether he'll remain in charge for the remainder of the campaign before a permanent appointment is made in the summer. Meanwhile, Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have been mentioned as possible interim options for the rest of 2025/26, with reports on Tuesday afternoon suggesting contact had been made between the latter's camp and the club.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is currently favourite to take up tenure at United. The Norwegian enjoyed a three-year stint with the club between 2018 and 2021 and has already demonstrated that he can hold his own in the Premier League. An interim or caretaker role until season's end is the most likely scenario, but it remains to be seen as to whether that would interest Solskjaer.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has also been linked with being next in line for the United hot seat. The Austrian said of the role in September: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\" Out of contract at Selhurst Park this summer, a move to United any sooner looks unlikely considering Glasner's commitment to the club.",
      "Out of the managerial game since stepping down from the England national team last summer, Gareth Southgate has been linked with a role with the Reds for some time now. It is unknown whether he would be willing to step up in an interim job, or whether a permanent role would solely appeal to him at present.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins of the first-team for United's clash with Burnley on Wednesday. However, the club could afford him the rest of the season on an interim basis depending on how he fares this week, as they continue to search for a full-time appointment.",
      "An appointment for Thomas Tuchel is highly unlikely at present, considering the German is currently preparing to guide England to glory at the 2026 World Cup. However, his name has been put out there by the bookies.",
      "Enzo Maresca could be set for a return to Premier League management just a week after leaving Chelsea. The Italian head coach has a solid resume with the Blues, including a Europa Conference League title and last summer's Club World Cup win.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino has also found himself highlighted as a suitable candidate to guide United to glory. The Argentine has experience in the Premier League with both Chelsea and Tottenham, although is currently tied up with the USA national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "Michael Carrick has been out of a job since he was sacked by Middlesbrough last summer, and given his past affiliation with the Reds, could work as a caretaker until season's end. He has previously worked in a caretaker role, and will know what is expected by the board.",
      "Barcelona legend, Xavi, is another name which has been mentioned with regard to taking up a head coach role at Old Trafford. The La Liga legend has enjoyed managerial stints at Al Sadd and at the Camp Nou, but has never managed - nor played for - an English team.",
      "Currently in charge of Ipswich, who are third in the Championship standings, Kieran McKenna is also a bit of a long shot for the job. However, given he has previously worked at the club as an assistant to Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, he could be a good fit should he have his head turned."

      "Manchester United face the significant task of finding a new manager to succeed Ruben Amorim but that hasn't stopped speculation about new signings. This is despite Amorim hinting at a lack of January investment just days before getting the sack.",
      "Darren Fletcher will be in the dugout for Wednesday's Premier League trip to Burnley but the Scot's eventual successor may have targets of their own. Whether those changes come in January or over the summer is a different matter, though, with decisions to be made.",
      "Last year, United were relatively quiet in the winter window. Ayden Heaven joined from Arsenal's academy and was followed to Old Trafford by Patrick Dorgu in a big-money move from Lecce.",
      "There are a number of targets on the club's radar, especially in the midfield area, with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson potential summer targets. The indication so far is there's unlikely to be the money for marquee signings like that in January but that doesn't mean United will be silent.",
      "While United find themselves waiting until the summer to spend big, there could be scope for more creative deals in the meantime. One of these involves RB Leipzig starlet El Chadaille Bitshiabu, with L'Equipe reporting that the Premier League club could come in with an offer of a loan with an option to buy",
      "They are unlikely to be the only club in the mix, though. Bayer Leverkusen are said to be exploring a similar deal, while Monaco are also keen amid a defensive injury crisis and Lyon also in the mix.",
      "There's one bigger problem, though. Earlier reports from Bild indicated Leipzig are not prepared to sanction an exit for the young defender in January. This, the German outlet claims, applies to both loans and permanent deals.",
      "Bitshiabu returned from a hamstring injury in December but has been used sparingly by his club this season. Just three of his five appearances have come in the league, with Castello Lukeba and Willi Orban ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Yan Diomande's fast start at RB Leipzig has prompted plenty of interest from across Europe but a January switch looks to be off the cards. Diomande joined the German club from Leganes over the summer but has already caught the eye, not least with the hat-trick he scored against Eintracht Frankfurt in early December.",
      "Manchester United are one of two Premier League clubs in the mix, according to The Athletic. Tottenham Hotspur are also said to be keen on the Ivorian teenager, who Leipzig expect to command a fee of up to £86million, as are a number of unnamed clubs from elsewhere in Europe.",
      "Premier League clubs have had what can only be described as mixed success when signing players from Leipzig in recent windows. Josko Gvardiol and Dominik Szoboszlai have done the business for Manchester City and Liverpool respectively but attacking players haven't been quite as efficient.",
      "The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko after he joined United from the Bundesliga side in the last window, while Timo Werner and Christopher Nkunku failed to repeat their Leipzig scoring feats after moving to Chelsea. Both forwards were sold at a loss by the Blues, with Werner returning to Leipzig and Nkunku joining AC Milan.",

      "Liverpool are yet to dip into the January transfer window but rumours are gathering pace that they could be about to strike. Arne Slot's side were met with an agonising late blow against Fulham on Sunday as they drew 2-2 in the Premier League.",
      "Cody Gakpo looked to have stolen all three points at Craven Cottage only for a late wonder strike from Harrison Reed to rescue a point for Marco Silva's men. The stalemate has some fans agitated that the club need to be active this January.",
      "It's the second consecutive draw for Liverpool after they were also held to a stalemate with Leeds United at Anfield on New Year's Day. The Reds' performance against Daniel Farke's side was slated for lacking creativity.",
      "Rumours are heating up that Liverpool are interested in Brighton's Carlos Baleba. The Cameroon international was reportedly courted by Man United in the summer but a move never materialised.",
      "The Seagulls are rumoured to want in excess of £100million for the ex-Lille youngster, making any move a tricky procedure to pull off. CaughtOffside have reported, however, that the Reds are the latest side to register an interest in acquiring the midfielder's services.",
      "It's said that Brighton are ‘fielding multiple enquiries’ for their star man. However, while a sale in January is unlikely it's expected that Baleba will move on at the end of the season.",
      "Liverpool are also reportedly interested in bolstering their engine room with Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton also linked with the club.",
      "United have also shown a keen interest in Wharton. According to Spanish outlet AS, Slot's side also face a battle with Chelsea, Manchester City and Real Madrid for the player, with the publication claiming that any club will have to fork out a considerable amount for the defensive midfielder.",
      "Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott has been linked with a surprise move to Charlotte FC in the States but a new development appears to make a move unlikely.",
      "According to The Athletic, sources close to the player have played down interest in the Englishman securing a move to America. Elliott's season-long loan to Aston Villa hasn't worked out and now attentions have turned to the next step in his career with the World Cup looming.",
      "Elliott has joined Villa on a loan with an obligation to buy - £35m - should he reach 10 appearances for the club. However, Elliott has been stuck on five appearances since October and only two of those were starts.",
      "It's clear Villa won't be meeting the 10 appearances and he cannot be loaned out to another club this season unless their fixtures do not align with the European calendar - hence the Charlotte FC interest.",
      "With Mohamed Salah at AFCON and experiencing poor form, Liverpool could do with a player of Elliott's calibre, so a return to his club could work out well for all parties. However, there is no re-call option in the contract, so the deal would have to be cancelled entirely for him to return to Liverpool.",

The striker made his debut for Blackburn in 2024 as a 16-year-old and is currently on scholarship terms after reportedly turning down the chance to sign a professional contract.",

This month is the final chance for Blackburn to command a transfer fee for Tyjon.",
      "Arsenal are reportedly the frontrunners in the race to sign Karim Adeyemi from Borussia Dortmund. The 23-year-old German international has been linked with several Premier League clubs, including Manchester United, having established himself as one of the Bundesliga’s best wingers.",
      "Adeyemi, who is said to be worth around £61m, was last month reported to want to leave the German giants.

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has emerged as the favourite to take charge of Manchester United from Darren Fletcher until the end of this season after Ruben Amorim's sacking. A return to Old Trafford could come mere months after Marcus Rashford spoke highly of his first stint at the club.",
      "The Norwegian, who has been without a club since his Besiktas sacking last year, is said to be one of the frontrunners alongside Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy to take over on a caretaker basis, with the club deciding to wait until the summer to appoint a new permanent boss.",
      "Solskjaer is now the favourite with some bookmakers to be given the nod and knows the club inside out, having spent 11 years of his playing career at Old Trafford before managing the team for three years between 2018 and 2021. He still has a strong bond with a number of United players and recently spoke glowingly about Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire.",
      "Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona from United, was also left with a high impression of Solskjaer, having enjoyed some of his best football under the club icon. The forward told the Danish television station TV2 in October last year: \"Ole is a fantastic person. I loved playing under him. I can speak for many of the players at Manchester United when I say that we enjoyed playing for him. We played good football under Ole.",
      "\"It was a very successful period for me personally. He is a fantastic person, and I don't have a bad word to say about him.\"",
      "Rashford also said he talks to Solskjaer \"from time to time\". However, he conceded that \"it's been a while now\" since they last spoke.",
      "The forward played more and scored more under him than any other United coach. Rashford had 55 goals and 36 assists across 135 matches.",
      "Out of Erik ten Hag, Mourinho and Solskjaer, the academy graduate also managed his best minutes per goal while working with the latter. He averaged a goal every 182 minutes, compared to one every 199 for Ten Hag and every 251 under Mourinho.",
      "Solskjaer took caretaker charge of United after they sacked Mourinho in December 2018, before being appointed as their permanent manager three months later. His tenure lasted just under three years in total, with Michael Carrick and then Ralf Rangnick taking interim charge before Ten Hag eventually took over.",
      "Solskjaer spoke about Rashford during an appearance on The Rest is Football in November. He said: \"I've not spoken to Marcus since I left. I text him a little bit, but circumstances.",
      "\"I don't know what's happened in his life, but you can see he's certainly enjoying it now in Barcelona. It looked like he didn't enjoy himself here. I don't think that's just Man United [not enjoying it], it's everywhere.",
      "\"All the pressures, every single one is different, we don't know what's happened to the players when they walk in in the morning, grumpy, that's the manager's job: 'What's up? I can see something's wrong.'",
      "\"We don't know what's happened, we just want him to do well. He's an incredible player when he's in form and happy; he's got that energy. I go back to Erling Haaland, just the energy that he shows all the time, when he's on the pitch, he shows that enthusiasm and energy, that's the least.",
      "\"But what is it? Life? Too many games? We don't know, but he's found the right balance.\"",

      "\"It was more the withdrawn nature of my dad. He would be the centre of attention, but he had to be asked a question to speak.\"",
      "Michael Rawlinson KC, representing the McQueen family, asked how her father scored his goals.",
      "She replied: \"Mainly with his head, from a set-piece.\" They learned more about his illness after her mum Yvonne spoke with Dawn Astle, daughter of ex-England striker Jeff Astle, who had the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and died in 2002 aged 59.",
      "Prof Willie Stewart, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, said that CTE was present.",
      "\"Gordon technically fell into the lower stage of the disease, although on the threshold of the higher stage,\" he added. Prof Stewart said symptoms of CTE were cognitive decline and neuro-behaviour change, and that they \"can't be explained by another condition.\"",
      "He said symptoms were \"typical in individuals who have long careers, professional footballers and rugby players\". Asked if there was a causal link between CTE and repetitive head injury, he replied: \"The answer to that is yes.\"",

      "Ralf Rangnick looks set to have a major say in Manchester United’s search for a new manager, having green lit a move for Oliver Glasner AND his potential new boss. The Red Devils are on the hunt for Ruben Amorim’s successor following his sacking earlier this week.",
      "Former midfielder Darren Fletcher is taking temporary charge for the trip to Burnley on Wednesday, albeit United will be keen to agree a deal with a more permanent option sooner rather than later. The man tasked with sounding out Amorim’s replacement is set to be Christopher Vivell.",
      "According to Marca, the 39-year-old will be handed a far more prominent role in the club’s hunt for a new boss, as well as player recruitment going forwards. Vivell moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2024 as an interim director of recruitment, while he was then given the job on a full-term basis in February last year.",
      "Vivell has had spells with Hoffenheim, Red Bull Salzburg and RB Leipzig - crossing paths with Rangnick during his stint with the Austrian and German sides. According to previous reports, Rangnick had head-hunted Vivell for a role at United, only to leave the club shortly after.",
      "Away from Vivell, it also appears that Rangnick would back a move for Crystal Palace boss Glasner. He has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford, with his future at Selhurst Park up in the air.",
      "Glasner’s contract expires at the end of the current campaign. Speaking about his compatriot back in 2023, Rangnick said: \"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach.”",
      "Glasner in the meantime has also spoken out about his future and refused to commit to his current employers. He said: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Asked about his Palace contract situation last month, Glasner added: \"There's no time. Believe me, I'm never thinking about my future right at the moment. It's not important right now.",
      "\"I know there are so many rumours. But I don't know how many clubs I managed in the last three months and I'm still sitting here.",
      "\"As soon as we will take a decision, number one, the players will hear it, and, number two, [the media] will hear it.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a fan of Jurgen Klopp but that's unlikely to be enough to convince the German to make a shock move to Old Trafford. United's sacking of Ruben Amorim has seen attention turn to out of work managers, with former Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca's name coming up, but ex-Liverpool manager Klopp would appear to be a non-starter for a number of reasons.",
      "\"Klopp has this ability to drive his players to a frenzy,\" Ratcliffe said back in March 2024, after his arrival at Manchester United had been confirmed. \"Total commitment on the pitch. And, you know, that's one of the things a good coach can do.\"",
      "At the time, Ratcliffe was asked whether he might be tempted to give Klopp a call in the knowledge the German had decided to leave Anfield at the end of the 2023/24 season. However, he quickly fired back at the reporter who asked the question, telling him: \"You can’t ask questions like that\".",
      "Ratcliffe hasn't been afraid to bring in staff with connections to rival clubs, most notably bringing in former City Football Group figure Omar Berrada as CEO. However, a move for Klopp would be another matter altogether, and the former Borussia Dortmund boss has already indicated he wouldn't entertain such a switch.",
      "\"If you ask me, 'Will you ever work as a manager again?' I would say now no. But I don't know obviously how that will feel because I never had the situation,\" Klopp said when confirming his Liverpool exit. \"What I know definitely – I will never, ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool, 100 per cent.",
      "\"That's not possible. My love for this club, my respect for the people is too big. I couldn't. I couldn't for a second think about it. There's no chance. This is part of my life, we are part of the family, we feel home here. There's no chance to do that.",
      "\"But all the rest, will I ever work again? Of course, I know myself, I cannot just sit around. I will find something else maybe to do. But I will not manage a club or a country at least for a year, that's not possible, I cannot do that and I don't want to. That's all.\"",
      "Klopp has stuck to his word, taking a role as Red Bull's global head of soccer but showing no indication of returning to the dugout. Even if he were to make a return, a United move looks to be off the table, with the German previously rubbishing suggestions he had a dream of one day taking charge of the Old Trafford side.",
      "“I really like Eckhard Krautzun but when I think too far in the past I am not 100 per cent sure what is right or wrong but it is still funny. I am sure he thinks it was like this,\" Klopp said in 2017 after his former Mainz boss Krautzun spoke of that supposed United ambition.",
      "“How could I, as a very average player at Mainz, say to my manager, ‘By the way, if I become a manager I would love to manage Manchester United’. Maybe people think I am a little bit crazy but I am not that crazy. I never thought about something like this.",
      "\"[Krautzun] was a big admirer, and is still, of Sir Alex Ferguson. In our first meeting he was wearing a jumper of Manchester United when he came in as a new coach. Maybe he forgot. There are a few funny stories, unfortunately a few things are not exact but still funny. I had fun when I read it but not all of it is exactly like this.”",
      "While Klopp moving to United now looks to be an impossibility given his Liverpool connections, he was approached by the Red Devils back in 2013. At the time, the club was looking for a successor to Sir Alex Ferguson and Klopp was embarking on a run to the Champions League final with Dortmund.",
      "\"In the year when Sir Alex retired, they spoke to me,\" Klopp told Diary of a CEO in 2025. \"Of course, they were interested. At that time, I would’ve been interested - I was young, I had a sensational team at Dortmund. They probably thought, ‘What is he doing there?’\"",
      "He added: \"United tried [to approach me]. It was the wrong time, wrong moment. I had a contract at Dortmund and wouldn’t have left for anybody.",
      "\"There were some things in the conversations that I didn’t like. The idea was that big - ‘We get all the players we want’ - and I was sitting there thinking, this is not my project.\"",

      "The likelihood of Scott McTominay returning to Manchester United anytime soon appears to have been ruled out by Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna. Since joining the Serie A side in 2024, the Scotland international has thrived, emerging as one of Europe's most influential midfielders.",
      "McTominay played a pivotal role in Napoli's title-winning campaign last season, scoring 12 goals in 34 games and earning the accolade of Serie A's Most Valuable Player. His rapid rise in Italy has led many to call United's £30million sale one of the club's biggest transfer mistakes in recent memory.",
      "Over the past year and a half, calls for a reunion have grown among fans and reports last month even suggested a surprising comeback could be on the cards for the 29-year-old. Those speculations, however, seem to have been snuffed out by Manna, who emphasised McTominay's value when questioned about Napoli's plans in the January transfer window.",
      "\"We're waiting for [Frank] Anguissa, who is an important player, to come back,\" Manna said. \"We've missed him a lot. McTominay is showing that he can be decisive in that role. The coach will make his evaluations.\"",
      "Since arriving in Naples, McTominay has been a near constant fixture in Antonio Conte's side. While he has not matched last season's goal tally, he has still contributed in critical moments this term, netting important strikes against Inter Milan in Serie A and PSV in the Champions League.",
      "Napoli have no intention of selling their star midfielder, though some reports suggest they could entertain offers around £60m. With United seeking more energy in midfield - and with Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo possibly leaving this year - McTominay's name has inevitably been mentioned as a target.",
      "Even so, such a move seems improbable. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has emphasised his reluctance to invest heavily in older players and a transfer at that price would contradict the club's shifting strategy.",
      "Questions also remain over United's recruitment priorities following Ruben Amorim's departure, leaving it unclear which positions will be focused on in this window - if any.",
      "There is also no certainty that McTominay would be open to a return. The former United star is clearly flourishing in Italy and his role as Napoli's talisman would be hard to replicate at Old Trafford.",
      "This was, ultimately, part of the reason he left. Despite delivering consistently strong performances for both club and country during his seven years in United's senior squad, McTominay was never treated like a superstar and often played in positions that did not suit his strengths.",
      "Therefore, it increasingly looks as if McTominay's future is set in Naples, where he has found the recognition and freedom that eluded him in Manchester.",
      "For United supporters, seeing a player they once allowed to leave succeed on a bigger stage may sting - but it also underlines that a change of environment can be exactly what a player needs to reach their peak potential.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Another Manchester United gaffer has been given the boot and this time it's farewell to Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese boss only managed to hold onto his position for 14 months before being shown the door, with United just three points shy of fourth place in the Premier League.",
      "Yes, United did splash out in the summer, but new signings need time to adjust to fresh surroundings and tactics. There were glimpses of improvement under Amorim this season, even if recent results haven't quite hit the mark.",
      "Alongside recent on-pitch performances, there was allegedly a falling out between Amorim and the board. After the 1-1 draw with Leeds United, the manager sent a pointed message to the board, asserting that he was the manager, not merely the coach.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013, United have seen a revolving door of managers, with 10 different individuals, including caretakers and interims, taking the reins. David Moyes was the first successor, but his tenure didn't even span a full season, foreshadowing the difficulties future managers would face at Old Trafford.",
      "Louis van Gaal, who arrived with an impressive footballing CV, was brought in to deliver immediate success and wasn't shy about spending money. However, he too was dismissed in 2016, just two years into his stint.",
      "While two years might seem like a long stretch, let's not forget that Sir Alex himself nearly faced the sack in 1990. He went on to become a legend, bagging 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four EFL trophies and two Champions League trophies.",
      "In March 2016, before Van Gaal's departure, Ferguson shared his views on the Dutchman's situation and pointed to injuries as a key factor, backing the manager in the process.",
      "\"It is dead easy to be critical,\" Ferguson said. \"You have to be realistic about some things – the number of injuries he has had: Phil Jones has played only seven games this season, Ashley Young, [Antonio] Valencia, [Luke] Shaw, these are big losses.",
      "\"It doesn't matter which team you are, if you have players missing of that calibre it has to have an impact on the team.",
      "\"The other aspect which is always easy to forget there are also five new players in their first season at United, and two are young players in [Anthony] Martial and Memphis [Depay] and their promise is good.",
      "\"You have to have some patience being a Manchester United fan and they have shown that over the years; in Matt Busby's time, in my time. For 150 years of history, it is worth having a couple of years on the quiet side of success because they will always come back and come back strong.\"",
      "Sir Alex's observations remain just as pertinent now as they were at the time. Since Ferguson's retirement, no United boss has managed to stay in post for more than three years, leading to uncertainty and a sense of constant change at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim was on a mission to build something at United, implementing his 3-4-3 system that required time for the players to adapt. The team sat sixth in the league table, showing significant improvement from the previous season, and Champions League football was a realistic goal.",
      "The current situation sees United just a few points shy of the top four at the season's halfway mark, after finishing 15th last season. On this basis alone, the decision to sack Amorim seems harsh, regardless of off-pitch events.",
      "Ultimately, United find themselves back at square one. A new manager will have to mould a squad not of their own choosing - Ferguson may well be hoping that the next person to step into his shadow is granted the time and patience needed to finally bring success back to Old Trafford.",

      "Not long before he was sacked by Manchester United, Ruben Amorim had a phone call with Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. Amorim, 40, was dismissed from his role at Old Trafford, around 14 months after his appointment.",
      "His sacking was announced around 24 hours after his stunning press conference, where he lashed out at the Red Devils hierarchy as well as former United captain, now pundit, Gary Neville. Before his marching orders were given, Amorim was still looking to bring some new players through the door.",
      "One of them was Semenyo, who now looks set to finalise a move to Manchester City. But before the Ghanaian decided to link up with Pep Guardiola's side, Amorim was offering his vision of life at Old Trafford.",
      "According to the Times, the ex-Sporting Lisbon manager was intent on bringing Semenyo to the club. So much so, he personally spoke to the classy goal-scorer over the phone.",
      "It was believed the Cherries star was intrigued by a move to Old Trafford. However, there were purported concerns about the formation Amorim would play with Semenyo in his set-up.",
      "According to the report, the ex-Bristol City forward was concerned he may end up competing as a wing-back for United. It was then that Amorim is believed to have told him he was a flexible manager and would not necessarily be playing a 3-4-2-1 formation in the future.",
      "This is contrary to Amorim's previous comments in press conferences, where he vehemently defended his philosophy and use of the formation. In his final game in charge, the 1-1 draw against Leeds United, Amorim deployed the Red Devils in the formation despite having some success when tweaking it to a back four.",
      "Full-back Patrick Dorgu was even deployed in the front three alongside Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko. After the match, Amorim stormed out of a press conference after hitting out at the United hierarchy while also insisting he was the manager of the club, despite being listed as a head coach.",
      "When asked if he felt he had the confidence of the United board, Amorim angrily replied: \"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Neville's and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "Meanwhile, it's been claimed by the Athletic that Semenyo is close to moving to City after snubbing United. That is said to have contributed to Amorim's exit after it was made clear to the Portuguese tactician that new signings in January were off the table.",
      "Semenyo, who could be a City player in a matter of days, is expected to play his final match for the South Coast club in their upcoming clash against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday.",
      "As one of the conditions of his exit, Bournemouth reportedly insisted on holding onto him until after their clashes with Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham, with the latter being the final match.",

Not that he was wary of the qualities of Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo and others. Not that Manchester United continued to tread water under his stewardship - he neither gave them a lift nor a further nudge downwards. Not that he might have been out of his depth.",
      "No, he should remembered for being a fundamentally decent sort. And that encompasses many things. But above all, he represented the club, himself and the game very well.",
      "Unlike many others, was he seen ranting in the face of officials? Not overly.",
      "Unlike many other managers, did he milk acclaim when the players had won a game? Not overly. Unlike most, did he ever rail against officialdom after losing a match? Not overly.",
      "Was he unfailingly polite, humble and never full of himself? From what I witnessed, yes.",
      "The rush to say - after only 14 months into a three-year project - that Amorim was way out of his depth has been dispiriting to see. His statistics were not great, to be fair. Fifteen wins from 47 Premier League games. Pretty grim at a powerhouse club.",
      "But Manchester United are sixth in the table. They have played some decent stuff this season. And he seems like a good guy. Not Machiavellian. Not a poser. He was criticised by people who are paid to talk about football … for talking too much.",
      "That is because he is fundamentally civilised. Certain pundits criticised him for his performances in press conferences - pundits who would not be able to say a single word in a language that was not their mother tongue.",
      "There remains a fundamental irony in English pundits hammering foreigners for what they say when those pundits could not even imagine what it is like to answer questions in a different language. Amorim tried to answer every question. In the end, that was probably to his fault. Relatively, an innocent abroad, he was there to be tripped up.",
      "And, in the end, he was. But he has nothing to be ashamed of. He took Manchester United to a Europa League final and paid for 30 of his backroom staff and their families to attend that game in Bilbao.",
      "His team lost a poor-quality final against Spurs to a very scruffy goal. Had it gone United’s way, things might have been different.",
      "After that match, a dejected Bruno Fernandes spoke warmly about Amorim. Considering he was his captain, that was predictable. But you could tell Fernandes was genuine. And in all his dealings as United manager, Amorim seemed genuine.",
      "Was the job too big for him? Quite possibly so, although Sir Jim Ratcliffe had a point when he said Amorim should be judged over a longer period.",
      "But I suspect the Premier League has not seen the last of Amorim … and that would be no bad thing.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has emerged as a potential candidate for the Manchester United job following the collapse of his aspirations to manage Norway. Several figures have been touted for the vacant hot seat at Old Trafford following Ruben Amorim's sacking on Monday morning.",
      "An official club announcement regarding the Portuguese manager's exit read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"",
      "The club has also announced that Darren Fletcher will oversee United's fixture against Burnley on Wednesday. Although the Scot possesses coaching credentials from his time under Erik ten Hag and previously occupied the role of technical director, it marks his maiden voyage as head coach at elite level.",
      "During Solskjaer's reign, United secured sixth, third and second-place league positions. With the 52-year-old recently parting ways with Besiktas, he would be available to return to Old Trafford in a temporary capacity.",
      "Discussing a possible appointment, former teammate, Ronny Johnsen, said: \"It is logical that his name comes up in the discussion. He has experience with the club and knows the culture.\"",
      "Meanwhile, ex-Tottenham goalkeeper, Erik Thorstvedt, added: \"It would be unusual for a club like Manchester United, which is used to getting what they point to. I would be very surprised if Ole Gunnar returns. Although I know that many have reminisced about how good they were under him.\"",
      "This development follows Solskjaer's recent disappointment in missing out on managing his homeland Norway, after Ståle Solbakken signed a contract extension with the national side until 2028. Whether he would consider taking on a caretaker position with his former Premier League employers, though, is yet to be determined.",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is tipped to be the next permanent gaffer at Old Trafford. The Austrian has had a successful stint at Selhurst Park and his name has been associated with the United job for a while now.",
      "However, with his contract running until this summer, it's unclear whether United are planning to wait until then to avoid paying compensation to Palace and maintain good relations. In other news, ex-Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is rumoured to be considering a quick return to management with the Red Devils.",
      "The Italian left Chelsea last week by mutual agreement, after leading the club to a Europa Conference League title and the Club World Cup last summer. In response, Chelsea have named Liam Rosenior as their new first-team manager.",
      "Other potential candidates include Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, La Liga greats Zinedine Zidane and Xavi, and former England manager Gareth Southgate.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Pep Guardiola reckons that Ruben Amorim was close to turning Manchester United into Premier League title challengers - but results didn't go his way. United announced Amorim's sacking on Monday, with the Portuguese having fallen out with director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "Confirmation came less than 24 hours after United were held to a 1-1 draw away to Leeds, although the decision is understood to have been made before Sunday's trip to Elland Road. United missed the chance to go fourth in the table, having dropped points in nine of their last 11 fixtures.",
      "Guardiola pointed out that had United won games in which they were favourites, they could be 'close to' leaders Arsenal, just like his Manchester City side are. \"I don't think there's a country where if you don't win games you are safe,\" the City manager explained.",
      "\"Normally if you don't get results it doesn't matter the past or the present. They hire you with a perspective for your ideas and you are sacked for results.",
      "\"Sometimes you need a process and time. At United, they draw three games at home - against Everton who had 10 against 11 for 70 minutes, against Bournemouth and Wolves. They could have been close to Arsenal.",
      "\"The gaps are so small and now you see United have had a lot of absences like we have right now and it's difficult with players at the Africa Cup of Nations and important players not available.\"",
      "Guardiola added: \"Like what happened with Enzo (Maresca) I cannot say anything for the respect of the players and institutions. Like Enzo, he (Amorim) is a top manager. The decision has been made by our neighbours. I wish Ruben all the best in the future.\"",
      "United said that sacking Amorim will improve their chances of achieving 'the highest possible Premier League finish'. \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United,\" their statement read.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously claimed he would \"say yes every day of the week\" if Manchester United came calling for a second time.",
      "The Norwegian spent almost three years in charge at Old Trafford before he was sacked in November 2021. He secured third and second place finishes during his tenure and reached a Europa League final before things fell apart in his final weeks. Solskjaer, scorer of the goal that won United the Champions League in 1999, regularly referenced his love for the club and its traditions during his time in charge - and he has reiterated that fondness in the years since his departure.",
      "It was in September 2024, when Erik ten Hag was still in charge, that Solskjaer admitted during a Q&A at the Oslo Business Forum that he would answer the call - whenever, wherever - if it came his way again.",
      "He said: \"If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week. It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",
      "Solskjaer is currently among the bookies favourite to be the next permanent manager in Manchester. Oliver Glasner is another man heavily linked with the role but the Austrian is at Crystal Palace, who want to keep him, whilst Solskjaer is a man out of a job and readily available.",
      "He won 91 of his 168 games, leaving him with a win percentage of 54. Above the likes of Ruben Amorim and David Moyes. It was Erik ten Hag who would eventually replace Solskjaer on a permanent basis after the Norwegian was sacked following a humiliating loss at Watford.",
      "He's since had a brief stint at Besiktas, but during his time at Old Trafford built a team that, on paper, had people taking United up. He signed the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes - the latter proving a huge success.",
      "Solskjaer said when he left: \"The board and the owners have backed me in [terms of] bringing good people in, good players in and I think, or I know, I leave this club with a better squad. The environment is fantastic, it’s an environment I’m proud of leaving because you have to enjoy coming in here working.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is in contention for a sensational return to Manchester United following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese coach was given his marching orders on Monday after a fallout with sporting director Jason Wilcox.",
      "Under-18s boss Darren Fletcher has been appointed on a temporary basis as United consider their options and hold talks with potential candidates. An interim appointment until the end of the season is on the cards, with club legend Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the frame. Solskjaer previously held the reins for nearly three years, initially as caretaker and then permanently, from December 2018 to November 2021.",
      "Despite some criticism, Solskjaer led United to third and second place finishes in his two full seasons at the helm, a stark contrast to recent seasons of turmoil and underperformance. If he does make a comeback, here are some of the players he could potentially lure back to Old Trafford....",
      "A player who earned Solskjaer's trust and, in retrospect, should have been kept on. Even before Amorim's departure, there were whispers that United might be keen to re-sign the Scottish international, given the team's need for midfield reinforcements.",
      "Due to his stellar performances in Serie A, Napoli are not keen to part ways with McTominay. However, reports suggest they might consider offers of around £60m, twice the amount United sold him for. Solskjaer would undoubtedly welcome the homegrown star back, having criticised the decision to let him go.",
      "The decision to let club legend De Gea leave still irks some United fans, particularly given the goalkeeping problems the club has faced with Andre Onana and, to a lesser extent, Altay Bayindir.",
      "Senne Lammens has settled well since joining last summer, so 35-year-old De Gea, now at Fiorentina, wouldn't expect to reclaim the number one spot immediately. Nonetheless, having such an experienced and respected figure around the club would bring numerous benefits, whether he plays or not.",
      "Rashford is still technically a United player, having been loaned out to Barcelona over the summer. However, reuniting him with Solskjaer would feel like signing a new player.",
      "Rashford thrived under Solskjaer, netting 55 goals in 135 appearances, the most games any player has had under the Norwegian. This is a stark contrast to his relationship with Amorim, which deteriorated within weeks, leading to Rashford being exiled from the first-team squad.",
      "It seemed unthinkable that Rashford would play for United again under Amorim, but under Solskjaer? United have no means of recalling Rashford this month, so any move would depend on Barcelona's co-operation. A summer return seems more likely, but the England striker's future at United has taken a dramatic turn since Amorim was sacked.",
      "The right-back was a fixture in the starting line-up under Solskjaer, making over 100 appearances and earning the nickname 'The Spider' for his exceptional tackling reach and ability to regain possession.",
      "However, his career at Old Trafford took a downturn under Erik ten Hag before he was sold to West Ham for £15million, just a third of what United paid Crystal Palace for him. Wan-Bissaka put in an excellent performance as the Hammers secured a 1-1 draw against United recently, while Fletcher is a fan.",
      "After being one of West Ham's standout players in a challenging season, he's attracting attention from other clubs, including Inter Milan. But would a return to Old Trafford under Solskjaer be appealing?",

      "Darren Fletcher will add to that number when he leads United out as interim head coach against Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday and the 41-year-old Scot has also held talks with the club over the role. United sacked head coach Ruben Amorim on Monday and are set to appoint a caretaker for the remainder of the season, after which they will look to find a permanent successor.",
      "Fletcher said on the eve of the trip to Burnley that he would hold further talks over his future after that game, but United have sounded out Solskjaer, Carrick and Van Nistelrooy over the job.",
      "It is Solskjaer who is emerging as the leading candidate, having made it clear he is desperate to return to Old Trafford, having been sacked as manager in November 2021. The Norwegian came in as interim boss to replace Jose Mourinho in November 2018 and engineered a significant upturn in fortunes, earning him the job on a permanent basis.",
      "His tenure wasn't always smooth, but he guided United to finishes of third and second in two full seasons in charge, before a dramatic slump in his third campaign saw him dismissed after a 4-1 loss at Watford. Solskjaer has more managerial experience than Carrick, Fletcher and Van Nistelrooy and his win record of 54% across 168 games compares well with Amorim's 38%.",
      "Carrick was on Solskjaer's staff during his time in charge and stepped in to replace the club legend after he was sacked. The 44-year-old oversaw two wins and a draw from his three games in charge before leaving when Ralf Rangnick was appointed.",
      "The former midfielder, who made 464 appearances for the club, has since managed Middlesbrough but is available after leaving the Riverside Stadium at the end of last season.",
      "Van Nistelrooy's spell in charge began after he remained in place following the sacking of Erik ten Hag in October 2024. The Dutchman had a record of three wins and a draw from four games and has since had a brief spell at Leicester City before leaving in June 2025.",

So that's good news, especially the fact that obviously players who have been in good form, Mason Mount's form has been fantastic and Bruno Fernandes, you don't have to speak about Bruno, he's the captain, he's the leader of the team, so to have them available for selection is obviously great news for me and for the players and for the club and for the fans.\"",

It is their season, their careers, it is their opportunity and I am here to help them but they are the ones who have to cross that white line and go on that pitch and make it happen so we will give them some responsibility to go and do that.",
      "Mason [Mount] and Bruno [Fernandes] were pushing to play against Leeds and the decision was that they weren't quite ready. So they have trained and they should be back in the squad. They are on managed minutes and restricted minutes because they have only just returned to training so that is good news, especially because they are players who have been in good form. Mason Mount's form has been fantastic and Bruno Fernandes... you don't have to speak about him. He's the captain, the leader of the team. To have them available for selection is obviously great news for me, the players and the club and the fans.",
      "For a game it is to win a match vs Burnley. I have had a few different roles at the club. Obviously coaching the U21s, U18s just now but my focus and energy has been to do the best for United and try to help the club, help the team, the people I work with, the players, the staff and try to do everything I can to make Manchester United successful. Everyone expects United to be at the top and winning, that's the standard. That's what we all have to try and achieve. That's the standard that is set for everyone at the club, and I just do my best in whatever role I am in to help make that happen.",
      "Travis Binnion, who leads the U21s and who I started my coaching career with in the academy, who I have known for five years here and I could not ask for anyone better beside me than Travis, we have such a close relationship, working together for such a long time. Somebody who I respect, who I have learnt a lot from. His assistant Alan Wright who has newly joined the club will come and join me as will Jonny Evans. Somebody who has great association with the club, recently played, knows the players, comfortable in the environment and a familiar face for the group as well. So those three will assist me.",
      "Honestly it is not what I have thought about. Focusing on Burnley, that discussion is for after the game. It has all happened so quickly so all my concentration is on Burnley. I know it is a generic answer but it is what it is yeah.",
      "Focus on this game and then speak after the game. It all happened very quickly on Monday with a game to prepare and a quick turnaround, training session to organise, speak to the players. The focus is on the Burnley game as I think that we give the Burnley match the respect and focus it deserves to prepare the team in such a short space of time.",
      "Surreal. It is an amazing honour to lead a Manchester United team especially as it was not in my wildest dreams that would be something which could potentially happen. To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do but not in the circumstances I expected it to happy so that is something which doesn't sit quite easy with me. But, I have just got to think I have a job to do and I just have to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.",
      "Fletcher is here and the press conference is underway. Stay tuned for what he has to say...",
      "So with plenty to ask Fletcher, here is what we reckon will be on the agenda in this press conference:",
      "Imagine the memes if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is pictured at Old Trafford in the next week or two, scarf above his head, club crest on his breast pocket and nostalgia in the air once again. It would be a social media field day for opposition supporters. But that wouldn't necessarily make it the wrong call. In fact, for a club looking to stall its decision on another permanent manager until the end of the season, it might be the really obvious one. And Manchester United have learnt their lesson when it comes to turning Solskjaer from interim to the king of the castle.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "We are not far off discovering what Fletcher has to say in his first press conference as interim manager. The Scot could be asked about a host of topics this evening but we can expect his predecessor to be mentioned.",
      "United have no plans to change their approach to the January transfer window in the wake of Ruben Amorim's sudden departure as head coach on Monday morning. United's spending plans were a source of conflict between Amorim and technical director Jason Wilcox in the final weeks of the Portuguese's reign at Old Trafford. Amorim had said in December that the club would consider making a move for a player in the January window, and they were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo, who had a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract.",
      "United would have paid that had the 25-year-old opted to move to Old Trafford, but Semenyo has opted for a move to Manchester City instead. That led a downbeat Amorim to say on Friday there were \"no conversations\" about signing players in January as he suggested the squad would be unchanged during the window.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "We are just one hour away from what could be a highly compelling first press conference with Fletcher as interim manager. The Scot will face the media for the first time as a senior head coach shortly...",
      "Glasner has played down links with the vacant head coach role at Manchester United and insisted he wouldn't answer questions on the links with the Old Trafford role. The current Crystal Palace boss has emerged as a leading contender for the job after Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday, following a string of disappointing results and a falling out with director of football Jason Wilcox. Glasner has admirers within Old Trafford and is understood to be interested in the job. He is out of contract at Crystal Palace at the end of this season and is set to walk away from Selhurst Park then. The 51-year-old has enjoyed an excellent spell in South London, winning the club's first major honour last season after they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final, although he has also been outspoken about recruitment issues at Palace.",
      "He is one of the favourites to land the United job on a permanent basis, but when asked if people should be putting money on him to take over at Old Trafford, he dodged the question and tried to change the subject.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Another name on the potentials list as caretaker manager is Michael Carrick. He had the caretaker job for three games after Solskjaer was sacked and managed to produce two wins and a draw before leaving. Most recently, the Reds' former midfielder was in charge of Championship club Middlesbrough but left them in June after leading them to tenth.",
      "It's fair to say there wasn't a slide for this in the PowerPoint presentation for 'Project 150', the grandiose title Ineos have come up with to take United back to the top of English football. Unveiled in September 2024, Project 150 is the stated aim of United winning the league in their 150th anniversary season of 2027/28. Appointing a new head coach 15 months later, after a complete breakdown in relations, wasn't part of the plan. As much as key figures around Old Trafford are keen to pin the blame on Ruben Amorim for what has happened recently, Ratcliffe and his key lieutenants can't escape scot free either. They have botched the first major decision the new football structure had to make and it feels like they are back to square one. Ratcliffe has now cycled through a director of football and a head coach already. It's not a great look.",

      "Rio Ferdinand had his say on who he would like in the Old Trafford dugout next. Any of these take your fancy United fans?",
      "While the press conference is likely to be dominated by the managerial situation, we may also get updates on the squad's fitness heading into the trip to Turf Moor. Mainoo, Mount, Fernandes, Maguire and De Ligt have all been missing in recent weeks due to injury. One or more of them returning to full fitness would be a welcome boost for the Reds as they look to get back to winning ways against Burnley.",
      "Speaking of caretaker managers, one of the names under consideration at United is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The Norwegian is still popular with the United fans since his time at the club ended in disappointment. He did exceptionally well as an interim before being given the position full time in March 2019. Solskjaer won all of his opening eight matches in interim charge and if he was to repeat that in 2026, United would be in a strong position for a Champions League spot next season.",
      "It is expected Fletcher will be in charge for the Burnley game as well as the FA Cup clash against Brighton on Sunday. Beyond that, it remains to be seen how long he will be in the dugout for. By then, it is expected Wilcox and Berrada will have a plan of action for the coming months. One option could be to appoint a caretaker manager until the end of the season.",
      "Oliver Glasner is a leading contender to replace Ruben Amorim as Manchester United head coach. The current Crystal Palace boss plays a back three but that isn't expected to count against him when Old Trafford chiefs consider who to appoint next. Glasner is out of contract at Palace in the summer and could join without compensation then. United could make an approach for the Austrian this month, but given that Glasner threatened to quit in the summer when Marc Guehi was nearly sold to Liverpool, it is unlikely to go down well at Selhurst Park if he agitates to leave now.",

      "United are set to approach Jonny Evans over a coaching role under Darren Fletcher as the Scot finalises his staff for Wednesday's Premier League fixture with Burnley. The former United midfielder oversaw a smaller training session on Monday but will step up preparations for the visit to Turf Moor today. Under-21s head coach Travis Binnion and academy coach Alan Wright, who recently joined from Manchester City, will also step up to form part of Fletcher's first-team staff.",

Fletcher wanted to spend the day organising a coaching team for the remainder of the week before completing his media duties.",

      "Under-18s head coach Darren Fletcher will take interim charge and is set to hold his first press conference at 5pm later today, ahead of United's trip to Burnley. With regard to potential long-term successors, Oliver Glasner has emerged as the early favourite as he is expected to depart Crystal Palace at the end of the season.",

      "Jose Mourinho has revealed only Ruben Amorim will know the true reason behind his Manchester United exit.",
      "“What happened with Rúben is something that only Rúben can analyse,” Mourinho said to Portuguese outlet O Jogo. “I believe he will do it, he and his staff. Whether he will do it with you and make his view public, that I do not know.”",
      "Darren Fletcher has been told he will be in charge for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley on Wednesday night before a decision is made on his role later in the week. Fletcher was asked to step up as interim head coach on Monday following the decision to sack Ruben Amorim and his coaching staff and he took his first training session later that day, but talks over extending his role are on hold until the game at Turf Moor.",
      "The Scot confirmed he had added Travis Binnion, Alan Wright and former centre-back Jonny Evans to his coaching staff but revealed he had only been told he would be in charge for one game so far after a conversation with director of football Jason Wilcox.",

      "United's best option to replace Ruben Amorim is Enzo Maresca. The Italian's departure from Chelsea may have drawn similarities with Amorim's acrimonious split with United and that may stop the club's hierarchy from hiring him.",
      "But unlike Amorim, Maresca has a proven track record of success in English football. His work at Leicester City was impressive - comfortably guiding them back into the Premier League.",
      "His record with Chelsea is what makes him stand out though. Winning trophies at a club which struggled to win silverware in recent seasons, as well as guiding the Blues back into the Champions League, should put him top of United's shortlist.",
      "Not to mention the experience he has of working with Chelsea's youthful squad - a tradition important to United - makes him a good fit. There are still question marks over whether he would be good enough to guide a team to win the biggest trophies.",
      "However, similar accusations could be levelled at Arsenal's Mikel Arteta, and he's at least made the Gunners a competent title-challenging team who are Champions League regulars again. For where United currently are - Maresca's the man.",

      "He said: \"Ruben Amorim's wages were considerably lower than those of other Premier League managers, likely due to the cost of releasing him from his Sporting Lisbon contract.",
      "\"Intuitively, a figure of £12million seems appropriate for his contract, though it's unclear if this covers only him or his entire backroom team, who all came with him.",
      "\"However, when you consider the total package to replace Amorim, this figure could quickly rise to £50m based on the estimated costs Manchester United made by sacking and replacing Erik ten Hag with Amorim.",
      "\"This is a sum Manchester United would likely prefer not to spend in a single year, particularly when the club is implementing redundancies elsewhere.\"",

      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and invested £200m - buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, that's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now.",

      "As early as October last year - while Amorim was still at the helm - it was reported that former England manager Southgate was contemplating whether to vie for the managerial role at Old Trafford.",

      "You’ve got Dave Brailsford in there but the club has been a mess for so many years now and I do feel sorry for Ruben [Amorim].",
      "[Crystal] Palace fans won’t like me for saying this, but letting your manager go down to six months left on his contract is worrying for them, because I think Oliver Glasner could be someone that can get Man United back on track if the people above him let him do his job.",
      "Is there a system in place behind the scenes? Are they going to work together? Can they work together? What’s that relationship like long-term? You can have the best Manager in the world and the best Director of Football in the world, and the best Sports Scientists, but if they don’t work together, it can’t work.",
      "Speaking on the The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Paul Scholes has offered his thoughts on Enzo Maresca potentially replacing Ruben Amorim at Manchester United.",
      "Enzo Maresca leaving Chelsea might have spooked Ruben Amorim a bit because of the relationship he has with the ex-Man City people in Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada",
      "Is Maresca the right man for Man United? I don’t see it. He’s that Man City style of manager. People have been speculating about Pep leaving, he’s lasted at City longer than any other club so that’s why people think at some point he’s going to go.",
      "Maresca does feel like a really good replacement for him at Man City. He doesn’t feel right for Man United but he does for Man City.",
      "I wouldn’t be surprised if it was Enzo Maresca [that replaced Amorim], it really wouldn’t surprise me. I just think the connection is there, they might think it’s a safe bet given they know him. But he’s left Chelsea because he didn’t have total control – is he going to come to United given why Amorim left?",

      "Seeing lot of hear say stories this morning on Amorim, players + heirachy, arguments etc. This is normal - I would be annoyed if there weren’t. You need an environment where difficult conversations were had, players wanting to win!",
      "This is a regular occurrence in Any dressing room, training pitch wanting to be successful !!! Amorim is a good man/manager and he will come again - the club have made the decision to look elsewhere. There’s been progress built on last season…but not enough in enough areas.",
      "There will be more pressure now on the players and they have to step up and show spirit, fight and be brave with the ball to get through this moment in the season.",
      "What an opportunity for Darren Fletcher - the players will respond to him and if we see a bit of Darren Fletcher in the teams performance that will be a positive step.",

      "Oliver Glasner has emerged as a frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Portuguese departs Old Trafford after criticising the United hierarchy following his side's draw at Leeds United on Sunday.",
      "But one of the names being linked with replacing Amorim is Glasner, who not only guided Crystal Palace to FA Cup glory last term, but has also already entered the last six months of his contract at Selhurst Park. And when he was asked directly about rumours linking him with United and other 'top clubs' by the Austrian edition of Kicker back in September, Glasner refused to rule out replacing Amorim at Old Trafford."

      "Manchester United have added former centre-back Jonny Evans to the new-look coaching staff because of his recent links to the first-team squad and his history with the club. Evans retired as a player after his second spell at Old Trafford came to an end following the 2024/25 season. He went straight into a role as head of loans and pathway but left that position just a month ago.",
      "But Monday's decision to sack Ruben Amorim and almost the entire first-team coaching staff has left United short on bodies. Under-18s head coach Darren Fletcher has taken charge of first-team affairs, with Travis Binnion and Alan Wright also promoted.",
      "Evans has returned in a coaching capacity and will be in the dugout at Turf Moor on Wednesday. The 38-year-old is expected to stay on for the rest of the season as United consider an interim appointment until the end of the campaign.",
      "He made 241 appearances for United across two spells at the club and will know plenty of these players having been part of the dressing room recently, including under Amorim.",
      "\"Johnny Evans has come in to help as well, so somebody who's a great association with the club, recently played, knows the players, comfortable in the environment, and a familiar face for the group and the players as well, so those three will assist me for the game tomorrow,\" said Fletcher.",
      "The 41-year-old Scot is also grateful to have Binnion and Wright alongside him, with the latter only joining the club from Manchester City in recent months. \"Travis Binnion, who leads the Under-21s, who I started my coaching career with in the academy, who I've known for five years that I've been here, I actually couldn't ask for anybody better beside me than Travis,\" Fletcher said. \"We've got such a close relationship, worked together for such a long time, somebody I respect, somebody who I've learned a lot from.",
      "\"His assistant, Alan Wright, who newly joined the club as well, so the Under-21 staff come and join me.\"",
      "Fletcher will lead out United at Burnley in what is his first taste of senior management experience, but he is keen to make the occasion about the players rather than himself.",
      "United lacked an attacking identity under Amorim and Fletcher wants to see a side against the Clarets that supporters can be proud of.",
      "\"Well, hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me,\" he said. \"So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of. And I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.",
      "\"I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team. And I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves and to show that. And also to challenge them.",
      "\"It's about them, it's not about me. It's their season, it's their careers, it's their opportunity. I'm here to help them, but they're the ones who have to cross that white line and go on the pitch and make it happen. So give them some responsibility to go and do that.\"",

      "Solskjaer left Besiktas in August after the Turkish side crashed out of the Conference League. It's also understood that the Norwegian is now a strong contender to return to Old Trafford.",
      "The 52-year-old was pictured today at a Waitrose store in Wilmslow, Cheshire, near his home in the area. Solskjaer, who was a teammate of Darren Fletcher as a player, is being considered to take control of United until the end of the season.",
      "Solskjaer is emerging as a leading candidate, having made it clear he is desperate to return to the club. During his previous period in charge of the club, Solskjaer recorded successive top league finishes in the Premier League - the club's first since Sir Alex Ferguson - and reached the Europa League final, losing to Villarreal.",
      "He also led them to a second-placed finish in 2021, something only he and Mourinho have achieved since Ferguson retired in 2013. In his playing days, the former Cardiff City boss made more than 200 appearances, winning six Premier League titles and the famous treble in 1999.",
      "It's understood that United are pursuing an interim solution until the end of the season before finding a permanent head coach for the 2026/27 season. Fletcher is set to take charge of Wednesday night's Premier League clash with Burnley and Sunday's FA Cup game with Brighton.",

The current Crystal Palace boss has emerged as a leading contender for the job after Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday, following a string of disappointing results and a falling out with director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "Glasner has admirers within Old Trafford and is understood to be interested in the job. He is out of contract at Crystal Palace at the end of this season and is set to walk away from Selhurst Park then. The 51-year-old has enjoyed an excellent spell in South London, winning the club's first major honour last season after they beat Manchester City in the FA Cup final, although he has also been outspoken about recruitment issues at Palace.",
      "He is one of the favourites to land the United job on a permanent basis, but when asked if people should be putting money on him to take over at Old Trafford, he dodged the question and tried to change the subject. \"I am not allowed to bet. My contract has one paragraph that I am not allowed to bet. And I don’t look at it,\" said Glasner.",
      "“I also cannot give insider information. That would also be breaking my contract. I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask more questions about it.\"",

      "Much of the focus at Manchester United right now is on who will replace Ruben Amorim - but that hasn't stopped speculation over potential new signings.",
      "This comes despite Amorim hinting at limited January investment just days before being dismissed. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team for Wednesday's Premier League clash with Burnley, with a successor expected to be named later in the month.",
      "During last year's winter transfer window, United were relatively inactive. Ayden Heaven arrived from Arsenal's academy, followed later by Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The club reportedly have several targets, particularly in midfield, with players like Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson high on their wish-list. Current indications suggest a January splurge is unlikely, particularly with the club spending over £200million on new talent in the summer.",
      "That said, the Red Devils are expected to explore several possibilities, with various areas of the squad in need of bolstering. Here, we examine the latest transfer updates surrounding Old Trafford.",
      "While United may have to wait until the summer to make major investments, more creative deals could still be explored in the interim. One option involves RB Leipzig defender El Chadaille Bitshiabu, with L'Equipe reporting that the Red Devils could propose a loan with an option to buy.",
      "However, they are unlikely to be the only club interested. Bayer Leverkusen are reportedly considering a similar arrangement, Monaco are also in pursuit due to a defensive injury crisis and Lyon are said to be involved as well.",
      "There is a bigger complication, though. Earlier reports from Bild suggest Leipzig are unwilling to allow the young centre-back to leave in January, whether on loan or permanently.",
      "Bitshiabu returned from a hamstring injury in December but has only seen limited action this season. Just three of his five appearances have been in the league, with Castello Lukeba and Willi Orban ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Bitshiabu's team-mate Yan Diomande's impressive start at RB Leipzig has seen him attract attention across Europe too, but a January move away also appears unlikely. Diomande joined Leipzig from Leganes in the summer and has quickly made an impact, notably scoring a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt in early December.",
      "According to The Athletic, United are one of two Premier League clubs interested in him, with Tottenham also reportedly monitoring the Ivorian winger. Leipzig are expected to demand up to £86m, with several unnamed European clubs also showing interest.",
      "Premier League teams have had inconsistent results when signing players from Leipzig in recent windows. Josko Gvardiol and Dominik Szoboszlai have thrived for Manchester City and Liverpool, respectively, but attackers have not been as successful.",
      "The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko, who joined United from the Bundesliga side last window, while Timo Werner and Christopher Nkunku struggled to replicate their Leipzig form at Chelsea. Both forwards were eventually sold at a loss, with Werner returning to Leipzig and Nkunku moving to AC Milan.",

      "Fletcher has been appointed interim head coach at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday and that has left him little time to put together a team to support him in what is his first senior head coach role.",
      "The former United midfielder oversaw a smaller training session on Monday but will step up preparations for the visit to Turf Moor today. Under-21s head coach Travis Binnion and academy coach Alan Wright, who recently joined from Manchester City, will also step up to form part of Fletcher's first-team staff.",
      "Amorim brought an army of coaches with him from Sporting, and they all departed the club on Monday. They include assistant head coach Carlos Fernandes, first-team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The only member of the first-team coaching staff staying at Old Trafford in the wake of Amorim's departure is goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson. The 46-year-old has been at United for six years, having joined the club from Wednesday's opponents Burnley in late 2019.",
      "Evans, who left his role as United's head of loans and pathway just a month ago, could return as part of the first-team coaching staff and might be back in time to be involved against the Clarets. He is expected to stay on until the end of the season.",
      "The centre-back retired at the end of the 2024/25 season after two spells at the club as a player and his knowledge of United is considered valuable. Evans played with Fletcher, who will get a chance to show his credentials this week after stepping up from his role as Under-18s head coach.",
      "Fletcher was a first-team coach under Erik ten Hag and had previously served as the technical director at United. This is his first experience in management, and as a result, the club are weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",
      "Solskjaer recently left his job at Besiktas and Carrick is out of work after leaving Middlesbrough. Both have more experience than Fletcher having been in the Old Trafford hotseat before.",
      "Fletcher will hold his first press conference at the later time of 5pm on Tuesday. United sought Premier League approval to push the press conference back, with league guidelines usually insisting press conferences should start no later than 1.30pm the day before the game, or on a Friday if it is a weekend fixture.",
      "Fletcher is keen to get his feet under the table today and sort out the identity of his staff and plans for the trip to Turf Moor, before then undertaking his round of media engagements.",

      "Imagine the memes if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is pictured at Old Trafford in the next week or two, scarf above his head, club crest on his breast pocket and nostalgia in the air once again. It would be a social media field day for opposition supporters.",
      "But that wouldn't necessarily make it the wrong call. In fact, for a club looking to stall its decision on another permanent manager until the end of the season, it might be the really obvious one. And Manchester United have learnt their lesson when it comes to turning Solskjaer from interim to the king of the castle.",
      "This week, Darren Fletcher will get his go. The midfielder with 342 appearances to his name will follow in the footsteps of Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy as former players to get a go in the dugout in recent years.",
      "Fletcher knows the club inside out. He spent 20 years at Old Trafford as a player, has served as technical director, first-team coach, and Under-18s head coach. There isn't a nook or cranny of this place he can't navigate to.",
      "But this is his first time in the hot seat for any club, and it comes at a crucial time. United are three points off fourth and four points off 14th, so while the Champions League is within reach, so is the bottom half of the table. It would be a risk to leave a 41-year-old with no management experience in charge for the second half of the season.",
      "That makes someone with experience all the more appealing and Solskjaer ticks that box. For all the criticism thrown at the Norwegian, he has managed 471 games, of which 168 were at United. He has added to that experience with seven months in the goldfish bowl of Turkish football with Beşiktaş.",
      "He left that role in August and is available again. Solskjaer would be interested in returning to United in a caretaker role and his name is under consideration as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox consider their next move.",
      "Solskjaer has experience of lifting a group following a mid-season sacking. He inherited a squad relieved to see the back of Jose Mourinho in December 2018, so the circumstances are a little different, but he showed his light-touch approach can pay immediate dividends.",
      "He won his first eight games as interim boss, and lost only one of his first 17, culminating in that magical night in Paris in March 2019. That made his appointment as a permanent boss a fait accompli. In hindsight, it was almost certainly a mistake, although his reign wasn't the disaster it is often portrayed as, and it stacks up well against what has followed since.",
      "Solskjaer's win rate of 54% is almost identical to Erik ten Hag's but is comfortably better than Ralf Rangnick's and Ruben Amorim's. He also guided United to second in 2020/21, reaching the Europa League final and the League Cup semi-final.",
      "The failure to get over the line and win a trophy was probably rightly held against Solskjaer. He lacked something that the very best managers have at the highest level. That runner-up finish also has an asterisk next to it, with that season played out in empty stadiums, which seemed to suit United.",
      "But it's also true that the progress he felt was coming was destabilised by the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. It forced Solskjaer to rip up the tactical framework he had built. Solskjaer would never criticise a United legend and Ronaldo's legion of super fans would reject the idea, but it would have been interesting to see the evolution of Solskjaer's team without his signing.",
      "We will never know now, and when the end came, it was the right call. Solskjaer had run out of road and United needed a better, more experienced manager in charge. They still do.",
      "That might have to wait, however. It makes sense for United to make an appointment in the summer, when Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, and Oliver Glasner are out of contract at Fulham, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace, respectively, while Thomas Tuchel could leave England after the World Cup.",
      "The pool of potential head coaches will be greater in the summer and United should be able to land their man without paying compensation. If they need a safe pair of hands until then, Solskjaer's credentials are strong.",

      "Manchester United are on the hunt for a new head coach after parting ways with Ruben Amorim on Monday morning. In a statement, the club wrote: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"",
      "While Darren Fletcher has been named as taking over Amorim's duties for Wednesday's clash with Burnley, it remains to be seen as to whether the club will afford him the rest of the season before appointing a full-time head coach in the summer. Elsewhere, Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have recently been touted as potential caretakers for the rest of 2025/26, with an update on the latter emerging on Tuesday afternoon claiming he had been 'sounded out'.",
      "Here, the MEN looks at all of the names which have been linked with taking up tenure at Manchester United as of recent, as well as the bookmakers' odds...",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is currently favourite to take up tenure at Manchester United. The Norwegian enjoyed a three-year stint with the club between 2018 and 2021 and has already demonstrated that he can hold his own in the Premier League. An interim or caretaker role until season's end is the most likely scenario, but it remains to be seen as to whether that would interest Solskjaer.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has also been linked with being next in line for the United hot seat. The Austrian said of the role in September: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Out of contract at Selhurst Park this summer, a move to United any sooner looks bleak considering Glasner's commitment to the club.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins of the first-team for United's clash with Burnley on Wednesday. However, the club could afford him the rest of the season on an interim basis depending on how he fares this week, as they continue to search for a full-time appointment.",
      "Out of the managerial game since stepping down from the England national team last summer, Gareth Southgate has been linked with a role with the Reds for some time now. It is unknown whether he would be willing to step up in an interim job, or whether a permanent role would solely appeal to him at present.",
      "Enzo Maresca could be set for a return to Premier League management just a week after leaving Chelsea. The Italian head coach has a solid resume with the Blues, including a Europa Conference League title and last summer's Club World Cup win.",
      "An appointment for Thomas Tuchel is highly unlikely at present, considering the German is currently preparing to guide England to glory at the 2026 World Cup. However, his name has been put out there by the bookies.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino has also found himself highlighted as a suitable candidate to guide United to glory. The Argentine has experience in the Premier League with both Chelsea and Tottenham, although is currently tied up with the USA national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "Michael Carrick has been out of a job since he was sacked by Middlesbrough last summer, and given his past affiliation with the Reds, could work as a caretaker until season's end. He has previously worked in a caretaker role, and will know what is expected by the board.",
      "Barcelona legend, Xavi, is another name which has been mentioned with regard to taking up a head coach role at Old Trafford. The La Liga legend has enjoyed managerial stints at Al Sadd and at the Camp Nou, but has never managed - nor played for - an English team.",
      "Currently in charge of Ipswich, who are third in the Championship standings, Kieran McKenna is also a bit of a longshot for the job. However, given he has previously worked at the club as an assistant to Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, he could be a good fit should he have his head turned."

      "Gary Neville has given his verdict on Ruben Amorim’s exit from Manchester United, naming which match was the \"killer game\" for the club's former head coach. United announced on Monday that the club had parted ways with Amorim after 14 months in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim was recently asked about the confidence he received from United's hierarchy, where the 40-year-old gave a lengthy explanation on his role at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything,\" Amorim said after United’s draw with Leeds on Sunday. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "\"Look, if there was a meeting on Friday morning about the performance against Wolves between the sporting director and the manager - I'd actually have been disappointed if there wasn't a meeting after the Wolves performance,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I think as a sporting director or owner of a football club, you should be entitled to go and speak to a manager when the team have played like they have against Wolves and basically Wolves have picked up a point at Old Trafford, only their third of the season.",
      "\"It seems to me that in the last week, Ruben Amorim has decided that he doesn't feel supported or he doesn't feel happy, he's called it out obviously in press conferences, decided to unleash at times and sort of be emotional and do what he does: I think he's always been honest, he's always done it with integrity, he's always speaking from the heart - we always enjoy his press conferences.",
      "\"But the reality of it is, when you turn on your bosses - it doesn't matter whether you're at a football club or you work in Morrisons - if you turn on your bosses, you're not going to keep your job very long.",
      "\"For me, the meeting between Jason Wilcox and Ruben Amorim after the Wolves game that took place, that absolutely would take place in every single football club.",
      "\"If Salford City had a game that they lost or drew that was bad, there would be a conversation between the sporting department and the manager, just like there would be from the manager to the sporting department if we weren't getting our targets in the January transfer window.",
      "\"These are conversations that have to happen, there has to be a level of honesty that occurs when there are disappointing results.",
      "\"Over the last five or six weeks, I've done probably every United game other than the Leeds and Crystal Palace games, and I've actually complimented United when I think they've performed well: against Bournemouth, when they drew 4-4, against Villa when they lost was a disappointing result but I thought there was something in the performance.",
      "\"But some of the performances in the last month... if you look at the Everton game, losing to 10 men when to be fair Ruben Amorim kept three at the back against one and they were basically trying to chase a goal against 10-man Everton.",
      "\"The performance against West Ham - everyone is beating West Ham and Manchester United drew at home and to be fair West Ham could've got more out of the game. Everyone is beating Wolves, Manchester United drew against Wolves.",
      "\"So if you look at some of the performances in the last month, they've been shocking. However, there have been some bright spots along the way.",
      "\"I actually thought against Leeds it was a decent performance, I thought it was a good point and he could have handled it differently after the game in the press conference but he didn't. The Wolves game to me seemed like the killer game, it was a bad one.\"",
      "Neville then turned to where United must go next after Amorim’s sacking, and why he was surprised by the departure.",
      "\"When a manager is sacked at any level - and obviously I'm a part-owner in a football club - it's a poor reflection on everybody; it means it's not worked, it means the decision-making all the way through has not been successful, it means the manager has not won enough football matches and that ultimately everybody loses,” Neville said.",
      "\"Particularly when you're sacking a manager part-way through a season it's difficult to get an adequate replacement in.",
      "\"Manchester United have been here before. They're in a challenging position again. I am surprised it's happened this morning; I'm not surprised it's happened.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. I think the last week or so, some of the press conferences that we've seen, it only ends one way. But I did think that they would get through another couple of weeks, try and work out what to do.",
      "\"But obviously it's become that challenging internally that they've decided to do it, which was a shock this morning at 10 o'clock when I heard the news.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has sent a heartfelt message to Ruben Amorim after the head coach was sacked by Manchester United. The Reds' captain took to Instagram to share a photograph of the two embracing during a training session.",
      "Alongside the snap, Fernandes wrote: \"Thank you Mister! I wish the best for you and your technical staff.\"",
      "It shows just how close a bond the 31-year-old star man forged with Amorim and his coaching staff, under whom Fernandes has managed to shine through thick and thin. The Portugal international has been one of United's most influential players both on and of the pitch since his arrival from Sporting CP in 2020.",
      "Not only the captain of the first-team under Amorim, Fernandes was also part of a six-man core leadership group alongside Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez, Noussair Mazraoui and Tom Heaton last year.",
      "Maguire also took to Instagram to wish Amorim well in the aftermath of his departure. On his account, the centre-back shared a picture of himself and Amorim shaking hands at the side-lines, captioned: \"Thank you for everything boss. I wish you all the best in the future.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Matthijs de Ligt also took to social media to wish Amorim well, hinting further the departing head coach was thought of fondly by his squad. He wrote: \"Thank you for everything boss, good luck for the future.\"",
      "The news of Amorim's departure from Old Trafford emerged on Monday morning, when United shared an official statement on their decision. It read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it's the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Oliver Glasner is thought to be the leading contender to succeed Amorim, at present, as the United board scour the market for suitable candidates. The Austrian is out of contract with Crystal Palace this summer, and would be able to make the move then without the need for the Reds to pay the Eagles compensation.",
      "It's also claimed that Glasner is keen on the vacancy, and he could be willing to make the move when his current deal expires. Elsewhere, a wealth of names from around the world have been linked with taking up tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "Xavi, Zinedine Zidane, Andoni Iraola and Enzo Maresca have all seen their names mentioned, as have the likes of Gareth Southgate, Laurent Blanc, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the Premier League giants opt to appoint a permanent head coach in the coming days, or they will instead opt for an interim manager until the end of the season.",

      "Manchester United insist Ruben Amorim was sacked due to a lack of progress on the pitch and have denied there was a power struggle going on at Old Trafford, despite Amorim bringing those tensions into the open over the last week.",
      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, less than 19 hours after a remarkable press conference at Elland Road in which he demanded more power and told director of football Jason Wilcox to \"do his job\". Tensions between Amorim and members of the football leadership team, including Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, have become public in recent weeks and Amorim laid them bare at Elland Road.",
      "His stunning remarks left nobody in any doubt that were issues behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Amorim's job came under immediate scrutiny and after what was essentially a 'back me or sack me' plea, his 63-game reign was brought to an end on Monday.",
      "But United sources insist that the decision was made solely on results and denied there had been any power struggles or that Amorim had laid down an ultimatum demanding more power. They insist the 40-year-old maintained the 'unwavering support' of everyone within the club but there hadn't been enough progress for him to continue in the role.",
      "Amorim had been frustrated at being told there was no money to spend in January and was keen to add a midfielder to his squad, with United initially showing interest in attacker Antoine Semenyo before tightening the purse strings.",
      "The decision was made to sign three attacking players last summer, in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, as well as goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and United insist Amorim was on board with that recruitment plan and happy with the decision to strengthen the attack over the midfield.",
      "In his press conference after the Leeds draw, Amorim had demanded to be the manager at United rather than the coach, even though his job title since his appointment in November 2024 was head coach. United have no plans to change that structure and their next appointment is likely to have to accept the same job title.",
      "United sources point out that the £250million spent since Amorim's arrival made the club one of the highest spenders in the Premier League in that time. Although the team have shown signs of improvement this season and sit sixth in the Premier League, the decision has been made to axe Amorim to give the squad a better chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season.",

The MEN also understand that United are comfortable with Fletcher in charge of first-team affairs for more than just one game as they weigh up their options over a permanent successor to Amorim.",

The Italian head coach thrived at Stamford Bridge, securing a Europa Conference League title and the Club World Cup, but may be reluctant to thrust himself back into such a demanding job so soon.",
      "Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola has also been linked with the job, but it is unknown as to whether the Cherries boss will see his head turned by the prospect of switching to a Premier League rival, given his loyalty on the south coast.",

Former midfielder Fletcher will officially take charge of United's Premier League trip to Burnley on Wednesday night and is expected to remain in the dugout for the FA Cup tie with Brighton on Sunday.",
      "The 41-year-old oversaw a smaller training session, mostly comprising academy players, on Monday morning, with those involved in the match against Leeds on Sunday going through a recovery session. Fletcher will take his first proper session on Tuesday before holding a press conference to preview the trip to Turf Moor. Although he has no senior management experience, he was part of Erik ten Hag's first-team staff and made 342 appearances for the club as a player.",
      "United sources contrasted that level of experience with Chelsea's caretaker boss, Calum McFarlane, who stepped up from academy football in the wake of Enzo Maresca's sacking.",
      "That is why there is faith in Fletcher to guide the club through a tricky period as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox consider their options. Although a permanent appointment could be made now, there is a feeling that it might make sense to wait until the end of the season, when the field of candidates could be greater. That could lead to a caretaker being appointed until the end of the season.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola are both out of contract in the summer, with Glasner particularly keen on the Old Trafford role, although his 3-4-3 system at Selhurst Park could be a sticking point.",

      "\"One of our targets was to bring in a player with pace and deep runs,\" Glasner said. \"We didn't manage to do that, despite talking about it for months.\"",

      "The pair's relationship ultimately broke down and, despite guiding Wolfsburg to the Champions League, Glasner departed for Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Likewise, at Crystal Palace, Glasner has been unafraid to kick up a fuss. Their FA Cup-winning manager has repeatedly expressed his frustration at the Eagles' failure to invest adequately in preparation for European competition.",
      "\"I would have wished for a little bit more backing, yes,\" said Glasner back in November. \"I think in January we just correct what we failed to do in the summer. By January, we have played 60/65 per cent of the season. Let's see.\"",
      "The Palace boss is also said to have threatened to walk away from Selhurst Park if they sold defender Marc Guehi on transfer deadline day this summer.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",

      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "This time 12 months ago, Sean Dyche was sacked as Everton boss with David Moyes returning to the club.",
      "The task for Moyes was straightforward enough: Ensure Everton were a Premier League club when they move into their shiny new stadium. A year later and Moyes has achieved that goal with Everton 12th in the Premier League and a feel-good factor around the Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "Now, two more managers have got new January jobs but identifying a clearly achievable goal for either is a far harder task than with Moyes at Everton.",
      "Liam Rosenior has been given a laughable six-and-a-half-year deal at Chelsea having swapped desks in the BlueCo organisation while Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins at Manchester United, albeit it on a temporary basis.",
      "Keeping the seat warm for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is some mission.",
      "Those two jobs are some of the most coveted in England and the world, but which is more appealing? Here’s a look at what Rosenior and the new United boss faces.",
      "",
      "Let’s start with Chelsea.",
      "The Stamford Bridge club are owned by BlueCo, a primarily US-based consortium that was founded in 2022 to purchase Chelsea after Roman Abramovich was forced to sell. They are a multi-club group ownership having also purchased Strasbourg in 2023.",
      "The chairman, and most public figure, is Todd Boehly while Behdad Eghbali is among the directors. While Boehly is often the man blamed for Chelsea’s latest mess, Eghbali is the one calling the shots and reportedly the man who was in constant disagreement with Enzo Maresca.",
      "The MO of BlueCo has always been to buy some of the best young players in the world and then give them long contracts to amortise the costs and comply with PSR. Since BlueCo took over in 2022, no Premier League club has spent more money with around £1.49bn spent.",
      "Given BlueCo only took over in 2022, the ultimate end goal of that project has yet to become clear. Are they looking to sell these players on for profit? Or do they believe they can win Premier League titles in three or four years’ time?",
      "At Manchester United, things are not too dissimilar. In February 2024, Jim Ratcliffe’s INEOS spent £1.3bn to take 29% of the club away from the Glazer family. While the Glazers continue to sit back and watch the dollars flow into their bank account, Ratcliffe has taken over football operations.",
      "He appointed Omar Berrada as CEO, who previously worked for Manchester City owners the City Football Group while Jason Wilcox is director of football.",
      "It is with Wilcox that Ruben Amorim reportedly had mounting disagreements, particularly when it came to transfers and the team’s tactical set-up.",
      "While United’s hierarchy is perhaps not as dictatorial as Chelsea’s, it is expected that any new manager will have to appease Wilcox and Berrada if they are to stay in the job. United’s board also appear to cut their manager a bit more slack. Maresca left after saying he endured the worst ‘48 hours’ of his Chelsea career while Amorim was allowed a 15th-place finish, embarrassing cup exit to Grimsby and describing the team as the worst in the club’s history.",
      "",
      "Squad-wise, Chelsea are marginally better – look at the league table – but there are problems to be fixed for both sides.",
      "United’s is currently a mix of good but ageing players and young talents still lacking experience. Senne Lammens has shored up the long-troubled area of goalkeeper but the use of Ayden Heaven in recent weeks has highlighted how injury-prone United’s main central defenders can be.",
      "In midfield, both Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are not getting any younger and Amorim’s insistence on strengthening this area is what reportedly cost him his job. A new manager may have a higher opinion of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Up front, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have brought much-needed freshness but Joshua Zirkzee and Benjamin Sesko remain unconvincing.",
      "For Chelsea, they play exactly like what they are – a young squad full of potential but lacking the experience to be consistent.",
      "Moises Caicedo is one of the best midfielders in the league along with Enzo Fernandez, while Estevao looks like a star in the making. Cole Palmer is a former Player of the Year but struggled in 2025 and they have a lot of good if not great options up front in Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "At the back, it is very youth-focused with Tosin Adarabioyo being the oldest member at 28.",
      "All of that is to say that Chelsea’s squad have a lot of potential; it is just about how a new manager can get the best out of that and whether a more seasoned veteran is needed for others to flourish.",
      "MORE ON CHELSEA AND UNITED ON F365\n* Liam Rosenior is BlueCo’s Chelsea yes man, even if he absolutely insists he isn’t\n* Steve Bruce return request is why ex-Man Utd players are helping to keep the club trapped in purgatory\n* Man Utd ‘in favour of a new sporting director’ as Wilcox future becomes unclear after Amorim sack",
      "",
      "When it comes to history, there is no debate. Manchester United are one of the most successful teams in the history of football with the trophy room to show for it.",
      "Chelsea did win trophies before Abramovich’s takeover but they had only been league champions once before the Russian came in. The vast majority of their trophies, especially the more prestigious ones, have come this century.",
      "In more recent years, Chelsea have become the more successful club with two Champions League wins since United last won the trophy and the same number of league titles. A Club World Cup and Conference League trophy completed the set for the London side and there is a reasonable debate to be had that Chelsea have been the most consistently successful English club of the 21st century.",
      "But the lure of United, along with its millions of fans, is the possibility of being the first league-winning manager since Ferguson.",
      "Football managers have often got themselves into this position by having an unshakeable self-belief and so, even if there is plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise, they will believe they can be the one that ‘fixes’ United.",
      "Chelsea may be stronger on paper both in terms of squad and recent success, but it is that aspect that may sway a potential manager over to United.",
      "",
      "If you ask either club what their expectations are, the stock answer is ‘win the league’ because neither can be seen to be aiming for anything less. But in reality, a few spots below the top place would enable a manager to stay in post.",
      "Of the two, the bar would appear to be higher at Chelsea. They have qualified for the Champions League in five of the last seven seasons and so simply finishing top four is perhaps not good enough. For Liam Rosenior arriving in mid-season, ensuring that is a must for this campaign but that expectation will be raised next year.",
      "For a United manager, Champions League qualification, and the money that comes with it, would be a seen as success having done so just once in the past four years. Fletcher or Solskjaer stand a good chance of doing that with the club three points off Liverpool.",
      "How they go about that also comes with expectations. Chelsea have a mode of business that relies on a manager getting the best out of young players and so Rosenior will have to accept that. The good news is that they are willing to get their chequebook out, albeit not for established world stars.",
      "For United, it remains to be seen how much influence Wilcox and Berrada will seek to have post-Amorim with the Portuguese mostly given carte blanche. Until he didn’t. Transfer-wise, it seems to be a case of you will get what you’re given for both clubs.",
      "",
      "By almost all the metrics, Chelsea should be the more appealing of the two choices but the prospect of etching yourself into United history is what the club has been trying to sell for years.",
      "Chelsea have gone with Rosenior but do not discount United being able to tempt another big name to Old Trafford.",

Insiders claim De Zerbi feels ready for a major challenge and is particularly drawn to the prospect of another stint in English football, where his attacking philosophy earned widespread acclaim.",
      "Manchester United‘s current approach plays perfectly into this scenario. Following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim after just 14 months in charge, the club has opted for an interim solution for the remainder of the season, delaying a permanent appointment until the summer. This timeline suits De Zerbi’s situation at Marseille, where he remains under contract until 2027, but would be open to discussions if a prestigious opportunity arises.",
      "However, they do face some competition as sources have stated that Tottenham have De Zerbi down as a candidate to replace Thomas Frank. The Danish manager will be assessed at the end of the season, and if they do not feel enough progress is made, Spurs could also be in the market for a new manager. The Italian is amongst the thoughts of those at the club.",

And while he too favours a three-man defensive line, he has shown more tactical flexibility and is not adverse to reverting to a 4-3-3 system, which many feels suits the players within the Old Trafford squad.",
      "While other names have emerged as contenders, De Zerbi’s prior Premier League success and existing backing inside the club position him prominently on the shortlist.",

      "But enough of Amorim. He, like so many other poor hapless souls, is now part of Manchester United’s past. Who is their future? Who is the next manager for the impossible job? The one who this time will definitely be the man to return them to the promised land and then not in fact do that?",

If Amorim is considering applying for a position at Morrisons, I’m not sure he’s ready to take that step up quite yet. After all Morissons is a fairly well run company with competent senior management. Amorim’s lack of experience dealing with competent senior management in the UK could count against him.",

There’s no way he could go straight from the Manchester United Clown Festival to working for a serious organisation like Morrisons. The senior management talent gap between Man U and Morrisons would be too big for him to negotiate at this stage in his career.\nBen Teacher",
      "",
      "It seems to me that there are two very clear truths in this latest chapter of the United show.",
      "Firstly, that the in-job performance of Ruben Amorim – over the entirety of his red devil reign – is irredeemably and unforgivably abysmal, and he should have been sacked because of that. In almost fifty league matches, he only won three times by more than one goal. He leaves with a negative six goal difference. That is hilariously bad, and should have seen any manager in world football – much less one at a ‘big club’ – looking for new work.",
      "Secondly, he’s clearly been fired not because of the above, but because he offended one or more snowflakes in the United hierarchy. And that’s the worst bit for me. We were told, after being at the whim of the Glazers’ utter disregard for football for a decade, that INEOS were serious people, who’d bring in best-in-class professionals. But the way this has transpired screams to me of insecure men who’ve been promoted above their ability and can’t take the finger being pointed back at them.",
      "Very few managers last even as long as he did. United as a club desperately need to get away from the ‘saviour-manager’ and just get a good coach in, who can make the most of what is available. There is not another Fergie out there. But that doesn’t mean that this team, and this squad, shouldn’t be playing much better and delivering much better results than it is.",

      "Man U are at least 2 managers away from anything close to their former glories, and have been since Ferguson left. It won’t happen for many obvious reasons, but they need 3+ seasons of something more like a Brentford/Brighton/Bournemouth style model to lay some stability and foundations for a proper rebuild before they start chasing elite managers/players. Had Amorim been a bit less wedded to his system, he might well have fit the bill here. They need to do it soon too, before they are forced to by those noodle and tractor partners finally removing their sponsorship deals.",
      "Ian H makes a good point regarding bulletproof and overly controlling hierarchies too, which brings me to my last point – I’ve heard Unai Emery’s name touted a lot today. Why would he leave a club that he has purring largely because he has Fergie-like levels of control, for 2026 Man U where he will have very little and an inferior squad?",
      "Sporting directors are a great idea in theory, but there’s a finite supply of managers period, let alone enough who are willing to cede that much control, fit whatever the chosen playing style is, AND bring success. Emery is living proof that something closer to the old ways can still work.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "With the sacking of Amorim all attention is now focused on who is likely to be the next Man United manager. Several names have emerged including Xabi, De Zerbi and Glasner.",

At this stage of the game, I can say with maximum confidence that nobody knows English football better than the man himself, that’s Southgate. He has acquired and exhibited thorough knowledge and understanding of the EPL, clearly manifest in his roles as player, club Manager and National team Manager.",
      "The point must further be made that Southgate has demonstrated flexibility, willingness and ability to make changes and deliver effective tactics, evident in taking England to the finals of the Euro competition. A sine qua non for achieving success in football is the relationship between the Manager and the players. The Manager and players interrelationships, by and large, impact the performance of the team.",
      "Needless to say that Southgate continuously and unabatedly established good rapport with the players he managed.

He is the right man for the job.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",

      "If some papers had Chelsea moving for Eddie Howe at the weekend, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more noise about Utd moving for him as that makes more sense and would potentially be a decent fit.",
      "The time could be right in the summer for all parties to move on – Newcastle would like a manager to help them take the next step to the truly elite level, a lot of the squad are ageing and running down contracts so a rebuild is coming – after last summer I’d prefer if it wasn’t Howe calling the shots on transfers and we’re yet to see what the relationship with the new DoF will be.",
      "I’d rather Howe left on his terms than be sacked given what he’s done for the club – he’ll always be a legend. I’d love to see him develop and change at Newcastle and prove the doubters (including me) wrong but football rarely rewards romanticism.",
      "As a Newcastle fan I think we are at a tipping point where Howe will have lived long enough to become the villain. The majority of fans are onside but there is a growing minority who are now sensing that tactically he’s peaked and he cannot escape the blame for such a lot of money (£100m+) spent on dross like Ramsey and Elanga. His focus on building an entire team of athletes/runners with no guile or flair becomes more obvious with time, but he could achieve a real bounce at Utd and get them back up the table.",
      "Howe’s approach would suit Utd’s fans and to a large degree could work with the players they have. Cunha, Mbuemo and Sesko were all wanted by Howe in the summer so he has already done his homework and won’t need a massive squad overhaul.",
      "Howe’s man-management style could work at United who I don’t think have had since Ole a manager who was really in tune with the players. If Bruno F is onside he’s an excellent player and Utd have the kind of sh*thouses Howe likes to have.",
      "Where it gets murkier is whether the Utd players are prepared to work as hard as Howe demands, and whether they have the legs/athleticism to play this ‘Intensity is our Identity’ way. Howe will also want the kind of control he’s gained at Newcastle on transfers, which seems to be where Amorim eventually crossed the line to be sacked, but he wouldn’t need the root and branch change Amorim wanted.",
      "I don’t think Howe will move mid-season. Despite a lot of quite poor performances Newcastle are well placed in all four competitions – can progress in the CL to the play-offs, home draw in the FA Cup, tough two legged tie with City in the Carabao but they are not invincible, and a few decent results will see them climb the table quickly.",
      "If it were summer or end of season I could see this happening. It might still if Utd find an interim like Fletcher or someone else until May and then chase Howe in the summer.\nJames, Leeds",
      "",
      "Let the deluge of memes and bile flow but at the heart of it, Amorim has played Sirs Jim, Wilcox and Berrada like three tarnished magnets on a tactics board. And to the tune of a massive payout no less. An absolute masterclass of an exit… possibly inspired by what transpired New Year’s Day in West London or what unrequited opportunity could now beckon in East London (one Portuguese legend for another), who knows.",
      "Anyhow if he hasn’t already, Ruben could enter storied Manchester folklore by Robin Hooding some of that sweet, sweet bunce back to the soup lady and SAF and all the poor folks Ratcliffe kicked to the curb in the name of efficiency and club virtue.\nEric, Los Angeles CA (Just how springy is a Darren Fletcher bounce ?)",
      "",
      "With so many teams struggling to string together a run of performances (like Villa’s recent surge shows), it’s clear that even 6th place, only 4 points above 15th, is pretty underwhelming, given the summer investment and all that extra time to train and prepare while not playing in Europe. It’s hard to empathize with Amorim, who said earlier this season that he was the coach. He also said not even the Pope could change his mind.",
      "But you do have to wonder how much ‘meddling’ into team selection and tactics was coming from the shadows of the ‘back room’ staff. Especially those that never have to front up to the cameras. Apparently, it’s pretty common for Directors of Football to speak publicly in many other major leagues.",
      "Regardless, it’s such a poor look on the sports guru that is Sir Jim. All his marginal gains, by cutting staff, staff lunches, etc., while squandering millions on managers and sporting directors. Results looking pretty bleak for a ‘Top 6’ club. Nothing marginal there.",
      "When checking whether the ’new manager bounce’ is a thing, one report indicated it works in about 75% of cases, with teams averaging 1.4 to 1.8 points more over the next 5 or 6 games. If true, perhaps teams should change managers every 6 games.",
      "But for firing Amorim in essentially the same week as Chelsea canning Maresca will create such a wonderful litmus test of how these two basket-case clubs fare over the rest of the season. Chelsea has form (under the old regime) for replacing managers and continuing to excel. Utd, not so much – possibly a proper new manager slump. Interesting days ahead.\nPaul McDevitt",
      "",
      "I was disappointed to see a major absence in the winners and losers column this week: Mainoo.",
      "Surely, if anyone is a winner from Amorim’s delightfully acrimonious departure it’s him (and maybe Amad if he can be released back to an attacking role again). You’d have to expect that it means he can finally get games without having to go to Italy or Turkey where everything will come with an asterisk.",
      "Second – and while I say this with a wink, you know I want it too – Rashford. We know Barca will not be able to find the money for him, in spite of him being loved by Flick and doing good work. So when he comes back, maybe it’s to a manager that actually knows how to use him. Would boil so much piss of course, which is a bonus.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "While I’m all for your clickbaity lists, ranking Erik Ten Hag fourth behind Solskjaer is interesting. I mean, everyone is entitled to their opinion and no one is denying that Ten Hag’s second season was awful and even the FA Cup fig leaf did not preserve any modesty, but factually – looking at win percentage – at 51.8% Ten Hag is only second to Mourinho and this includes results from his second season.",
      "A second season where due to injuries we started with 29 different back fours in 38 games in front of a new, error-prone goalkeeper. One might plausibly say that such intense disruption in defense in front of a goalkeeper who is new to the country, league and club prevented the goalkeeper from settling in and added to the nerves and confusion in an ever changing defence and the real question is with such chaos and negativity, how did he still manage to finish in the top half with 60 points (which incidentally is better than Amorim was on course to get with 31 points from 20 games)?",
      "Don’t get me wrong, Ten Hag wasn’t the perfect manager. I didn’t like his public criticism of Sancho, even if it was possibly merited. His reliance on certain players who weren’t performing was an issue and his scouting was mediocre.",
      "This said, during his second season the problems were massively overblown considering the injury crisis we faced and, where at other clubs leeway seems to be given for injuries, the circus surrounding Man Utd, the negativity, the constant will he/won’t he be sacked all took on a life of its own really and sucked the confidence out of the players.",
      "Ultimately, something needed to change and that change was the manager, but the idea that Solskjaer was a better manager than Ten Hag is absurd, especially when Ten Hag won two trophies compared to Solskjaer’s zero – the FA Cup Final being particularly impressive against league winners Man City.\nDaniel, Cambridge"

      "Amorim had a few quirks, but most coaches do.",
      "When United opened their doors for the first 15 minutes of training the day before European games, it was strange to see Amorim watch the sprints and rondos on a different pitch – sometimes 50 yards away, and far removed from his coaching staff.",
      "He was far more involved – whistle in hand – when the sessions began, though he wasn’t keen to let the media into those.",
      "And that’s a ‘quirk’? That he did not take part in the circus of the 15-minute open training sessions that are specifically designed to reveal absolutely nothing to the watching media? And then he ‘wasn’t keen’ to allow the media to watch actual training? Weirdo.",
      "There was a full open session in Malaysia on United’s post-season trip in May, but that whole expedition was not run on fully professional lines given the amount of downtime that was allowed.",
      "Once United arrived at their training base in Chicago in July, access was limited. The candour of Amorim’s media conferences was not matched by his openness with training.",
      "This is just plain odd. You cannot find fault with the quotes given by an eminently quotable and open man, so you criticise him for not letting you watch him work?! Does Stone like to write with somebody watching over his shoulder? Can we volunteer?",

      "Genuinely intrigued about how it is ‘peculiar’ to train footballers who play in the same position to move into the right areas of the pitch. Did Stone think that footballers just played five-a-side all day?",

      "The meeting between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox seems destined to go down in Man Utd infamy.",
      "Amorim is described by the various reports on his demise to have been ‘overly emotional’, ‘very negative’, ‘erratic’ and even ‘incensed’ at having his tactical approach questioned in the aftermath of the Wolves home draw, which appears to have been far more damaging than the stalemate at Leeds five days later.",
      "The changes in shape which delivered a thrilling attacking performance against Bournemouth and clear improvements in the win over Newcastle were cast aside when perhaps the worst team in Premier League history came to Old Trafford, and Amorim greeted Wolves with his patented three-at-the-back formation.",
      "The result was an insipid performance and humiliating draw which underlined the disconnect between club and coach. Rob Dawson of ESPN writes that it underlined ‘a growing feeling within the club that Amorim and his staff had come to fear the Premier League’.",
      "It led to confusion in the Man Utd hierarchy, which felt that Amorim needed to show more flexibility and a willingness to adapt.",
      "Having already grown frustrated with ‘the unwanted influence of Wilcox,’ according to Simon Stone of the BBC, Amorim ‘blew up’, to phrase a couple of reports, at the perceived criticism.",
      "Two accounts of the meeting do seem especially ghost-written by a Jason W. No, that’s too obvious. Let’s say J. Wilcox.",
      "Dawson says the director of football had simply ‘encouraged’ Amorim ‘to be more proactive’ and ‘delivered the message in a calm and measured way’.",
      "Richard Jolly of the Independent writes that Wilcox was ‘not just expressing his own thoughts but those of others in the structure,’ and that ‘what Amorim probably did not realise, however, was that Wilcox was the last defending him, the last arguing he should be granted more time’ and ‘could not have done more for him’.",
      "The final call to sack Amorim was made by Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada with the full support of the rest of the Manchester United decision-making structure. The line is that the coach’s failure to carry out his promise to develop and evolve the team away from his own preferred philosophy after over a year in charge was ultimately his undoing, rather than any breakdown in relationships with higher-ups.",

      "In a wide-ranging Athletic article, Laurie Whitwell, Adam Crafton and Mark Critchley write that when Wilcox told Amorim the players ‘had become confused over his vision’, the coach simply ‘responded that the players needed to be changed’.",
      "Wilcox’s reply was diplomatic, hoping to ‘work through the issues’, but Amorim ‘reacted by saying he wished to leave the club and would be calling his agent’.",
      "He had his wish a few days later.",

      "Richard Keys absolutely nailed it.",
      "Wilcox told the players in a meeting held after Amorim’s sacking that “we don’t understand where the last 48 hours have come from,” and how he had also “sensed some situations where they were not on the same wavelength as Amorim”.",

      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles, the criticism, everything, we need to change the club,” Amorim said in his final public comments as Man Utd head coach.",
      "It seemed like a strange comment at the time, out of place in an already notably abrasive missive. Yet as with much of what Amorim said, it was heavily influenced by his feelings behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim had grown to feel ‘the pressure to change his system’ from Wilcox and those above him was building because of ‘continued criticism from former players in the media, including Gary Neville and Paul Scholes,’ according to ESPN’s Dawson.",
      "The three Athletic writers suggest Amorim’s comment might have been ‘a reference to the possibility that Ratcliffe watches Neville’s podcast, in which he has questioned Amorim’s tactics’.",
      "But Jamie Jackson of The Guardian says nothing will change, even with Amorim’s frustration at the set-up: ‘Whoever does take over will have to work within the structure that gives Wilcox and Berrada a higher status regarding football policy than the head coach.’",
      "Neville has, of course, since had his say.",
      "",
      "No-one should be willing to lose their job over Emiliano Martinez but there might never have been a man more willing to die on unnecessarily awkward hills than Amorim.",
      "While far from the biggest issue causing his ultimate downfall, transfers certainly contributed. Some situations are specifically cited, such as Amorim’s treatment of the bomb squad and how Alejandro Garnacho’s value was deemed to have been reduced by £15m as a direct result of how he was ostracised around the time of the Europa League final.",
      "Another bone of contention was how Amorim had a £72m striker in Benjamin Sesko foist upon him despite his desire for a proven Premier League commodity in Ollie Watkins.",
      "But the decision to sign Senne Lammens over Martinez was the bigger sticking point.",
      "That was where the Man Utd hierarchy ‘drew a line’ and ‘refused to sanction’ the transfer (Stone, BBC), which would have cost far more in a fee and wages for a much older player.",
      "But it was that experience and personality in particular which Amorim felt his squad lacked.",
      "It is said by ESPN’s Dawson that Amorim’s praise of Matheus Cunha in October – “we need leaders, but sometimes what I am thinking is we need some crazy guys” – was actually ‘viewed internally as a dig at the board for passing on Martinez’.",
      "Things came to a head in January when Amorim pushed for Antoine Semenyo, a summer target with a £65m release clause which is active through the start of the winter window.",
      "While the Bournemouth forward was disappointed with elements of Manchester United’s approach in the summer, when they eventually favoured a move for Bryan Mbeumo instead, Semenyo was willing to talk with Amorim again and did so over the phone.",
      "It was then when Semenyo sought assurances over his role but also the future composition of the team itself, having been ‘concerned’ he would be used at wing-back.",
      "Paul Hirst of The Times details how Amorim told Semenyo ‘he was a flexible manager’ during that call, and that he would be moving away from any variation of his favoured 3-4-3 formation soon.",
      "James Ducker and Sam Wallace of the Daily Telegraph corroborate that, saying Amorim told Semenyo he would be used ‘as a left-winger in a dynamic 4-3-3’. Yet days later Man Utd had reverted to type in that Wolves game, perhaps signalling to Amorim’s employers that his show of tactical flexibility and evolution was neither lasting nor worth investing more money in.",
      "",
      "As one Telegraph source said: “You can write down 100 things he said in press conferences where you’re thinking, ‘F**king hell Ruben, what are you doing? Why are you saying that?”",
      "Amorim himself appears to have accepted how many of his painfully honest public comments worked against him in the end, including his decision to question the development of three academy graduates the club had loaned out, later questioning “the feeling of entitlement” he felt had become a problem “for the kids” at the club.",
      "Those quotes and his personal barbs even at senior players, like Benjamin Sesko or the “anxiety”-ridden Patrick Dorgu, went down abysmally, much like his handling of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "In Amorim’s defence, Dawson says the Portuguese continued with his approach ‘in the hope it would elicit a positive response’ from a group he deemed “broken”, “fragile” and in need of some home truths.",
      "But there were moments he clearly crossed the line, Roy Keane MUTV rant-style, as Dawson documents:",
      "‘In another television interview last season, Amorim was so outspoken about a player that the club felt it was better to ask the broadcaster to remove the comments before they were aired. The broadcaster agreed.’",
      "It all spawned one of the great manager nicknames, delivered by ‘one player representative’ according to Hirst of The Times after Amorim declared them “the worst team in the history of Manchester United”.",
      "Farewell, “Ruben Interim”. You will be missed.",
      "According to reports, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has indicated his ‘decision’ to INEOS as he is desperate to return to Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "Man Utd co-owners INEOS are looking to appoint a new sporting director after making the decision to sack Ruben Amorim on Monday, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville has been criticised by Craig Burley over his comments about Ruben Amorim’s potential successor.",
      "Ruben Amorim has irked one BBC journalist by not letting him watch him work, while a ‘peculiar’ training tactic is revealed.",
      "Robin Roefs has been the goalkeeper of the season in the Premier League, with Bart Verbruggen not too far behind."

      "Adeyemi has long been touted for a Premier League move, having made a name for himself as one of the best attackers in the German Bundesliga. The 23-year-old is versatile and can shine as a winger, second striker or centre-forward, which has seen elite Premier League clubs including Arsenal, Man Utd, Liverpool and Chelsea converge on him.",

Adeyemi could also fill in at No 9 or on the right if required.",

      "On Monday, news channels across the globe led with the ongoing story of FIFA Peace Prize winner Donald Trump’s operation to kidnap the leader of a sovereign country and put him on trial. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim was being sacked as Manchester United manager.",
      "Even almost 13 years since their last league title, United remain the biggest club in the country, up there with the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in terms of global attention. Add up the column inches, TV segments and YouTube videos this past decade and the club demanding more attention than anyone else is Manchester United.",
      "They are the sun in which a lot of English football orbits, which is why it can be so hard to get a decision right.",
      "This is not a defence of the Glazers or Ratcliffe for hiring a manager head coach wedded to a back three and then being shocked he does not deviate from it; that is a stupid decision regardless of which club you are running. But any time so much as a tap at an Old Trafford toilet gets changed, a familiar pattern occurs.",
      "And just recently, former midfielders Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt launched their own podcast alongside United-supporting TV host Paddy McGuinness.",
      "And that podcast is where Butt made one of the more ludicrous suggestions as to who should be in the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "“Darren [Fletcher] with either Michael [Carrick] and [Steve] Bruce, and if Michael wouldn’t do it, then Darren and Bruce until the end of the season.",
      "“Bruce has got unbelievable experience. Unbelievable. He is a great bloke, really. He knows the club.",
      "“He’s got no aspirations of going back into football for [himself] so he’s not gonna go, ‘I’m in charge here, it’s my club’… He’s gonna help.”",
      "Surely that last sentence alone is enough for Bruce to be ruled out? But if we put that to one side and say the 65-year-old can be tempted with the job he always wanted, what on earth qualifies him for it?",
      "Bruce’s last gig was with League One Blackpool, where he picked up 1.39 points per game, a tally only slightly better than his last Premier League job at Newcastle, where he registered 1.15 points per game. Perhaps the only thing that qualifies him for the job is he knows how to get United winning – he has managed against them 27 times and lost 21 times.",
      "MORE ON THE AMORIM DEPARTURE ON F365",
      "* Neville names Tuchel as one of three potential Man Utd managers he ‘likes’\n* Amorim issued ‘sack’ ultimatum to INEOS as Man Utd to make January signing on one condition\n* ‘Only way’ Man Utd appoint Thomas Tuchel as Amorim replacement revealed",
      "That Newcastle stint ended in 2021 and as scary as it may all be for us to accept the movement of time, that was five years ago.",
      "Butt’s claim is that Bruce ‘knows the club’, but which club does he know? Bruce played for United from 1987 to 1996. Only five of United’s players were even born then.",
      "Butt is not alone in his suggestion. Ferdinand wanted, nay expected, himself to be Fletcher’s second call behind 13-time Premier League winner Ferguson. Keane has been suggested as someone who can get the good ship United sailing in the right direction once again.",
      "The mad ideas are not unique to United but the sheer number of them is. Enzo Maresca, a manager who achieved more than Amorim and whose club is above United, also left his job and yet someone like Hernan Crespo was not telling the Chelsea board to get Michael Ballack in because he ‘knows the club’. The closest example was the inevitable linking of Frank Lampard to the job, but that suggestion at least comes with the caveat that he is currently managing the side at the top of the Championship.",
      "With United, there is a burning desire to return to the glory years of the club. Perhaps it is the cold turkey approach of going from consistent title challengers to struggling to make the top four that has left such a yearning. The pundits we see on our screens, hear on podcasts and read in articles are from the ‘90s and ‘00s because frankly, who is there from more recently?",
      "When a TV company is deciding which pundit has more credibility and will attract more viewers, title winners are going to have more sway than a player who was at United when they finished sixth in 2019. It’s also why Paul Merson, Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Thierry Henry are the only Arsenal pundits you ever seem to see.",
      "The problem is that it creates an unrealistic standard that will never be reached and an environment where every decision is analysed under the microscope. Go and look at pictures of Amorim when he first arrived compared to when he left and it’s a similar vibe to Barack Obama’s first day as President compared to his last.",
      "The Portuguese boss was astonished in his very first week just how many interviews he had to do but that is because everyone wants a slice of the Manchester United pie. It is a club always in the news even as the 15th-best team in the league last year.",
      "The comparison of Ferguson and his long wait for a trophy is not a new one but is worth keeping in mind. Could the Scotsman have survived if every day there was a former player questioning his position? When Ferguson dropped David Beckham, could he have dealt with the resulting backlash in a social media world? Back then, Ferguson simply had to avoid reading the newspapers and go about his day.",
      "Football has changed so much in the 13 years since Ferguson walked away and harking back to that United is pining after something that is just not possible anymore.",
      "Ratcliffe and INEOS have made some questionable and at times just morally wrong decisions since taking over football operations but when every decision they make feels like the biggest decision in the world, no wonder they make some errors.",
      "Fletcher, Xavi, Zidane, whoever’s next, it won’t change. Manchester United sells more than any other club in the world and while that remains the case, expect to continue to see anyone who ever even looked at a red shirt tell the club who they should be appointing and why that will finally bring them back to the good old days.",

      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header. A less impressive clean sheet came against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest and Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Spurs and Vicario have at least tightened up since then.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 13 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",

      "Man Utd legend Nicky Butt insists he would “give his season tickets back” if the Red Devils hired former Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca.",
      "The Red Devils announced on Monday that they had sacked Amorim after their 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday.",
      "There were a number of reasons for his dismissal with journalist Ben Jacobs revealing that there was ‘tension over a lack of alignment in the market and a breakdown between Amorim and Jason Wilcox.’",
      "Man Utd believed that ‘there haven’t been enough signs of evolution or progress’ and Jacobs added that the club insisted no head coach will ‘be given a recruitment veto like Erik ten Hag, as Manchester United’s model is collaborative’.",
      "There have already been a number of managers linked with the vacant Man Utd job with Darren Fletcher taking over for one or two games while the Red Devils attempt to appoint an interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "Man Utd would then appoint a permanent manager in the summer with former Chelsea boss Maresca, Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, Germany’s Julian Nagelsmann and Ipswich Town’s Kieran McKenna all linked.",
      "READ: Big Midweek: Arsenal v Liverpool, Nuno sack, Man Utd, Cole Palmer, Saudi Madrid derby",
      "However, Butt has urged Man Utd not to appoint Maresca, who was sacked by Chelsea last month, as he would be another ex-Man City person joining the club.",
      "Butt said: “If Maresca comes in – I like him as a coach, I really do – with the background, I would give my season tickets back.”",
      "But Man Utd legend Scholes replied: “I think going to Chelsea he would last two minutes. He has done alright.”",
      "Explaining himself, Butt added: “You mis-read me. I can’t sit here and go on about Man united philosophy and DNA and then go, ‘Well I’d love Maresca, an ex-Man City guy.’ Then you have Omar Berrarda and Jason Wilcox.",
      "“I don’t care how much success is. You’re forgetting where I’m from. Everyone is a City fan. I’m a Man United fan and I can’t accept that.”",
      "Gary Neville also talked about the DNA of the club when reacting to Amorim’s departure and the Man Utd legend has told the Red Devils that the “experiments have got to stop”.",
      "“It’s a difficult system, wing backs is challenging. The positions behind the centre forward are difficult positions. There are quite specialists positions in the system.",
      "“But that’s a failing upon the manager, the players and the club, in terms of not recruiting properly for it.",
      "“The experiments have got to stop. There is a very good video online that Bobby Charlton talks about what Man United is as a football club. Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd. Man United must take risks and play attacking football.",
      "“Man United have got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their club. Ajax would never change for anybody, Barcelona would never change for anybody.”",
      "The attention paid to Manchester United is almost unique on a global scale but so many opinions mean it is hard to move forward.",
      "Enzo Maresca has joined the long list of short-lived Chelsea managers, and the identity of the favourite to replace him is very obvious.",
      "Former Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca could be set for an immediate return to Premier League management at Man Utd, according to reports.",
      "Pundit Alan Shearer has hit out at “bonkers” Chelsea after they parted company with Enzo Maresca, while he has sent a warning to Liam Rosenior.",

      "It’s funny how both of those clubs ended up a financial clusterf***, isn’t it? A real puzzle.",
      "The QPR manager at the time was, of course, Harry Redknapp. Having only weeks earlier explained how “you shouldn’t be paying massive wages when you’ve got a stadium that holds 18,000 people,” a pay packet of £100,000 a week was sanctioned for Samba, who the boss called “a monster” and “proper centre-half” who would shore the club’s defence up and move them away from relegation trouble.",
      "Samba played 10 matches in which QPR conceded 19 times, failed to keep a clean sheet after his debut and told supporters to “get over” how much he was paid after conceding a penalty and being at fault for another goal in a 3-2 defeat to Fulham.",
      "QPR were relegated soon after and the Arsenal transfer legend was on his way.",

      "He would start one league game between his arrival and Fulham’s relegation in May, playing 151 minutes in total.",
      "By August, Mitroglou had gone back on loan to Olympiacos and the next month scored the winner against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. The following night, Fulham lost 5-3 away at Nottingham Forest to a Britt Assombalonga hat-trick to leave them bottom of the Championship.",

      "No list of shonky transfer decision-making is complete without some pre-Emery Aston Villa. They form the January transfer idiocy trifecta with QPR and West Ham.",

      "“He is an experienced player. He is a proper link between the midfield and the strikers,” manager Gerard Houllier said. “He has played in the Champions League. He’ll be a good asset for the future.”",
      "Makoun looked sloppy on his debut, got a straight red card for a dreadful tackle a fortnight later and played only five times in the league before the end of the season. He never played for Villa again, and yet only left on a permanent deal in July 2013.",
      "",
      "Ah Afonso, the striker now doomed forever to be held up as the example of why you should beware when buying strikers from the Eredivisie.",
      "As with Samba, the Brazilian would have threatened the top three but for a significant and inexplicable recouping of transfer outlay. In this instance, Middlesbrough somehow persuaded Qatar’s Al-Sadd to part with £7m for him.",

      "His 13 goals in 49 games included a hat-trick in that absurd 8-1 win over Manchester City, a penalty, and an FA Cup brace at home to Barrow. Boro were relegated – and Alves left – at the end of his only full season at the Riverside, with the Brazilian perhaps forever destined to be seen as the worst signing in the club’s history.",

      "While only one of these qualifies as the worst January signing in their club’s history, the fact both are so inextricably and inexplicably tied makes it easier for them to land a spot in the top ten.",
      "Torres, having already endured a general loss of form linked to an increasing list of physical issues built up over a career of playing ludicrously often since he was a teenager, was nevertheless identified by Chelsea as “one of the best players in the world with his peak years ahead of him” when they made what was then the fourth-biggest transfer in world football.",
      "For £50m they might well have expected 20 goals for the rest of the 2010/11 season. They received as many in the Premier League, but across his entire 172-game career for the Blues instead.",
      "His effect on Gary Neville and direct contribution to the three trophies he won at Stamford Bridge aside, it was a stunning failure Liverpool felt compelled to match.",
      "The majority of their £50m windfall was redirected to Newcastle for a player with 14 goals in 37 top-flight career games, who hoped to “fail” his medical.",
      "That he likely would have at any other point during an 18-month Liverpool career in which he scored 11 goals in 58 games will not be lost on the Anfield faithful. The Reds took a £20m hit when selling Carroll; to be fair, Torres left Chelsea as a 30-year-old free agent who by that point was still the most expensive player ever transferred between two Premier League clubs.",

      "The Golden Boot runner-up to Didier Drogba only a couple of seasons prior, McCarthy had also cracked double figures for goals in 2008/09. But after falling out of favour with a series of managers he sought solace at Upton Park, joining on the same day as Mido and Ilan.",
      "The South Africa legend did not score in his 14 appearances for West Ham before having his contract terminated by mutual consent in April 2011, a month before they slid into the Championship.",
      "",
      "There was little logic apparent in Southampton chucking a club-record £19.2m Monaco’s way for their fourth-choice forward in January 2018, beyond the forlorn hope that some residual Kylian Mbappe had rubbed off on Carrillo.",
      "It had not. Signed as a show of faith in manager Mauricio Pellegrino, Carrillo played eight times under the manager before his mid-March sacking. Replacement Mark Hughes curiously did not have quite the same level of belief in the Argentinean striker, who only played twice more in his first half-season.",
      "Nothing had changed by the summer and so Carrillo was loaned out to Leganes – the club Pellegrino took over after leaving the south coast. That loan was renewed a year later and by complete coincidence they were relegated from La Liga in 2020.",
      "Carrillo played his first game for Southampton on January 27, 2018 and his last on March 31 of the same year, failing to score and only eventually leaving permanently, on a free, two-and-a-half years later.",
      "",
      "It’s a pretty spectacular example of Newcastle-style long-term planning. In the summer of 2004, Boumsong was available on a free transfer and eventually joined Rangers. Four months later, Newcastle paid £8m to sign a central defender that nobody else was in for and who Newcastle themselves had shown no interest in signing on a free.",
      "Even if Boumsong had been decent, it would have been a cock-up.",
      "He wasn’t. In fact, the transfer was one of the deals raised by the Stevens Inquiry as being potentially suspect, with inconsistencies between the evidence given by manager Graeme Souness and Freddy Shepherd. The inquiry eventually decided that neither party, nor risible football agent Willie McKay, had a case to answer. Always a result when you manage to evade awkward questions because people are perfectly willing to accept you are just that incompetent.",
      "",
      "Swap deals and part-exchanges used to be all the rage in transfer gossip columns and speculatory circles but such spurious stories don’t tend to see the light of day anymore. A genuine theory: it’s because Alexis Sanchez and Henrikh Mkhitaryan ruined them for everyone by accidentally actually happening and highlighting why they never really actually had much before.",
      "It is difficult to quantify the sheer dreadfulness endured by literally every party involved in the transfer. Neither player enjoyed themselves in new surroundings. Neither club benefited. Both of the managers who sanctioned the deal were gone by the end of the year, Jose Mourinho pushed by Manchester United whereas Arsene Wenger jumped from Arsenal. The fans had almost nothing to celebrate beyond Sanchez’s piano-playing announcement video and Mkhitaryan’s assist-laden debut.",
      "Manchester United ran up an absurd wage bill for five goals in 45 games before discovering no-one fancied helping them shift that burden. Arsenal at least avoided that ignominy – Mkhitaryan was roughly OK and earned far less. But both players eventually left on free transfers for a reason, so cursed was this swap.",
      "",
      "Just a very sad story. Having sold Craig Bellamy to Manchester City for £14m, West Ham reinvested most of the proceeds in Savio, a German striker from Serie B side Brescia. Nsereko had scored three career league goals, all in the second tier.",
      "Savio played ten league games for West Ham but only ever started one match and never scored. Not only was his shooting awry, his physical presence was that of a dormouse. West Ham sold him to Fiorentina for just £3m less than seven months after signing him, taking a £1m loss per month on the initial outlay.",
      "From then on, Savio declined rapidly. He moved through lower-league clubs in Germany and Italy before moving through Kazakhstan, Bulgaria and Lithuania. There was also an arrest for faking his own kidnapping in Thailand, and reports of mental health issues along the way.",

      "Man Utd have begun talking to external candidates as they look for an interim manager to take charge of the team until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim's departure; Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have been contacted; Darren Fletcher has also been spoken to about the role",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 18:20, UK",
      "Manchester United have begun talking to external candidates as they look for an interim manager to take charge until the end of the season, with three former Old Trafford favourites in the mix for a possible return after Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "While the current focus is on finding an interim boss, the club haven't ruled out the possibility of making a substantive appointment, if they decide the right coach is available. For that, United are considering a much wider pool.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox is leading the process for United and following the initial, informal conversations with candidates, he is expected to conduct more formal interviews before making a recommendation in the coming days. Any final decision will be sanctioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "No timescales have been set, but it's thought the club's bosses would like to have someone in place before the Manchester derby on January 17. Fletcher is expected to be in charge for the next two matches, against Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday and Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday.",
      "Fletcher himself is a contender for the interim role, but United's hierarchy have viewed him as a promising option for the future, because of his lack of first-team coaching experience right now. Nevertheless, we've been told Fletcher has always been close with United's players, and the squad has been impressed by the early work he has done with them so far, with morale around the camp pretty high.",
      "Wilcox has already had conversations with former Old Trafford favourites Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solksjaer about the interim head coach position, with both seen as good possibilities to come into a club they know well. Both are currently out of work and available without the need to pay compensation.",
      "\"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be a huge story if he came back. He was sacked by Manchester United in November 2021. He's incredibly popular with the Manchester United faithful.",
      "\"He loved it and he gave a very emotional farewell when he left. There were no bridges burnt. The impression I'm getting is that Solskjaer is the favourite.",
      "\"Jason Wilcox, who is leading this search, has spoken to him. Solskjaer has made it clear he would like to return to Old Trafford.\"",
      "As talks continue for an interim boss, among those linked with the permanent role are Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner and Newcastle's Eddie Howe.",
      "\"I am Crystal Palace manager. It's wasted time for you to ask any more questions. I don't talk about any other club other than Crystal Palace,\" he said.",
      "Howe, meanwhile, also reiterated his commitment to Newcastle.",
      "\"I'm 100 per cent here, working as hard as I can, head down, ignoring all the stuff that you guys write, good or bad, because it's irrelevant,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about today's work and trying to prepare the team as well as we can for Leeds [on Wednesday], so that will never change from my perspective, my commitment to my work and my job.",
      "\"As long as I'm happy and able to express myself in the best way that I can to help the team, nothing will change.\"",
      "Asked if there was anything which could tempt him away from St James' Park, Howe replied: \"No, not at this current time.",
      "\"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships I have with the people around me. Now that's not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club.",
      "\"But, at the moment, I am very happy.\"",
      "Current interim boss Fletcher gave his first news conference on Tuesday ahead of the midweek trip to Burnley.",
      "After a busy 24 hours, the Manchester United U18s coach said: \"It's been surreal. It's an amazing honour to lead a Manchester United team. It wasn't in my wildest dreams that it was something that could potentially happen.",
      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I'm proud to do. It's not in the circumstances I expected it to happen so that doesn't sit easy with me.",
      "\"I've got a job to do which is to lead the team tomorrow. I have great honour and pride in doing that.\"",
      "Asked whether he had any conversations with Wilcox and Omar Berrada, Fletcher replied: \"I've had the conversations and the focus is on this game, then we'll speak after [Burnley].",
      "\"It all happened very quickly on Monday morning. Had a game to prepare and a very quick turnaround, a training session to organise, speak to the players so the focus has been on the Burnley match.",
      "\"It's important we give the Burnley match the respect and focus it needs to prepare the team in such a short space of time.\"",
      "Fletcher also has the strange circumstance of having his two sons - Tyler and Jack - training with the first-team squad. Midfielder Jack already made his first-team debut under Amorim.",
      "When asked if they could be handed full debuts, Fletcher started with a joke: \"I won't be disclosing team information before the game!\"",
      "He then added: \"They were in the training group on Monday because that was already arranged before I got there. They've been in the squad recently but we've got a couple of players back from injury, so we'll assess that tomorrow because of the short turnaround from games.",
      "\"They're in the periphery squad but whether they make the matchday squad, I don't know.\"",

      "Man Utd must appoint a manager who fits with their footballing DNA, according to Gary Neville, but would fit the bill? Between the Lines breaks down the side's stylistic profile under Sir Alex Ferguson and ranks the managers whose approaches are most similar",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 16:28, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names in the frame to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Fulham boss Marco Silva also make our top 10.",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 11th, his suitability score of 73.06 putting him just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
      "Pep Guardiola was a reported target for Manchester United before his appointment at Manchester City back in 2016 but interestingly, he sits bottom of our 32-man list, with a stylistic suitability score of just 50.77 out of 100.",
      "Some of the mooted candidates to take over from Amorim sit low in the list too, including Gareth Southgate, Kieran McKenna, Roberto De Zerbi and the Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, suggesting they are not great fits for the club's DNA.",

      "United are understood to have concluded that Amorim's position had become untenable.",

      "Amorim accepts that the results were not good enough and acknowledges that he had the worst win rate of any manager at United since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "But he also felt confident that he could achieve Champions League football this season if he remained in charge and that their form would improve with the return of players from Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "Amorim felt United needed one or two experienced signings this January transfer window, in particular an experienced Premier League striker.",
      "Whilst differences of opinion over transfer policy wasn't the ultimate deciding factor in his departure, it did play a part in the breakdown of relationships with his bosses.",

      "Amorim has told friends he struggled to cope with the noise from outside the club, which he feels undermined the job he was doing.",
      "Whilst he is adamant that the job wasn't too big for him, he was surprised by how political and difficult the role is at Manchester United, and feels it is an impossible job to prepare fully for, because no one understands the unique challenges until they are in place at Old Trafford.",

      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.\"",
      "That outburst followed cryptic suggestions to the media just before Christmas that he had not received the backing he anticipated in the transfer market.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen.\"",

      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 15:12, UK",
      "Liam Rosenior will watch his new team in action for the first time since being named Chelsea manager when they make the short trip to Craven Cottage to face his former club Fulham on Wednesday night. A watching brief, but there is little time to bed in.",
      "Chelsea have seven more matches to play in January even after this one, in four different competitions, with London derbies in both the domestic cups and a Champions League trip to Napoli thrown in. All while navigating the Premier League.",
      "It is called being thrown in at the deep end after stints at Hull and Strasbourg so perhaps taking the chance to watch this one from the stands is understandable, particularly after Chelsea picked up a memorable point away to Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "That last-gasp equaliser gives them a bit of momentum but Enzo Fernandez's scrappy finish was nothing compared to what Harris Reed treated the Cottage to earlier that afternoon. His even later leveller against Liverpool was a goal-of-the-season contender.",
      "Such drama is never too far away between these teams. In August, of course, Josh King had a goal controversially ruled out following an erroneous VAR check. How Fulham would love a measure of revenge by ruining Rosenior's return to take over their rivals.Adam Bate",
      "Ten games unbeaten. That is the run that Manchester City are on right now in all competitions; it is just that it does not feel quite so positive after their eight-game winning streak has ended with back-to-back draws, allowing Arsenal to pull clear again.",
      "The draw at the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland remain unbeaten this season, was one thing. Dropping two points in stoppage time at home to Chelsea was another. Pep Guardiola's side paid for their profligacy. It was sloppy. Not the mark of champions.",
      "But with Arsenal still to come to the Etihad Stadium in the spring, the onus is on City to regroup quickly and reduce the gap to three points ahead of the Gunners' game against Liverpool on Thursday. Beating Brighton at home - and preferably well - is now a must.",
      "While it felt like just a rare off night for Erling Haaland, it was perhaps a little concerning that the congested fixture list might be catching up with Rayan Cherki after his brilliant run of form. Maybe this is an opportunity for Guardiola to freshen things up in attack.",
      "Take liberties and Brighton can take advantage. After the ignominy of failing to beat West Ham twice in a month, they did win against Burnley last time out. Fabian Hurzeler's side came from behind to beat City in August. Do the double and it could be title race over.Adam Bate",
      "There is always a fascination with how teams perform after the exit of a divisive manager - sorry, Ruben, head coach - so there will be plenty of eyes on Turf Moor in one of the two later kick-offs on Wednesday evening where Manchester United return to action.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been appointed as United's interim boss, perhaps even interim to the interim boss. Will he take a minimalist approach to the role or overhaul the formation? Will he pick his son? Will he pick both sons? And will any of it actually work?",
      "In truth, Fletcher's options are limited given the list of absentees at United. He cannot even make the statement move of recalling Kobbie Mainoo with him out injured. But any kind of response to Amorim's departure - positive or negative - will bring intrigue.",
      "For Burnley, a club that now appears to be enduring rather than enjoying their Premier League return, this has to be regarded as an opportunity. Scott Parker did not like what he saw at Brighton last time out but United under the lights is a very different occasion.",
      "A record of two points from 11 games is the worst in the Premier League over that period. Burnley are still just about within touching distance of the teams above them but the turnaround will have to come quickly to save them. This would be a good time.Adam Bate",
      "Everton's mixed form at their new stadium continues after conceding four at home for the second time in four matches as they were beaten 4-2 by Brentford at the weekend. A repeat of anything like that against bottom club Wolves would spark serious scrutiny.",
      "David Moyes' side have actually picked up as many points away from the Hill Dickinson Stadium this season as they have inside it, their recent win at Nottingham Forest being their fourth of the season on the road. Doing it without Iliman Ndiaye was impressive.",
      "But if Everton are to bounce back then they will need others to step up, so amid the wreckage of that Brentford defeat it was encouraging that both misfiring strikers scored, while Jack Grealish bagged his first assists since August - against Wolves.",
      "That 3-2 win at Molineux feels an age ago now for the visitors, who are surely doomed for the drop. But Wolves boss Rob Edwards is entitled to feel a corner has been turned after a deserved point at Manchester United and that long-awaited win over West Ham.",
      "With teenage sensation Mateus Mane reenergising the Wolves supporters, it is Wolves who - improbably - come into this match with more momentum and certainly under less pressure. Back-to-back wins really would put Moyes' team under the spotlight.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace are navigating a difficult period at the moment, with Oliver Glasner currently on the worst run since he was appointed to the role in February 2024 after going seven games without a win.",
      "The Eagles have plummeted from fourth place in the Premier League on December 10, to 14th as things stand following the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle last time out.",
      "Facing a high-flying Aston Villa, who are level on points with Manchester City in second, should fill them with dread but Palace can take comfort and confidence from their recent encounters with Unai Emery's side.",
      "Unbeaten in their last six meetings with Villa across all competitions, Palace have been a constant thorn in the side of Emery and addressing their current rut with a win at Selhurst Park on Wednesday could add to this trend.",
      "On paper, it should be a routine win for Villa against a team low on confidence and form. But football isn't played on paper.",
      "The Eagles are due a win and Villa should be wary of a familiar foe getting the better of them again.Patrick Rowe",
      "After a promising start to life at Tottenham, one that had Spurs up in third after taking 17 points from the first nine games, Thomas Frank appears to have lost his way this season. Perhaps he will share some wine - and that sentiment - with Andoni Iraola.",
      "At least Iraola has credit in the bank and slightly lower expectations to deal with. Frank is facing more immediate discontent at Spurs, not least because of the style of play. The hope was that they were getting a details man, someone who would improve set pieces.",
      "Not only has the rest of the Premier League caught up with Frank in that regard this season, but his Tottenham team are not doing nearly enough in open play. In fact, they have not even scored a goal from open play in their last six games in all competitions.",
      "Newcastle will aim to win a third consecutive Premier League game for the first time this season when they host Leeds. Bruno Guimaraes is leading their resurgence.",
      "It is nothing new to see the 28-year-old inspiring the side, of course. But he has notably increased his attacking contribution this season. His goals in the wins over Crystal Palace and Burnley took him to seven in 19 Premier League games so far.",
      "He is their joint top scorer, alongside Nick Woltemade. With half of the campaign still to come, he has already matched his highest goal total in a full season for Newcastle.",
      "Guimaraes continues to play an invaluable role out of possession in Eddie Howe's midfield. But his increased attacking threat can be seen in his numbers for shots as well as goals. Guimaraes's averages this season have hit new highs.",
      "Newcastle's attack has been boosted by the return to fitness of Yoane Wissa, whose competition with Woltemade for the No 9 spot can only help. But if they find themselves in need of a goal against Leeds, their captain is the most likely candidate to step up.Nick Wright",
      "Igor Thiago's hat-trick against Everton on Sunday took him to 14 Premier League goals this season. He is the only player who even gets close to Erling Haaland in the scoring charts. Sunderland will be out to stop him at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The Black Cats know how ruthless he can be. Thiago scored with his only effort on goal at the Stadium of Light in August, when Sunderland had to come from behind to win 2-1. But they can approach the task with confidence after a string of fine defensive displays.",
      "Sunderland have only conceded twice in their last five games. They were breached from a set piece at Spurs on Sunday but before that game they shackled Haaland impressively, inspired by centre-back duo Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete.",
      "Mukiele and Alderete rank as two of the signings of the season and there are candidates elsewhere in the Sunderland team too. Granit Xhaka has had a transformative impact in midfield. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs has arguably been even better, conceding five goals fewer than he should have, based on the quality of chances faced.",
      "Sunderland will need all four of those players to continue in the same vein against Brentford and the in-form Thiago. But, similarly to the Bees, with whom they are now vying for a European place, they have been quick to show they belong at this level.Nick Wright",

      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 06:11, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek card.",
      "These are the contests that shape relegation battles. It's going to be ugly and full of tension. And one you won't want to miss.",
      "West Ham's Nuno Espírito Santo versus Nottingham Forest's Sean Dyche is a matchup that doesn't exactly scream 'bring your popcorn'. When these two managers have crossed paths across their careers, goals have been at a premium. That is the betting angle here. Across nine previous meetings, there have been just 19 goals in total, with seven of those games finishing under 2.5 goals.",
      "The managerial matchup here, when added to the likely cup final nature, quietly points toward another low-scoring chapter in the Nuno vs Dyche playbook. The 10/11 with Sky Bet for under 2.5 goals is the obvious play.",
      "Cristian Romero likes to defend in a manner that can quickly tip over from assertive to reckless. It's why referees know his name. Eight yellow cards and a red already this season tells its own story.",
      "Bournemouth are very good at inviting chaos that leads to cards. Andoni Iraola's side want to play quickly, get the ball into feet between the lines and force centre-backs to make decisions they don't want to make. That's where Evanilson comes in - a striker who is a genuine card magnet.",
      "Since the start of last season he's drawn 21 cards from opponents - only Bruno Guimarães has drawn more.",
      "Romero is 2/1 with Sky Bet to be carded. It's a bet.",
      "Robin Roefs has been nothing short of sensational since his £11.5m move from NEC Nijmegen in August. Seven clean sheets bagged already this season, including three in the last five games, tells the story. His save ratio of 78.4 per cent is the best in the league.",
      "Roefs leads all goalkeepers for xG prevented at +4.9, meaning he's conceded almost five goals fewer than expected and only Martin Dubravka has made more saves this season (70). Away from home across his last nine games, he's averaging 4.3 saves per 90 where those backing his 4+ saves line have landed the money in seven of those games.",
      "Brentford arrive in great nick, having taken 10 points and scored 10 goals in their last four games, and are turning games into ones where the opposition goalkeeper is constantly called into action. Roefs to make four or more saves at 10/11 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "This fixture is all about the dugout dynamic.",
      "Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner seem to know exactly how to play Aston Villa and Unai Emery. The record is startling. Palace are unbeaten in the last six meetings, winning five of them, with an aggregate score of 19-4. Pure domination.",
      "And when patterns like that persist across different game states, venues and moments in the season, it's fair to declare that Glasner has Emery's number. It's a system Villa have repeatedly struggled to solve. Every time they try to step on Palace, they get pulled into transitional chaos, exactly where Glasner's side thrive.",
      "At Selhurst Park, with Palace's recent dominance in this fixture and a manager who repeatedly outmanoeuvres his opposite number, the fact Palace are the outsiders at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy angle to attack.",
      "Defensively, Wolves look transformed.",
      "Across their last five Premier League matches, Wolves have posted an expected goals against figure of just 1.01 per 90 - it's the second-best defensive record in the league over that sample size. And context elevates it further. This run includes games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool - fixtures that usually inflate defensive numbers rather than squeeze them. West Ham found that out on Saturday.",
      "They were restricted to scraps in terms of attacking return while for the first time this season the Wolves attack found a ruthless streak in the 3-0 win. Similar results may follow in recent weeks.",
      "Everton could struggle to find a way through making the double chance option on the away win a bet to play at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Whether it's Joao Pedro dropping in and rolling defenders or Liam Delap playing on the shoulder and inviting contact, Chelsea's forwards are excellent at turning physical battles into card parties. Fouls get drawn. And cards tend to follow.",
      "Eight centre-backs have been carded against Chelsea in their last 15 games, so Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca could be walking into a proper examination here.",
      "Cuenca's recent record suggests he's not immune to catching the referee's eye. He's been booked in two of his last four games and historically he carries a fairly punchy card profile. A 0.28 cards-per-90 ratio from his time in La Liga tells you he's a defender who plays on the front foot, happy to engage early rather than drop off. The 7/2 with Sky Bet for a Cuenca card has a chance.",
      "Brighton are not your average mid-table Premier League team when visiting the elite, and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shot bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 12 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under Fabian Hurzerler's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 14.5 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.5 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output and one which deserves full respect in this fixture where City could be without their first-choice defensive duo in Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.",
      "The markets are behind on this shots curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet - something they have landed in their last three head-to-heads with Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore.",
      "Newcastle have scored at least twice in each of their last 11 home matches. That attacking consistency was on show again last time out when they delivered exactly what was expected by this column against Crystal Palace, where the 10/11 for a home win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals landed. No need to change a winning formula then.",
      "Expect goals, expect control and expect Newcastle to deliver in front of their own fans yet again. The 4/5 on offer through the Sky Bet BuildABet function for Newcastle to win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals remains a bet to follow.",
      "According to the Premier League title-winning odds, it's never been more likely this season than now that Arsenal will land the outright prize. After Chelsea's late salvo at Manchester City, the 1/4 on offer with Sky Bet on Arsenal for the title is the shortest price they've been all season. Only Arsenal can stop Arsenal now.",
      "For this game the under 2.5 goals line is worth a look at 11/10 with Sky Bet. Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot are cut from a similar cloth. Territory matters. Risk management matters. Neither wants a basketball match",
      "When two managers are this obsessed with control, the game often eats itself. In big games between elite managers of this nature, it often promises drama and delivers tension instead. One goal either way could be enough.",

      "Man Utd must appoint an experienced manager who fits the DNA of the club, says Gary Neville, insisting \"the experiments have got to stop\".",
      "The Portuguese leaves with a wretched record after deploying his back-three system through almost the entirety of his tenure.",
      "Neville believes a failing at Man Utd since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 is that the club have looked to different managers with different philosophies rather than sticking to their traditional principles.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim, a very different style of football than Man Utd would ordinarily expect.",
      "\"The experiments have got to stop.",
      "\"There is a very good video online [where United legend] Bobby Charlton talks about what Man Utd is as a football club. Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd. Man Utd must take risks and be courageous in playing attacking football.",
      "\"Man Utd have got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their club. Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "Neville remains optimistic that United's group of players can still achieve Champions League qualification this season through the Premier League and expects interim boss Darren Fletcher to immediately switch to a back four set-up.",
      "However, he warned that it is difficult to predict how United's season will go if Fletcher is required to take the team until the end of the campaign before a permanent appointment is made in the summer.",
      "\"Manchester United appointed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on a short-term contract and it went really well. It was a big boost for the club. They then appointed Ralf Rangnick on a short-term contract and it was an absolute disaster, so we've experienced both things,\" he said.",
      "\"I think a competent manager, a Premier League manager, should be able to get Manchester United really close to the Champions League positions and really competing for it.",
      "\"Now, people will say, well, that's where Manchester United are right now, and that tells you the story of the Premier League this season.",
      "\"I don't think Manchester United have ever convinced, at any stage, under Amorim, that things were really looking good, and they still find themselves in a healthy position in terms of a league position.",
      "\"That can change really quickly because the league is so tight, but there's enough talent in that squad to have a real push, certainly for European positions.",
      "\"When you look at how poor Liverpool have been, how poor Chelsea have been as well, there could be a real opportunity for them to get in the Champions League.",
      "\"I don't think that will happen, but I do think Manchester United should have more than enough to get a European position.\"",

      "The decision to sack Ruben Amorim became inevitable once the Portuguese coach made it clear this was no long-term project but the unravelling of his Manchester United reign damns the decision-makers as well as the coach, writes Adam Bate",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 14:15, UK",
      "The end of yet another error. Manchester United’s decision to sack Ruben Amorim midway through the season leaves the club in rebuild mode for a second consecutive campaign, their commitment to this latest project unceremoniously abandoned.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe had boldly claimed that Amorim was doing a great job. Omar Berrada, the club's chief executive, argued that come the summer the worst would be behind them. As both are belatedly learning, things can always get worse at United.",
      "August brought defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in their history, Amorim unable to watch as United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby. Fiddling with his tactics board that night, he became the face that launched 1,000 memes.",
      "September brought defeat at Brentford, a game which ended with Amorim repeating his experiment of playing Mason Mount at left wing-back. Only October brought some relief, an unexpected win over Liverpool at Anfield and the manager of the month award.",
      "But, in November, they were beaten by Everton at Old Trafford, losing a Premier League home game against 10 men for the first time. In December, they somehow contrived to allow a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches to leave with a point.",
      "It ends in January after a draw at Leeds, conceding in 15 consecutive away games for the first time in Premier League history. Not because of that result but because the relationship between Amorim and those above him had become broken beyond repair.",
      "The realisation of how much work remained was a source of tension. Amorim had been given a new £200m forward line but still wanted more there and in almost every other area of the pitch. His demands came from a weak position as faith in him faded.",
      "Berrada talked of a \"very clear identity\" but even that was being compromised by the end. Having moved on his wingers, he finally switched to a back four - inexplicably suggesting the reason he had not made the change earlier was because of the media.",
      "Even then, after limping to victory over Newcastle in that system, he reverted back and failed to beat Wolves. Gary Neville was frustrated. That Amorim name-checked him after his final game in charge suggests those frustrations were shared within the club.",
      "United's decision-makers will be criticised for this folly and rightly so. The award of a new contract to Erik ten Hag only to sack him in October of last season did not present the best conditions for Amorim to take the job - something he was acutely aware of.",
      "It always came with risk. Liverpool opted against Amorim because of the incompatibility of his formation, going with the greater continuity afforded by appointing Arne Slot and being rewarded with the Premier League title. But Amorim was on their radar.",
      "His reputation had been well earned, having had nothing but success at Portugal, building the best Sporting side for a generation, a first title in 19 years. And there were very good reasons why United were more amenable to change than Liverpool.",
      "Having finished outside the top seven under Ten Hag, there was an appetite among supporters for something more than mere evolution and Ratcliffe was happy to sell that idea. He wanted to disrupt things at Old Trafford and Amorim could be his instrument.",
      "But few could have anticipated it being quite so fraught.",
      "Amorim was afforded extraordinary levels of patience and Ten Hag's own struggles only partially explain it. The Portuguese picked up fewer points in his first six games than the Dutchman had mustered in his last six - and things actually got worse from there.",
      "Amorim averaged a point a game last season across 27 matches, putting them 16th in the table during that period - which is where they finished. Worth a reminder, perhaps, that while United were meandering when he arrived, they were only four points off third.",
      "Failing to qualify for Europe changed the financial picture, slowing the pace of change and making it more difficult for Amorim to overhaul the squad. Although, his unwillingness to trust Kobbie Mainoo had some fans questioning his plans for it anyway.",
      "There were grumbles when he refused to change shape when chasing games, making like-for-like substitutions in the devastating Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. The familiar sight of swapping centre-backs late on bewildered many at Old Trafford.",
      "And yet, United's match-going supporters are a loyal bunch and few will be celebrating his exit. They had hoped against hope that this would work after more than a decade of disappointments. They were willing to trust that all this was actually going somewhere.",
      "It is why, for all his failings, Amorim was undone by his comments as much as the results. Speaking about his relationship with the club in that press room in Leeds, he concluded: \"[It] is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on.\"",
      "That laid bare to everyone the fact that this new path that Amorim was on was not leading to a new era, the next United dynasty. In his own words, even if the club were to let him to see out his deal, this project was already nearer to the end than the beginning.",
      "Framed in that context, it was only natural to question the point in proceeding down said path. And so, having tried the big characters, the club heroes, United's investment in this tactical bright young thing has been aborted too. The end of yet another error.",
