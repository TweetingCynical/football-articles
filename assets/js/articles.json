      "Avram Glazer (left) is trying to buy an IPL franchise(Image: 2025 Jean Catuffe)",
      "The Glazer family are once again trying to buy an Indian Premier League (IPL) side, with both Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the Rajasthan Royals in their sights. The Glazers already own one T20 franchise and are now reportedly vying for much bigger fish.",
      "Avram Glazer is one of the owners of Manchester United and NFL franchise Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he also has a business interest in cricket. Glazer owns Desert Vipers, one of the franchises in the UAE’s ILT20 tournament, through his company Lancer Capital and has been keen to break into the Indian market for years.",
      "He was unsuccessful in bidding for the two IPL expansion franchises, which became Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans, back in 2021. But the United owner remains undeterred and is now bidding for both RCB and the Royals.",
      "According to State of Play, the Glazers have submitted an offer of around $1.8billion (£1.32bn) to buy Bengaluru, the current IPL champions in both the men’s and women’s competitions. That figure, submitted through New Orleans-based Lancer Capital, makes them one of the highest bidders out of nine competing parties.",
      "They are also in the running to buy Rajasthan, whose process is one step ahead of Bengaluru’s, with a second round approaching. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) rules don’t allow multi-franchise ownership, so, if they are successful, the Glazer family may have to choose between the two franchises.",
      "The Cricket Monthly reported that the Glazers’ bids for the Ahmedabad and Lucknow franchises in 2021 were the lowest of all the contenders. The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group bought the Lucknow team after submitting an offer in excess of £686m, while the Titans went to private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for £541m.",
      "The Glazers seem eager not to miss out this time, with the IPL having gone from strength to strength commercially as the world ’s biggest and most lucrative T20 league.",
      "Royal Challengers Bengaluru won the IPL for the first time in 2025(Image: Pankaj Nangia/Getty Images)",
      "It was also reported that Avram Glazer – the family member keenest on expanding into cricket – wanted to leverage the Manchester United brand in the sport. Sheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the son of the ruler of Dubai, tweeted in March 2022 that he’d met Avram and had discussed “the UAE T20 Cricket league's launch in Jan 2023 featuring Manchester United cricket team & other teams.”",
      "That idea didn’t get off the ground due to copyright issues, but the Glazers haven’t been deterred from pursuing cricket as an avenue. The IPL move isn’t the only reported consideration in India, either, with Indian cricket legend Sourav Ganguly revealing in 2022 that the Glazers had held talks about taking over Indian Super League side East Bengal.",
      "The Glazer family has owned United since 2005 and have been extremely unpopular for the majority of that time. They sold a 26.2 per cent stake to Sir Jim Ratcliffe for £1.3bn in February 2024 and the British petrochemicals billionaire is now responsible for the day-to-day running of the Premier League side.",

      "The 18-year-old has been named on the United bench for eight matches this season, having impressed in brief appearances against Villa, Burnley and Brighton in the FA Cup. Despite receiving a yellow card against Brighton, he was warmly applauded by supporters as he left the pitch.",
      "Lacey may continue to find himself among the substitutes in the weeks ahead. But Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko are already vying for just three attacking spots.",

      "Rio Ferdinand endured a night to forget for Manchester United in 2006(Image: John Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "David Bentley has claimed his iconic hat-trick against Manchester United led to a nightclub confrontation with Rio Ferdinand. The 41-year-old played a starring role as Blackburn Rovers earned a memorable 4-3 win at Ewood Park in February 2006.",
      "The former Arsenal starlet had started the season on loan at Blackburn under manager Mark Hughes. The then-21-year-old agreed to make his move permanent in the January transfer window, sealing the deal on the eve of the club’s clash with United.",
      "Rovers raced into a 3-1 lead during the first half. Bentley opened the scoring by tapping home a rebound from a free-kick and later helped his side regain the lead by pouncing on Rio Ferdinand’s flicked header back after miscommunication with goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. A Lucas Neill penalty rounded off the scoreline at the break.",
      "In the second half, Bentley showcased his quality with a swerving half-volley into the far corner. A brace from Ruud van Nistelrooy failed to salvage a point for Sir Alex Ferguson's side, who were reduced to 10 men after a late red card for Ferdinand. According to Bentley, his post-match comments also frustrated the defender, who sought him out in a nightclub.",
      "\"It was Rio, wasn’t it, I said something. You know what, there’s a story about that. So Rio headed it on to Van Der Sar and I nipped in,\" Bentley recalled to Clutch 9 Powered by Betway.",
      "\"My agent Rob Segal, he’d set up a Sky interview for the day after. That’s what they do, don’t they, get you out there. I’d said a joke about Rio but he got the right hump! Me and him had a little bit of a square up in a nightclub in Manchester over it.",
      "\"He didn’t like it because he thought I’d disrespected him. I went, ‘I just want to say thanks to Rio, nice little flick-on.’ He got the hump. Everyone used to be in this same nightclub and he came up and we had a little bit of a dance around for a bit.\"",
      "Remarkably, his hat-trick would be the only league goals Bentley scored that season but he still played a key role as Blackburn finished sixth to earn a UEFA Cup spot. Meanwhile, United came second to Chelsea, finishing eight points behind Jose Mourinho's side.",
      "David Bentley scored a hat-trick against Manchester United the day after signing permanently for Blackburn Rovers(Image: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)",
      "The winger continued to produce stellar performances for Blackburn over the next two seasons. England boss Steve McClaren labelled Bentley the “new David Beckham” but the Rovers star was made to wait for his senior international debut after controversially withdrawing from U21 duty.",
      "As a result, Bentley was jeered by some England fans when earning his first cap as a substitute against Israel. However, in a full circle moment, it was Ferdinand who leapt to the winger’s defence.",
      "\"We had such a good performance and everyone was quite happy but what happened with David left a bad taste in the mouth,\" Ferdinand said. \"The lad is on England duty and you don't expect him to get booed, no matter what has happened in the past.",
      "Ferdiannd and Bentley later became England teammates(Image: Mike Marsland/WireImage)",
      "\"In some quarters, people might say what he did in the summer was a wrong decision but in hindsight, it is easy to say that. He is a young lad, on a learning curve, making his seniors debut for England and he did not deserve to be booed.\"",
      "Bentley completed a high-profile move to Tottenham Hotspur in 2008 but failed to hit the same heights in a Spurs shirt, eventually losing his place to Aaron Lennon. The seven-cap England international was subsequently loaned out to several clubs, including Birmingham City, West Ham United and Russian outfit Rostov.",
      "He made a brief return to Rovers during the 2012/13 season, featuring on seven occasions for the Championship side. Bentley was released by Spurs at the end of the campaign and confirmed his retirement a year later, aged 29.",

      "Michael Carrick has given a Manchester United injury update ahead of the game against Tottenham(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United take on Tottenham Hotspur this weekend, aiming to maintain their winning streak under interim head coach Michael Carrick. The Red Devils have triumphed in all three matches under the ex-midfielder's guidance, sparking optimism for Champions League football at Old Trafford next season.",
      "Carrick's squad will welcome Tottenham to their home ground in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off (12.30pm). Ahead of the match, they occupy fourth place in the league standings, a single point ahead of fifth-placed Chelsea.",
      "Tottenham currently find themselves in 14th position, but managed to claw back from a 2-0 deficit at half-time to secure a 2-2 draw with Manchester City in their previous match last weekend. In the run-up to the Old Trafford clash, both managers have provided updates on their squad's availability.",
      "Carrick shared worrying news about Matthijs de Ligt. The central defender has been absent from the last 12 games across all competitions due to a back issue.",
      "Carrick confirmed that the upcoming match will come 'too soon' for the player. \"Matta [De Ligt], he's working his way back, taking good steps and improving,\" the United interim manager stated in his pre-match press conference. \"It's a little bit too soon at the moment but, hopefully, it won't be too long [before De Ligt is back].\"",
      "He could be joined on the bench by midfielder Mason Mount, who missed the victory over Fulham after picking up an injury in training. This puts his participation in this weekend's match into serious doubt.",
      "\"Probably, Mason [will be available] sooner [than De Ligt],\" Carrick said. \"He's not too far away really. We're hopeful it won't be too long.\"",
      "Another player set to miss out is full-back Patrick Dorgu. He picked up a hamstring problem during the match against Arsenal.",
      "Speaking last week, Carrick confirmed that the setback would sideline him for 'a few weeks'. The Danish defender had been performing impressively for United since the interim manager's arrival, making his absence a significant setback.",
      "As for Tottenham, they continue to grapple with an extensive injury list. There remains uncertainty surrounding striker Dominic Solanke's fitness, after he was substituted during the stalemate with City due to an ankle problem.",
      "Patrick Dorgu will miss Manchester United's match against Tottenham through injury(Image: Justin Setterfield, Getty Images)",
      "Whilst Solanke's participation remains in doubt, nine players are confirmed absentees for the fixture. Spurs will be missing Pedro Porro, Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Bergvall, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur, Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Ben Davies, and Kevin Danso, as the injury crisis deepens.",
      "On a more positive note for Spurs, boss Thomas Frank has confirmed that centre-backs Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero will be fit for the encounter with United. They could potentially be accompanied by full-back Djed Spence.",
      "\"So Micky is good, [he] trained today,\" the Spurs boss stated. \"He is available for selection for Saturday.",
      "\"So it's good. Djed Spence is getting closer. It will be a little bit touch and go, but there is a good chance that he will be ready.\"",

      "The 44-year-old has enjoyed a strong start to his second spell at Old Trafford, securing victories in his opening three fixtures against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham. The winning streak has propelled them back into the Premier League's top four, sitting five points adrift of third-placed Aston Villa.",
      "Since returning to United, Carrick has introduced several modifications. On the field, he has adapted Amorim's strict 3-4-3 system and brought Kobbie Mainoo back into the first XI.",
      "Away from the pitch, Carrick has chosen to address his squad after matches, something Amorim rarely did, according to The Athletic. Whilst he reserves the in-depth tactical breakdown for subsequent days, Carrick has made a deliberate effort to engage with his United players in the changing room, with certain feedback given on a one-to-one basis in another move away from the Amorim era.",
      "This follows reports that Carrick has abandoned Erik ten Hag and Amorim's approach of making United players train the day after fixtures. Carrick has instead introduced mandatory rest days within 24 hours of matches, with recovery work now scheduled to occur two days following the final whistle.",
      "Carrick has chosen to dismantle several of Amorim's approaches whilst introducing his own methods and philosophy. Amorim had decided to prohibit players from taking holidays during international breaks and banned food from being brought into the changing room.",
      "The former Sporting CP manager even prevented his own coaching staff from delivering detailed tactical instructions to his United players.",
      "Carrick has also reduced the length of training sessions but increased the intensity of drills. He has altered the time his squad arrives for fixtures, both when travelling for away matches and home games at Old Trafford.",
      "Michael Carrick has made an impressive start to life back at Manchester United(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "His modifications have proved effective, with United gaining momentum and appearing well-placed to compete for a Champions League spot. Next up for the Reds is a fixture against Tottenham on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Despite Spurs having failed to win any of their last five Premier League matches, Carrick is anticipating a \"big challenge\" from Thomas Frank's side. \"They certainly bring a challenge,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"The way they finished the game the other day, they've had, over a period, players injured, a lot of changes to the team which makes things more difficult. They're getting players back, they have really good attackers that look to stretch the backline and play forward and attack the box an awful lot.",
      "\"A slightly different game to what we've played in recent weeks but we're looking forward to, we are in a good place, the boys have worked well again this week. Feet on the ground, let's not get carried away. It's about what's next. Big challenge ahead.\"",

      "His current deal with PSG, whom he led to Champions League glory last season, runs until the end of 2026-27. It has been suggested United tried to persuade him not to sign a new contract.",

Spanish reports this week suggested that the La Liga champions are now ready to make Rashford's move permanent.",
      "The 28-year-old's loan stint at Camp Nou is set to end when the season wraps up, but he has already admitted that he hopes to extend his stay with the Spanish champions. Earlier this month, rumours indicated that the Catalan giants were reluctant to pay the previously agreed fee for a permanent deal, offering United two alternatives: signing Rashford for a lesser amount or extending his loan for another season with a compulsory purchase in 2027.",

And the report also claims that the forward is ready to lower his salary to align with their wage structure amid the club's well-documented financial issues.",
      "Rashford has netted 10 goals and provided 13 assists for Barcelona so far this season, and when asked about joining the Catalan giants permamently back in October, he said: “Oh yeah, for sure. I’m enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game so to play here is an honour.",
      "“I just believe that things happen when they’re supposed to happen. It’s not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn’t happen in the past, and now is my opportunity to make it happen. I feel like there’s no time like the present now.”",
      "While speaking just last month, Flick lauded Rashford by saying: \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season. We have to wait.",

      "Michael Carrick has implemented several changes already at Manchester United(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "Michael Carrick's Manchester United revolution has seen him transform the club both on and off the pitch after just three weeks at the helm. The legendary former United midfielder was appointed as interim head coach until the end of the season in January.",
      "He replaced the recently sacked Ruben Amorim, whose miserable 14-month spell in Manchester ended seemingly following disputes with the club hierarchy over tactics and transfer business.",
      "Since taking charge, the 44-year-old has secured three wins from three fixtures, restoring hope at United and delivering football that reflects the club's 'DNA'. A convincing 2-0 win in the Manchester Derby was followed by a 3-2 victory away at league leaders Arsenal, before securing a late winner against Fulham last weekend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Both Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag required players who featured in games to attend the training ground the following day for recovery work. Carrick has scrapped this rule, instead granting designated rest days within 24 hours of a fixture. Recovery sessions have now been rescheduled to take place two days after the final whistle.",
      "Amorim enforced a rigid 3-4-3 system and was unwilling to stray from his approach, despite his squad being better equipped for a more conventional formation. That meant dropping certain players, including academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo, from the first team.",
      "However, a crucial element of Carrick's transformation has been scrapping the 3-4-3 shape and reverting to a more traditional United-style 4-2-3-1 with fast-paced wing play. He has also brought fan favourite Mainoo back into the starting eleven.",
      "Training was very different under Ruben Amorim(Image: Crystal Pix/MB Media, Getty Images)",
      "Amorim prohibited food from being taken into the dressing room after emphasising the need to improve player fitness standards, potentially affecting team morale in doing so. Carrick is understood to be scrapping that policy by transforming the dressing room into a haven for players, where they can feel valued.",
      "He has introduced a new philosophy that players must not leave the dressing room until they feel they have been addressed and listened to, by speaking to players immediately after matches. Harry Maguire is reportedly someone who will spearhead this approach and become an influential voice.",
      "That's a departure from Amorim's tenure, where players were supposedly dismissed after matches, frequently without him addressing them, to allow emotions to settle before making hasty decisions. He would then share his views the next day as it afforded him an opportunity to further analyse aspects of the match and provide a measured evaluation once the heat of matchday had subsided.",
      "Amorim reportedly prevented his own coaching team from delivering complex tactical instructions to the players in order to maintain simplicity. Carrick has changed the coaching structure, allowing for a different flow of information and instruction.",
      "Players have been impressed by the more direct involvement of Carrick and his staff in contrast to Amorim, who participated but sometimes chose to watch rather than intervene.",
      "Manchester United players now arrive later to matches(Image: Getty)",
      "A minor adjustment Carrick has made is having his players arrive at Old Trafford for fixtures slightly closer to kick-off time. The different pre-match routine has been brought in to try to freshen things up, with Amorim being strict on earlier arrival times ahead of fixtures.",
      "For the Premier League victory against City, the team bus turned up around 15 minutes later than normal. This was a deliberate change by Carrick to prevent his players from waiting around in the ground ahead of kick-off, while also guaranteeing his squad received a strong reception.",
      "Carrick has reduced the length of training sessions but raised the intensity of the drills undertaken, with a focus on tailored one-to-one coaching as well. Under Amorim, training sessions were longer but were lower in intensity and had different tactical focuses.",
      "It is believed Carrick made the change to stress the importance of performing at one's best each day. Reports suggest the energy in training is now a far cry from that under Amorim, with Carrick aided by two new assistant coaches in Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate.",
      "Carrick is trusting players like Kobbie Mainoo (Image: Getty)",
      "Amorim left fans and former players frustrated by appearing to overlook the club's gifted youngsters who had progressed through the academy. While the Portuguese manager did hand opportunities to players such as Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Ayden Heaven, he also publicly criticised them, alongside Mainoo, which seemed unusual for a United boss to do.",
      "Carrick, in contrast, has already shown a stronger commitment to providing young players with opportunities and engaging with the club's academy more broadly. He recalled youngsters such as Habeeb Ogunneye from loan and Joe Hugill to train with the first team.",
      "He's also been spotted watching youth team fixtures - something Amorim was criticised for neglecting - which will reassure academy prospects that there is a genuine route to the first team.",

Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.",

      "Michael Carrick didn't sign anyone in January but is fortunate to still have one of Manchester United's best winter transfers at his disposal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The January transfer window was a quiet one for Manchester United, but the silver lining behind that is that a more productive summer may be around the corner.",
      "Michael Carrick didn't bring any new signings to Old Trafford last month and emerges from the window with the same squad he inherited. That's despite the fact that some of the club's all-time best signings just so happen to have arrived in the winter.",
      "Based on his fast start at the United helm, Carrick may just get the chance to conduct business for his old side in the future. And if all goes to plan, he'll still be at the helm at the start of 2027 to have his first real crack at January dealings",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Arguably one of the greatest January signings in Premier League history, Nemanja Vidic emerged from relative anonymity at Spartak Moscow to become one of the finest defenders the Premier League has witnessed. The Serbian joined for a modest £7million in January 2005 and claimed his first trophy with United after barely a month, defeating Wigan Athletic to secure that season's League Cup.",
      "Vidic's legacy at Old Trafford is nothing short of remarkable - 15 trophies, including five Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League. Sir Alex Ferguson didn't mince his words when describing the Serbian's consistency, whose legendary defensive partnership with Rio Ferdinand became the stuff of United folklore.",
      "\"I always used to say Denis Irwin would give us eight or nine out of 10 every week, but he never got a mention when the praise was being given out,\" the Scot said in 2009. \"We all knew the value of him, and it is very much the same with Vidic. He has been a fantastic performer for us.\"",
      "Few fans may have known Nemanja Vidic's name when he arrived in England, but they certainly did by the time he left(Image: Alex Livesey, Getty Images)",
      "Few United supporters would dispute Paul Scholes' status as a club legend. However, many overlook the extraordinary fact this one-club hero technically signed for the Red Devils on more than one occasion.",
      "At 36, Scholes hung up his boots in the summer of 2011. Yet Ferguson sensed his midfield maestro had unfinished business - and his instincts proved spot on. The ginger genius made a sensational return halfway through the 2011/12 season, netting four league goals in the latter half of the campaign, his best tally since 2006/07.",
      "Despite United narrowly missing out on the title as City dramatically snatched the crown on goal difference, Scholes stayed put to claim his 11th and final Premier League trophy in 2013. However, he later confessed he felt the comeback was a misjudgement.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is United's best January recruit of the modern era(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "The only member of this list still on the books at United, Bruno Fernandes ignored interest from other European big guns to sign in January 2020. And the former Sporting CP playmaker has succeeded in lifting the standards at the Theatre of Dreams, just as he did in Lisbon.",
      "Some will say the jury is still out on whether Fernandes has justified the initial £47m paid for his services given an FA Cup and League Cup is all they've lifted in the six years since he arrived. However, his 88 goals and 77 assists in 268 appearances for United, and the fact he was made captain in 2023, speaks volumes of his work.",
      "Fan favourites don't get a lot more beloved than Patrice Evra, who supposedly snubbed interest from Arsenal, Liverpool and Real Madrid to join United. Five Premier League titles, one Champions League crown and 379 appearances later, the Frenchman had secured his spot as an Old Trafford icon.",
      "Ferguson moved for Evra in January 2006 because of an injury crisis in defence at the time, but his £5.5m arrival soon looked like a steal. Evra ousted Gabriel Heinze from the left-back spot permanently and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season on three occasions.",
      "Patrice Evra was an understated signing under Sir Alex Ferguson but went on to become an all-time great(Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "United icon Ferguson had a knack for poaching the Premier League's most prolific goalscorers from rival clubs, and Louis Saha's signing in January 2004 exemplified this perfectly. The French striker had netted 15 goals for Fulham in the opening half of that campaign and arrived to bolster United's attacking options.",
      "Whilst Saha's spell at Old Trafford was hampered by fitness problems, he still managed a respectable tally of 42 goals and 16 assists across 124 appearances for United. As one of Wayne Rooney's preferred striking partners, he delivered what was required when available and secured two Premier League titles, one League Cup and a Champions League winner's medal for his efforts.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Carrick has lifted the mood at United(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United will aim to make it four consecutive wins under interim manager Michael Carrick as they host Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford in a captivating Premier League encounter on Saturday lunchtime. This marks the first meeting between the sides since their dramatic 2-2 draw in North London back in August, when Matthijs de Ligt netted a 96th-minute equaliser for United.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim’s departure and Carrick’s appointment, Manchester United appear revitalized, collecting a perfect nine points from three matches under their new boss and extending their unbeaten league run to seven games. The Red Devils have notched impressive victories over title contenders Arsenal and Manchester City, before edging out Fulham 3-2 last weekend thanks to Benjamin Sesko’s stoppage-time winner. Confidence is understandably high at Old Trafford, with United currently sitting fourth in the table—one point clear of Chelsea in fifth and two ahead of Liverpool in sixth. A win on Saturday would see United surpass last season’s 42-point total with 13 matches still remaining.",
      "Victory against Tottenham would also give Manchester United four straight league wins for the first time since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag. However, recent history against Spurs has not favored United, who are winless in their last six league meetings with the North London side (three draws, three losses)—matching their longest such run, which dates back to 1914-1921.",
      "Tottenham, led by Thomas Frank, have struggled at home this season—only Wolves have picked up fewer home points than Spurs’ 10. After a lackluster first half against Manchester City last weekend, Spurs rallied in the second half, with Dominic Solanke scoring twice—including a fortuitous scorpion kick—to secure a 2-2 draw and a valuable point. Nevertheless, Tottenham are winless in their last six Premier League matches (four draws, two losses), their longest such streak since the end of last season, and currently sit 14th in the table—closer to the relegation zone (nine points clear) than the top five (11 points adrift).",
      "Spurs may welcome the prospect of playing away from home, as five of their seven league wins this season have come on the road. Only Arsenal (24) and Aston Villa (21) have earned more away points than Tottenham’s 19 so far. Additionally, Spurs are unbeaten in their last eight meetings with Manchester United across all competitions (five wins, three draws)—a feat only bettered by Chelsea’s 12-match run against United between 2012 and 2017. Tottenham also claimed a 3-0 victory at Old Trafford last season and have only once before won back-to-back top-flight away games against United, achieving that in January 2014.",
      "Manchester United will be without Patrick Dorgu (thigh) and Matthijs de Ligt (back), who remain sidelined through injury. Mason Mount is also a doubt after picking up a knock in training and will be assessed ahead of kickoff. Manager Michael Carrick is likely to stick with his successful starting lineup, but may consider recalling Benjamin Sesko to the attack following his decisive impact off the bench in the previous match. Should Sesko return to the starting XI, one of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo, or Matheus Cunha would likely make way.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes, who leads the Premier League with 12 assists this season—a personal best equaled only in the 2020-21 campaign—is expected to continue in his advanced central midfield role behind the main striker.",
      "For Tottenham, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski (both knee), Mohammed Kudus (thigh), Pedro Porro, Richarlison, Rodrigo Bentancur (all hamstring), Ben Davies, Lucas Bergvall (both ankle), and Kevin Danso (toe) are all unavailable due to injury. Micky van de Ven (unspecified) and Djed Spence (calf) missed the draw with Manchester City, while both Dominic Solanke (fitness) and Cristian Romero were unable to complete the full 90 minutes; all four will be assessed ahead of kickoff.",
      "Solanke, who has netted five goals in his last five appearances against Manchester United in all competitions, will be hoping to recover in time to lead the line. Wilson Odobert and Mathys Tel are both pushing for a recall in attack, either to partner or replace Randal Kolo Muani and Xavi Simons.",

      "Michael Carrick may have a route to bring Scott McTominay back to Manchester United this summer(Image: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick is hard at work attempting to preserve and prolong his meteoric start as interim Manchester United manager. And the Red Devils play host to Tottenham in Saturday's early Premier League kick-off, hoping to make it four wins from four under the club icon.",
      "Whatever Carrick has been doing at his old stomping ground thus far, it's working. Despite being at the club on temporary terms as things stand, the 44-year-old hasn't been afraid to tear up trees in an effort to put his old side back on top of the English pyramid.",
      "United had a quiet January transfer window, where the only business to speak of was through the departures. That bodes well in terms of a bigger budget to spend in the summer, however, at which point it may be Carrick making the decisions on a longer-term basis.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Recent examples of players returning to Old Trafford after long stints away haven't fallen in their favour over recent years. Expensive moves to bring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Pogba back to the club ultimately failed to live up to expectations.",
      "But many fans will hope McTominay could buck that trend in the event United come back in for their academy graduate in future. To that effect, recent comments made by Napoli’s global business development officer, Leonardo Giammarioli, suggest the transfer can be done for the right price.",
      "\"Yeah, of course I’m worried,\" he told talkSPORT when discussing the prospect of McTominay leaving should a suitable offer come in. \"But ultimately, especially Scott, who’s a very nice guy, we’re happy if he gets to the next level in a couple of years. Maybe not now, maybe not next year, but he deserves it.",
      "\"Look at Stuttgart, they wanted to keep Nick Woltemade [before he joined Newcastle last summer], but when such an offer comes in, there’s not much you can do, when the player wants to go and money is important.\"",

      "It's common knowledge by now that Napoli got themselves a serious bargain after acquiring the Scot for around £25million in the summer of 2024. Many suggested at the time the player was underrated, and then-manager Erik ten Hag even confessed he didn't want to sell his star.",
      "One Serie A title and a Player of the Year award later, McTominay is one of the most valuable assets in Italy's top flight. Again, United would be forced to pay a premium for a player they may well regret selling in the first place, but the need to replace the outgoing Casemiro - and potentially Bruno Fernandes, too - could make him a sensible summer target.",
      "One thing that's been clear early on in Carrick's reign is that he's not worried about upsetting the status quo. And that goes just as much for established traditions at United, as well as something as ordinary as tactical tweaks.",
      "Carrick has laid down a marker both on and off the field at Old Trafford(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)",
      "The ex-England midfielder has already ditched Ruben Amorim's three-at-the-back formation in favour of a more standard set-up. He's also brought Kobbie Mainoo in from his exile and found success switching left-back Patrick Dorgu into a more advanced role.",
      "However, it's now emerged Carrick has done away with Amorim and Ten Hag's practice of making players train the day after matches, per the Sun. Both his predecessors favoured the habit of making the squad attend recovery sessions the day after playing - but no more.",
      "Instead, Carrick has altered the schedule so that United's players undergo their recovery sessions two days after playing. And it's but the latest example of Carrick's more humane touch, giving his stars a more relaxed working atmosphere, at least in one way.",

      "Wayne Rooney's eldest son, Kai, has been offered a new contract by Manchester United(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "The 16-year-old son of Wayne Rooney, Kai, has reportedly been offered a contract by Manchester United as he bids to follow in the footsteps of his famous father.",
      "Kai has been in the United academy for several years and is an attacker, just like Rooney Senior. And after impressing in the youth ranks, Kai is among a group of 14 very highly-rated youngsters who have been offered new terms by United.",
      "According to The Sun, Kai and Jacey Carrick, the son of the Red Devils' current head coach, Michael, have been offered new deals along with others. If accepted, Rooney Jr would pen a one-year scholarship which would then become a three-year professional deal when he turns 17.",
      "The report claims said contract would see him earn around £50,000-a-year plus an annual signing-on fee, though the Rooney family have yet to green light the deal.",
      "A source told the outlet: “The group is very strong and the majority of the boys including Kai and Jacey have been offered deals. It means when they finish school they can go into full-time ‘football employment’ and then when they turn 17 are guaranteed a pro status.",
      "“They still have a long way to go to make the grade, but they can be very proud that the club thinks they have a chance of making it.”",
      "Kai could soon follow in his famous father's footsteps(Image: Getty)",
      "However, Kai seemed to pour cold water on the reports, posting on his Instagram story: \"Don't listen to mail.\"",
      "Wayne, the club's all-time record goalscorer, spoke of his pride last month after watching his eldest son represent Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup against Derby County.",
      "He said: “Kai got moved up to the under-18s squad for the Youth Cup and it was great to see him come on. It brought back memories of when I played in the Youth Cup for Everton.",
      "“It was a proud moment and I’m delighted for him. Hopefully he continues that and he can have a good run with the team.”",
      "Kai’s mum, Coleen, has made it clear that they have not pressured their children into following in Wayne’s footsteps. Speaking to The Mirror in September 2024, she said: “We've never pressured them into even playing football. We've always just let them decide what they want to do. My eight-year-old was playing and doing really well but then decided he didn't want to, and that's OK.",
      "Kai with his parents, Wayne and Coleen(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I think they sometimes get pressure off other people, you know. People approach them now and then if we're out, they do say, 'Are you are as good as your dad?' Kai says 'I'm a different type of player.' You've got to let them know that you don't have to follow and to be your own person.”",
      "Wayne, meanwhile, has been happy to see Michael Carrick and his coaching staff take an interest in the academy since taking charge. He said on his BBC podcast last month: “It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy. In the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest.",
      "Wayne, pictured with Kai, is Manchester United's record goalscorer(Image: Man Utd via Getty Images)",
      "“On Saturday, they were all at the under-16s game as well before they travelled to London. It is great to see that coming back into the club.",
      "“I have been quite vocal on this. It used to be the norm but it has been missing in the last few years. With my two lads in the academy, I haven't seen that and it was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players and the players' parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.”",

      "The former Sporting boss arrived at Old Trafford in November 2024 and led United to 15th, their lowest Premier League finish on record, and a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. Amorim's tenure was plagued by inconsistent form and a muddled style of play.",
      "The Portuguese was heavily criticised for his tactical inflexibility, having stuck with a back-three for the majority of his tenure at M16 - despite calls for him to show greater versatility. The 41-year-old was initially succeeded by Darren Fletcher for two games before Carrick was appointed until the end of the season.",
      "And United's temporary boss has had an impressive impact so far with wins over the league's top two, Manchester City and Arsenal, before a thrilling 3-2 victory over Fulham last weekend. The Red Devils currently sit fourth in the top-flight table amid growing optimism that they will secure a return to the Champions League.",

There is no European football at all this term for Carrick's men, but ex-Newcastle United striker Shearer has explained to Betfair why they have every chance of getting back into the Champions League for the 2026/27 campaign.",

      "The 44-year-old said: \"They certainly bring a challenge. The way they finished the game the other day, they’ve had, over a period, players injured, a lot of changes to the team, which makes things more difficult.",
      "\"They’re getting players back, they have really good attackers that look to stretch the backline and play forward and attack the box an awful lot. A slightly different game to what we’ve played in recent weeks, but we’re looking forward to it.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo is set to miss his second successive game for Al-Nassr as he continues to strike against Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fun (PIF).",
      "Ronaldo, 41, sat out of Monday's 1-0 win against Al-Riyadh due to his frustration with PIF, who own the 'Big Four' in Saudi, over a lack of transfer movement at the club.",
      "His anger escalated when he saw title rivals Al-Hilal, who sit one point and one place above them in the Saudi Pro League, make Karim Benzema their fifth signing of the January transfer window.",
      "Al-Nassr, meanwhile, did little in terms of recruitment in the winter market. They made just two incoming transfers with Abdullah Al-Hamdan signed from Al-Hilal and Haydeer Abdulkareem brought in from Al-Zawraa.",
      "Although Ronaldo has trained with his Al-Nassr teammates this week, he won't be back available to face Al-Ittihad in their next game on Friday evening, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "It's added there are no issues between Ronaldo and Al-Nassr's staff or management, as well as no injury or fitness problems. The Portugal international remains 'upset' about PIF's management with some Saudi clubs.",
      "Senior Al-Nassr officials were confident that Ronaldo would end his strike to play against Al-Ittihad and were shocked that the United and Real Madrid legend has been left displeased with PIF.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo is on strike(Image: Abdullah Ahmed, Getty Images)",

      "Manchester United supporters are bound to be on high alert whenever there's chatter about Cristiano Ronaldo potentially changing clubs. And it seems the Old Trafford legend might be set for another move amid rumours of unrest at Al-Nassr.",
      "Reports have surfaced indicating Ronaldo is on strike in Riyadh and refusing to take to the pitch for his current club. The alleged protest is apparently due to Ronaldo's dissatisfaction with Al-Nassr's lack of transfer activity as he strives to secure his first league title in Saudi Arabia.",
      "If this door does indeed close, it could open a window of opportunity for other clubs. Even after celebrating his 41st birthday on Thursday, Ronaldo will not be lacking in options.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "There are those at Old Trafford who would gladly welcome Ronaldo back, even if it wasn't in a playing role. This comes after former team-mate Wes Brown suggested the Portugal captain could be \"perfect\" for a boardroom position.",
      "Some are sure to remain sceptical about whether the iconic striker possesses the nous required for a boardroom role. Particularly as the Red Devils are finally beginning to demonstrate signs of coherent planning following years of baffling recruitment decisions off the field.",
      "Yet having shared a dressing room with Ronaldo, Brown reckons he's got the credentials for such a transition. However, he acknowledges much will hinge on what the Portuguese superstar wants to do next, especially after his second spell at the Theatre of Dreams fizzled out disappointingly in 2022.",
      "Ronaldo's United link could be revived this summer(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"You never know what Cristiano Ronaldo wants to do, but you can't doubt him after everything he's achieved,\" Brown told 10bet Casino. \"I think first of all, it depends how he's doing in Saudi Arabia, because it's not clear he'll be stopping any time soon - he's still banging them in for Al Nassr.",
      "\"But he could definitely move into the boardroom, he's got the ability to swerve away from coaching and into the executive level, 100 per cent. Why not? If he's enjoying it, it'll be perfect for him.\"",
      "Regardless, it's tricky to picture Ronaldo hanging up his boots just yet. The five-time Ballon d'Or champion sits just 39 strikes shy of the mythical 1,000-goal milestone he's been chasing for years, making it virtually guaranteed he'll extend his playing career for at least another season.",
      "Among all the leagues beyond Saudi Arabia where Ronaldo might reach that milestone, Major League Soccer appears an ideal destination. Deep down, supporters globally would simply relish the prospect of another showdown with Messi.",
      "The most legendary individual rivalry in the modern sport seemingly reached its finale in January 2023. It was then that Messi's Paris Saint-Germain triumphed 5-4 over a combined Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal side in a friendly exhibition.",
      "Yet the former Barcelona and Real Madrid adversaries might orchestrate one final chapter stateside. Messi remains in brilliant form for Inter Miami and is tied to David Beckham's club through 2028, providing ample opportunity for the pair to face off several more times should Ronaldo relocate to America.",
      "The greatest rivalry in modern football could be resurrected if Ronaldo moves to MLS(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Some might even fantasise about Ronaldo and Messi playing alongside each other. Though fitting Ronaldo into Inter Miami's already stretched wage structure would likely prove impossible.",
      "That said, nothing prevents another MLS club from exploiting similar Designated Player regulations to accommodate Ronaldo's substantial earnings. The league's track record of providing elite strikers the perfect platform to boost their scoring records could prove irresistible.",
      "Should Ronaldo depart Al-Nassr in the near future, he'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to his next destination. A sentimental return to Sporting CP, where his journey began, could be a possibility, though such a move might be driven more by nostalgia than practicality.",
      "Ronaldo joined Sporting's academy aged 12 and had barely begun his professional career when Sir Alex Ferguson swooped in. That said, the appeal of stepping up the competition at this stage of his career might not be particularly strong.",
      "Ronaldo is bound to have his pick of moves if he decides to leave Al-Nassr(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Alternatively, a switch within Saudi Arabia could provide the modest change he's seeking. This is particularly feasible given several clubs backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF) could realistically make such a transfer happen.",
      "Al-Hilal especially have demonstrated their financial muscle in the transfer market and recently secured Ronaldo's former Real colleague Karim Benzema. However, that reunion could bring its own complications after ESPN reported Ronaldo tried to prevent his move from Al-Ittihad, because he believed it would hand Al-Hilal excessive advantage in this season's title race.",
      "But if you can't beat them, join them. Not only would a potential partnership between Ronaldo and Benzema generate significant interest, but it could offer Ronaldo the most straightforward path to finally claiming the Saudi championship he's longed for.",

      "United want a couple of midfielders, but if they go for one of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton or Carlos Baleba, I think they will look abroad for a second.

      "Lacey might get games on the bench still, but Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko are already four players for three spots.",
      "The other youngster to maybe keep an eye on is Jack Moorhouse. He returned from a loan spell at Leyton Orient on deadline day and has trained with the first team this week. If there is an injury in midfield, he might get a chance.",
      "Why didn't we sign a midfielder this summer?",
      "Because no long-term target became available. United were adamant they wouldn't make any short-term moves and they stuck to their word.",
      "It might be a risk not to sign a midfielder, but there are only 14 games left and any deal would have been to add back-up. I'm not sure it was really needed.",
      "There are some long breaks coming up between fixtures and Carrick has his work cut out to keep everyone happy as it is. If Casemiro or Mainoo get injured, then maybe it will look like a mistake, but for now, I don't think it was really necessary.",
      "Will Carrick get the job full-time if he gets us into the top four comfortably?",
      "You would have to think there is a chance. United insist the process is going to be thorough and Carrick is keeping his feet on the ground, but a top-four finish makes a strong argument for him.",
      "It's not impossible that United even reel in Aston Villa for third. If Carrick continues to impress, then he will probably give himself an excellent chance of a Premier League job next season, whatever his Old Trafford bosses decide.",
      "The question then might be whether they are prepared to let him go and shine elsewhere. There is a lot more football to be played this season, but Carrick's start has put him firmly in the frame.",
      "Is there a young midfielder who could replace Casemiro?",
      "I don't think there is, to be honest. There are some good youngsters coming through, but nobody in midfield that you would say is on Kobbie Mainoo's level and ready to make an impact.",
      "Moorhouse might get a chance and Jack Fletcher has already, but I'd be surprised if either was in the first-team squad next season. Sekou Kone is someone whom United have high hopes for, but the 20-year-old needs to do plenty of developing in Lausanne in the second half of the season.",
      "What are the chances that if we continue like this we can take the title?",
      "Who says people are getting carried away? In truth, I'd say the chances are non-existent. The gap is 12 points and even if United win their remaining 14 Premier League games, Arsenal would need to lose four. They have had a wobble recently, but that just isn't going to happen.",
      "A more realistic target would be to try and catch Villa. That gap is now five points and Unai Emery's side still have to come to Old Trafford, while Thursday night football is also still on the agenda for them in the Europa League.",
      "Villa are statistical outliers this season when it comes to their data and you can see their results starting to match up with their performance levels at some point.",

      "Manchester United are set to open talks with Kobbie Mainoo over a new contract",
      "Manchester United are set to open contract talks with Kobbie Mainoo and are hopeful of agreeing a deal with the academy graduate before the end of the season. Mainoo has returned to the team under Michael Carrick, starting all three games for the 44-year-old head coach after a spell in the wilderness under Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the 20-year-old shining in the victories against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham, United have made it clear they intend to resume talks over a new long-term contract with Mainoo, with the hope that an agreement can be reached relatively smoothly.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "While United were willing to sanction a loan move in January if Mainoo felt he had to leave to aid his development, Old Trafford sources insist a permanent option was never on the table and they wouldn't have considered any loan that included an option to buy.",
      "But the decision to sack Amorim has changed Mainoo's fortunes and he has quickly rediscovered his best form under Carrick, leading United to inform him and his camp of plans to commence contract talks.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo is still on the contract he signed as a 17-year-old in February 2023 and he is one of the lowest-paid players in the first-team squad. That deal saw the Stockport-born youngster sign terms on a low base rate, as is normal for academy graduates, with significant bonuses for success.",
      "While he was hitting plenty of them during his early time with the squad, he wasn't triggering them when he was benched by Amorim. His return to the team has again led to his salary rising due to the bonuses in his contract.",
      "Mainoo still has a year left on that contract, as well as the option of another year in the club's favour, but United want to tie him down for longer and on terms that better reflect his status. That was difficult to do when he fell out of favour under Amorim, but he has again proved his worth over the last three weeks.",

      "Michael Carrick looks at home at Old Trafford and is putting himself in the frame for a Premier League job next season",
      "Michael Carrick had never previously met Thomas Frank until they sat down together for a chat in front of the Amazon Prime cameras in September, spending more than half an hour discussing their football philosophies and swapping coaching advice.",
      "The meeting at Spurs Lodge was to preview Frank's first Champions League game in charge of Tottenham against Villarreal, but the 52-year-old Dane and the 44-year-old from the north east struck up a bond as they got into the weeds of coaching.",
      "Frank had just swapped Brentford for Tottenham, while Carrick was doing TV work after leaving Middlesbrough last summer. At the time, there seemed to be no immediate prospect of the latter returning to the dugout anytime soon.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But then came the call from a club he can't say no to. Carrick might have grown up near Newcastle and spent two years as a player at Tottenham, but it is Old Trafford that he now calls home, and when Manchester United made contact in January about the prospect of returning as head coach to replace Ruben Amorim, he jumped at the chance.",
      "Carrick signed a contract until the end of the season, but after three wins in his first three games, including victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, he is now the favourite to be in charge next season as well. There is enough football left in this campaign for that to change, but another win on Saturday against Frank's Tottenham will further strengthen his case.",
      "And whatever happens at Old Trafford, the more Premier League games that Carrick wins, the stronger his own case of getting a job in the top flight becomes. Victory against his former club could even open a door back in north London.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Frank has steadied the ship at Tottenham recently, but he remains under pressure. Supporters are unconvinced by his style of play, and although they finished fourth in the league phase of the Champions League, they are 14th in the Premier League.",
      "Defeat at Old Trafford would be unlikely to be terminal, but as things stand, it's hard to see Frank regaining enough credit to survive beyond the end of the season. If Tottenham do pull the trigger, could they turn to Carrick for 2026/27?",
      "That will become a possibility if he continues to be successful at United. Guiding a team that looked flat under Amorim into the Champions League places would look good on Carrick's CV, and it's not beyond the realms of possibility that they could yet catch Aston Villa or Manchester City.",
      "The question for United could become whether they are prepared to let Carrick leave and walk into a different Premier League job. If the football hierarchy at Old Trafford looks elsewhere despite Carrick's success, only for him to then thrive at a different club - such as Tottenham - it could be an awkward look.",
      "For Carrick, there is no doubt where he would rather be. He made 75 appearances for Tottenham and is still popular there, but speaking on Thursday about leaving White Hart Lane for Old Trafford, he made it clear United struck a different chord for him.",
      "\"It was pretty instant,\" he said of his love affair with United. \"I've got really fond memories of Tottenham and being at the club. I was there for a short time, or what feels now like a short time when you look back, but I really enjoyed it. It was a good team, Martin Jol was the manager, and there were a lot of things that I learned at the club in that short period of time.",
      "\"But I've said it enough times. I think coming here was a jump, and a big jump at the time, and I certainly felt that pretty quickly, and then I think once you step inside this place as a footballer, then it kind of turns you. So pretty much from the first day walking into the dressing room, meeting the manager from then on in, that was me.\"",
      "Carrick's near-three-year stint at Middlesbrough had come to a natural end in the summer and he looked in no rush to return to coaching until the offer from United came. In just over three weeks, he has rediscovered a love of being on the grass and working with players.",
      "He has also enhanced his job prospects, and this weekend he could open up another opportunity for himself in the Premier League.",

      "Benjamin Sesko celebrates scoring for Manchester United against Fulham(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's disappointing 2024/25 season meant wholesale changes were guaranteed when the summer transfer window opened. The priority for United was to reshape their forward line. United scored a measly 44 goals in 38 Premier League games and those figures contributed to a 15th-place finish.",
      "Since Ineos' arrival, the priority for United has been to sign players with resale value who could either stay at Old Trafford for most of their career or be sold for a profit. Following this blueprint, the first target of the summer was Ipswich Town's Liam Delap.",
      "Delap was always destined to remain in the Premier League having enjoyed a good season with the Tractor Boys. The Suffolk club may have been relegated back to the Championship at the first time of asking, but Delap's 12 goals in the Premier League showed signs he could make the step up and retain his place in the top flight, even if his team didn't.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He also had the right profile for the attack Ruben Amorim was looking to build: tall and athletic, with the ability to hold the ball up and an eye for goal. A £30m release clause saw United try to persuade him to move to Old Trafford, but in the end Chelsea were seen as a more enticing option and United had to go back to the drawing board.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo joined to strengthen United's attack but the Reds were still missing a focal point at the top of the pitch. Viktor Gyokeres chose Arsenal so with options running out, United turned to Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Younger than both Delap and Gyokeres and without experience of English football, it was a gamble to spend an initial £66m, which could rise to £72m, to bring the forward in. Indeed, it may still be a gamble that doesn't pay off, but there have been signs of promise.",
      "Liam Delap has struggled since joining Chelsea(Image: PA)",
      "Both Delap and Gyokeres have proven to be unwise additions for Chelsea and Arsenal respectively. Delap has struggled with just two goals in 21 appearances for his new club.",
      "Sesko has six in 21. While this is by no means golden boot form either, the Slovenian has at least shown more promise than Delap and has a higher ceiling for improvement.",
      "His goal on Sunday against Fulham could be a huge turning point. Bouncing back from hitting the post shortly after coming on, Sesko showed brilliant composure to win the game for United in stoppage time. He may have cost them £36m more than Delap would have done but in the long-term this could be money well spent.",

Casemiro is the highest earner in the dressing room and his exit will free up money on the wage bill.",

      "United turned down the chance to sign Wilfred Ndidi during the winter transfer window, according to the Nigerian outlet Soccernet.",
      "Ndidi was said to be keen on a move, but the club reportedly gave the proposal short shrift, instead focusing on long-term targets for the summer rather than stop-gap solutions.",
      "Besiktas have asked about the availability of Altay Bayindir, according to TEAMtalk.",
      "The Turkish team have also reportedly approached Filip Jorgensen, Giorgi Mamardashvili, and Illan Meslier to no avail. United will seemingly respond in the same way, given their lack of depth in the goalkeeping department aside from Senne Lammens."

      "Manchester United marked the 68th anniversary of the tragic Munich Air Disaster with a poignant remembrance service on Friday. In the rain, hundreds of supporters paid their respects to those who died.",
      "The remembrance ceremony at Old Trafford on the anniversary of the tragedy has grown each year. United show their class on February 6, and some in the crowd had tears in their eyes.",
      "Reverend John Boyers, former United club chaplain, led proceedings in typically dignified fashion. Boyers was valued by Sir Alex Ferguson, was the chaplain at Gary Neville's wedding and discussed racism with Paul Pogba. Boyers retired eight years ago, but feels it's an honour to still lead the remembrance service.",

      "\"We all gather once more to recall and reflect, we will remember with solemnity those killed in the tragic accident on that slushy Munich runway, on a cold, grey afternoon in 1958,\" said Boyers.",
      "\"Today is a solemn and serious remembrance of that tragic part of Manchester United's history, but we also want to reflect on what followed, and how the club rebuilt itself to achieve European success within 10 years.\"",
      "United boss Michael Carrick attended the service alongside members of his backroom staff, Steve Holland and Jonny Evans. Bruno Fernandes laid a wreath alongside women's team captain Maya Le Tissier.",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO, and Jason Wilcox, director of football, were there to pay their respects. Staff members from each United department attended, along with representatives from the different academy teams.",
      "\"I was here when we played the 50th anniversary of the remembrance, when we wore the special shirts. I think the history of the club is immense, and Munich is part of the footprint that the club has, so it's important to pay respect to the players and staff who didn't survive the crash.\"",
      "Van der Sar knew the importance of the disaster when he was a player. \"I was aware of it, of course. The Manchester boys, like Gary Neville, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, they told us the importance,\" he said.",
      "Journalist Andy Mitten spoke after Rev Boyers' opening remarks. Mitten spoke about unearthing new Munich-related stories, 68 years on, and how Karl-Heinz Rummenigge reflects on the disaster.",
      "\"Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are fantastic at remembering. Let's not forget tiny Bishop Aukland as well,\" he said during his speech. \"Alongside the giants of Red Star Belgrade, Manchester City and Liverpool. But that's enough compliments to those two clubs for this afternoon.\"",
      "Annie Marsh and Harry Oliver Harper, representatives from United's Under-13 teams, bravely stood on stage and read a poem written from Sir Matt Busby's viewpoint. Other youngsters joined the stage during the service. United are conscious of teaching the history of the disaster to future generations.",
      "Sammy McIlroy recalled growing up in Belfast and how he learned about the crash. McIlroy said his schoolteacher \"loved United\" and was \"absolutely heartbroken\" by the disaster.",
      "McIlroy explained that Mr Norman liked to pretend he was Sir Bobby Charlton when they played football at school. Charlton miraculously survived the Munich Air Disaster and was at the heart of United's rebuild.",

      "Martin reflected on his 20th year of singing The Flowers of Manchester at a remembrance service, saying that when he started, it was just him and a microphone, and \"people walking past.\"",

      "The Glazer family are once more attempting to acquire an Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise, with both Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the Rajasthan Royals under consideration. The Glazers already own one T20 team and are now reportedly pursuing considerably larger opportunities.",
      "Avram Glazer is amongst the owners of Manchester United and NFL frachise Tampa Bay Buccaneers, whilst also holding a commercial stake in cricket.",

      "His attempt to secure one of the two IPL expansion franchises, which eventually became Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans, proved unsuccessful back in 2021.",
      "However, the United owners remain determined and are now pursuing both RCB and Rajasthan.",
      "According to State of Play, the Glazers have tabled an offer of approximately $1.8billion (£1.32bn) to purchase Bengaluru, the reigning IPL champions in both the men's and women's formats.",
      "That sum, submitted via New Orleans-based Lancer Capital, positions them amongst the highest bidders from nine competing groups.",
      "They are also contending to acquire Rajasthan, whose sale process is further advanced than Bengaluru's, with a second round imminent. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) regulations prohibit multi-franchise ownership, meaning, should they succeed, the Glazer family may need to select between the two teams.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The Cricket Monthly revealed that the Glazers' proposals for the Ahmedabad and Lucknow franchises in 2021 were the weakest amongst all competing parties. The RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group secured the Lucknow outfit following a bid exceeding £686m, whilst the Titans were acquired by private equity firm CVC Capital Partners for £541m.",
      "The Glazers appear determined not to miss out this time around, with the IPL continuing to flourish commercially as the globe's premier and most profitable T20 competition.",
      "Reports also suggested that Avram Glazer – the family member most enthusiastic about cricket expansion – sought to utilise the Man United brand within the sport. Sheikh Mansoor bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, son of Dubai's ruler, posted on Twitter in March 2022 that he'd met Avram and discuss “the UAE T20 Cricket league's launch in Jan 2023 featuring Manchester United cricket team & other teams.”",
      "That proposal failed to materialise owing to copyright complications, yet the Glazers remain undeterred in their pursuit of cricket opportunities. The IPL venture isn't their sole consideration in India either, with Indian cricket icon Sourav Ganguly disclosing in 2022 that the Glazers had engaged in discussions about acquiring Indian Super League club East Bengal.",
      "The Glazer family have held ownership of United since 2005, but did sell a 26.2 per cent share to Sir Jim Ratcliffe for £1.3bn in February 2024, and the British petrochemicals billionaire now oversees the daily operations of Reds.",

      "Despite such a productive loan spell, United legend Nani still believes Rashford doesn't measure up to one of his Blaugrana team-mates, Lamine Yamal. In a video posted on social media for Goal, Nani was asked to compare some of Europe's leading attackers.",
      "Initially, the Portuguese icon was asked to choose between Barcelona's Yamal and Chelsea prospect Estevao. He selected the former. Next, Rashford and Bukayo Saka were presented to Nani for his judgement. He picked Rashford before making several other choices.",
      "In the following round, it was Rashford alongside team-mate Yamal who were compared. At this point, Nani overlooked the United loanee and said: \"Right now? Lamine Yamal.\" To be fair to Rashford, the 39-year-old went on to select Yamal as his top choice from all the players he was asked about, adding: \"He's my type of player.\"",

      "\"FC Barcelona hereby formally expresses its intention to participate, together with Barcelona City Council and the Government of Catalonia, in the initial bidding process to host the 2029 Champions League Final, proposing the city of Barcelona as a potential host and Spotify Camp Nou as the proposed venue, subject to the corresponding certification and approval by UEFA, and with the support of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF),\" the club said in a statement. \"This process forms part of a preliminary phase of analysis and assessment.",
      "\"The club and the institutions involved have submitted the initial required documentation with the aim of advancing the procedure and enabling UEFA to assess the suitability of the bid, in accordance with the established protocols. The formal submission of the final bid and the delivery of the complete dossier, including all the documentation required to be considered as host of the final, are scheduled for early June 2026.\"",

      "Rashford was part of a Manchester United side beaten 3-0 at Camp Nou in the 2018/19 Champions League. Despite that defeat, the stadium itself left its mark on the Englishman.",
      "\"Atmosphere-wise, I’d probably say I enjoyed Nou Camp,\" Rashford said when asked on The Overlap in 2023 about his favourite stadium. \"The first time we played there we got beat 3-0. We had a couple of chances and I hit the crossbar early on.",
      "\"I think Paul [Pogba] had a shot that clipped the post and this was all at 0-0. Once they got the first goal, the crowd was different. Every time [Lionel] Messi got on the ball it was daunting and the crowd were shouting to make the backline nervous. It was all a mess after they scored the first goal.\"",
      "Rashford played for Manchester United at Camp Nou in 2019(Image: Enric Fontcuberta/EPA-EFE/REX)",
      "Barcelona and Manchester United faced off in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals but haven't met in the competition since that 2019 clash. Camp Nou was also the venue for United's famous 1999 final victory over Bayern Munich - the last time the winners were crowned in Catalunya.",
      "Rashford could soon get the chance not just to play a final at a stadium he admires but to do so as a Barcelona player. That would require Camp Nou to be awarded that 2029 final, while the player himself would need to do enough between now and the end of the season to earn a permanent transfer.",
      "He also set his sights high when moving to the club and was asked about the Champions League after Barca reached the semis last year. A fifth-place finish in the league phase has sent them straight through to the round of 16 where they will meet Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, Newcastle United or Qarabag.",
      "\"It is what the club was fighting for last year and they were very close and I hope they can take the next step this year,\" Rashford said when he joined. \"This is a historic club and they are known for winning the biggest prizes. I am here to help the club do that. It is a dream of mine for sure.\"",
      "The 28-year-old has 10 goals and 13 assists so far during his loan spell, setting up a Ronald Araujo goal during a midweek Copa del Rey win away at Albacete. He was also on target in a victory over Elche on Saturday, earning praise from manager Hansi Flick, with Barca set to make a summer decision on whether to exercise a £26million permanent option for their loanee.",
      "\"I think he has a lot of potential to show,\" Flick said after the Elche win. \"We always focus on goals, the final pass, because this is one of the ways you can measure things, and he’s doing well in that regard.",
      "\"There’s always room for improvement. But with his speed and technique, he can give us so much more. I’m delighted with what he’s giving us, but he has much more potential. I want everyone to be at their best.",
      "\"It’s about mentality, attitude during training… That’s what we want to see. Always striving to be better.\"",

      "Lammens is enjoying an underrated first season.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Senne Lammens was pictured alongside his partner leaving The Ivy in Spinningfields after beating Fulham. The understated Lammens almost looked embarrassed to be photographed by the paparazzi.",
      "Lammens is having an underrated debut season in Manchester. The goalkeeper has brought calm and stability, transmitting confidence when his predecessors had made Old Trafford uneasy.",
      "The 23-year-old made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland in October, and fans celebrated Lammens claiming a cross into the box like a goal. That reaction was a statement from matchgoers, who had become exhausted watching Andre Onana, and then Altay Bayindir.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The bar was low for Lammens to make a strong impression, but the ease with which he's adapted to the Premier League, having come from the Belgian top-flight, has been impressive. There have been times when Lammens should have done better. Danny Welbeck's free-kick for Brighton in October and Kieran Dewsbury's goal for Everton in November were both saveable, but that is nitpicking. There have been no major errors, no blunders that have cost United a game.",
      "Lammens consistently delivers 7/10 performances, with the odd excellent display chucked in for good measure. The Belgian's demeanour has helped him remain unfazed in one of the most scrutinised No.1 roles in the world. He was happy to speak in the mixed zone after the win over Liverpool at Anfield, and he spoke again after the victory at Arsenal. On both occasions, he took the initiative to speak to reporters.",
      "Some players ignore requests for a chat as they leave grounds on matchdays, which is their prerogative, but Lammens has thought 'why not' after two big wins. He seems like a good egg, someone impossible not to get along with.",
      "\"I try to keep my best friends and family close. The rest is a bit like outside noise. It's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it does not go so well, it will be all bad commentary,\" he reflected at Anfield.",
      "The ability to remain level-headed after wins and defeats is a common trait shared by the most successful professionals. Lammens celebrated the Liverpool win by spending the evening with a close friend.",
      "It's been a breath of fresh air to have a reliable goalkeeper between the sticks. Lammens was a data-driven signing, and the data boffins in Michael Sansoni's department will be delighted with his start at United.",
      "Gyoekeres takes a shot against Lammens.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "But United have another goalkeeper on the books who is ready to challenge Lammens. Radek Vitek is enjoying a wonderful season on loan in the Championship, where United send young players who they believe have potential to feature for the first-team.",
      "Vitek is thriving with Bristol City and he made a save of the season contender against Ipswich Town last month, instinctively stretching a hand to tip the ball over the crossbar when he was on the ground.",
      "Vitek's highlights reel will be worth a watch at the end of the campaign. He's produced a handful of top saves, but he's not just stopping shots for the cameras - he's delivering consistently.",
      "United are delighted with how Vitek's loan spell at Ashton Gate is unfolding. He has made 25 starts in the Championship - he missed five games due to a small knee injury - and looks destined for bigger things.",
      "In November, Vitek said: \"It would be a dream to play for Manchester United, but I will take it game by game, and I know there's a big challenge in front of me, but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek delivered a man-of-the-match performance in United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg in 2024, but he didn't join last summer's tour of the United States because he was due to leave on loan.",
      "It would be a surprise if Vitek isn't assessed in pre-season this summer. Lammens has made a superb impact, but Vitek has earned the opportunity to be considered to challenge for the No.1 role.",
      "Vitek is ready for another step up.(Image: 2025 CameraSport)",
      "How United's goalkeeper situation will develop remains to be seen. Vitek would be a superb second choice and great competition for Lammens, but would a talented 22-year-old settle for a No.2 role? It seems unlikely. Vitek will be hungry to play every week after such a successful loan spell.",
      "He's had previous loan spells with Accrington Stanley and FC Blau-Weiß Linz, so it would be a shock for him to be happy to play in cup competitions for United, with a view to challenging Lammens.",
      "The Czech knows what it's like to fight for points each week and won't be short of interest from Europe in the summer. He will feel he can succeed elsewhere if he's seen a No.2 in Manchester.",
      "\"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them,\" Vitek said a few months ago.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek's challenge for the No.1 role may be short-lived, but United are in a strong position with their goalkeeper choice this summer. That couldn't be said at the start of last summer with Onana and Bayindir.",

      "United had a quiet transfer window.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Never say never,\" Michael Carrick said when asked if Manchester United could complete any deals on transfer deadline day. January is usually a quiet month at Old Trafford - and not much has gone on again.",
      "United have not made a signing and there have been no departures from the first-team squad. The most exciting United-related transfer story, interest in Antoine Semenyo, was effectively put to bed before the window opened.",
      "The £62.5million needed to release Semenyo from his Bournemouth contract was bound to be met and Manchester City won the race for his signature. Semenyo ticked a lot of boxes at United and would have been a great addition, but the club did not react by turning to alternatives that weren't quite right.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The message from United sources after missing out on Semenyo was consistent: United were unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets were not expected to be available in the winter window. That's not what fans have wanted to hear, though.",
      "Semenyo has scored four goals in five games for City. He is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League and would have provided a huge boost in the pursuit of Champions League football.",
      "Carrick has made a dream start to his interim role, winning three games on the bounce, a run that has seen United climb to fourth. The Reds are just 12 points adrift of Arsenal, despite the possibility of being dragged into the bottom half being touted in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure.",
      "Amorim's sacking did not change much regarding transfers in the window. United had a plan and they have stuck by it. They have not acted because long-term targets were not available.",
      "Semenyo was on the losing side at Old Trafford two weeks ago.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Carrick revealed at a press conference that he would be consulted on summer plans, though. When asked whether his opinion would be sought on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, Carrick said: \"I'm certainly in this position to do that. And as I said, I think, making decisions for the club moving forward, whatever that may be, I'm fully committed to that.",
      "\"Naturally, as a midfielder, then there's a big tendency towards that anyway, but taking that away from it and now being where I am in the position I am, certainly would be part of those conversations and moving forward because it's important when we get the next steps right in terms of moving forward as a team and there's a squad and putting the right things in place. So yeah, I'll be part of that in the right way.\"",
      "Casemiro announcing that he would leave at the end of the season has been one of the biggest headlines. The Brazilian wanted to avoid speculation about his future during the remainder of the season, and his representatives can engage with potential suitors now that confirmation is out.",
      "The announcement was classy, befitting of a player who has enjoyed a magnificent career, and Casemiro will try to bow out by steering the club back into the Champions League.",
      "United splashed £215million in the summer window and were not in a position to sign a Casemiro replacement, who could cost in the region of £100million, in the winter window.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all admired by United, but they will not be prised away cheaply from their respective clubs. It will be fascinating to see how the summer window unfolds.",
      "Although Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were marked down for possible loan exits, they will continue to contribute at United for the remainder of the season. Mainoo's situation has improved since Carrick's appointment. The youngster was hopeful of leaving on loan before Amorim was sacked.",
      "Roma were interested in signing Zirkzee, but United did not seriously entertain their enquiry. \"United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago, and they have not changed their minds,\" said Roma's football director.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was ready to travel to Turkey on deadline day, but the plug was pulled on his move to the Super Lig by Jason Wilcox, who decided Malacia was needed at United after Patrick Dorgu's injury.",
      "Wilcox told Malacia on Monday morning that he would be needed as part of the first-team squad for the rest of the season. The Dutchman will be frustrated at missing out on a move away again.",
      "Casemiro scored against Fulham on Sunday.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "The MEN were the first to report Rhys Bennett's move to Fleetwood Town, while Joe Hugill is the only other academy export to have left the club on a permanent transfer in the window.",
      "United have banked nominal fees for Mather, Bennett and Hugill, but the club have started to insist on inserting sell-on clauses to benefit from future success. The challenge for Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is to start obtaining higher transfer fees for youngsters when they leave.",
      "Torpey has overseen the club's loan deals since Jonny Evans stepped back from his role as head of loans and pathways in December. Sources with knowledge of the situation indicated the pace of the role was too slow for Evans.",
      "There were loan departures confirmed on deadline day. Ethan Wheatley's move to Bradford City was formally announced, while James Scanlon and Jacob Devaney joined Swindon Town and St. Mirren respectively for their first taste of senior football.",
      "There is no rush to confirm Sekou Kone's move to Lausanne-Sport because the Swiss transfer window shuts on February 15 - the expectation is that Kone will stay with Lausanne-Sport for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Academy transfer activity was as exciting as it got in the final hours of the window.",

      "Ronaldo, who celebrates his 41st birthday on Thursday, declined to feature for Al-Nassr in their 1-0 win against Al-Riyadh on Monday after becoming incensed by Karim Benzema's transfer to title challengers Al-Hilal. Benzema, Ronaldo's former Real Madrid colleague, had his Al-Ittihad deal cancelled before securing a free transfer to Al-Hilal, who sit one point clear of Al-Nassr at the top of the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The Public Investment Fund (PIF) owns all three sides, and Ronaldo is frustrated that the transfer was approved, believing the acquisition of the French forward has unfairly strengthened Al-Hilal's championship challenge. The circumstances have triggered questions about whether Ronaldo will complete the remaining 18 months of his £488,000-per-day agreement with Al-Nassr.",
      "Could the five-time Ballon d'Or recipient make a remarkable third return to Manchester United? Not according to his former colleague, Wes Brown, who told BettingLounge: \"He's not happy, but would Cristiano Ronaldo come back to Manchester United for a third go? I would say no.

It's a shock to everyone to see Ronaldo on strike, but I honestly think it will get resolved. We'll have to wait and see where it goes from here.\"",
      "Neither Ronaldo nor any of his teammates and coaching staff have issued public statements following Monday's victory. Head coach Jorge Jesus had his post-match press conference cancelled, with the squad told not to engage with journalists.",

United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",

      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has issued a transfer ‘ultimatum’ to Al Nassr chiefs as his boycott continues.",
      "Ronaldo joined Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr at the start of 2023 on a free transfer. This move followed the mutual termination of his Man Utd contract at the end of 2022.",
      "The 40-year-old has 111 goals in his 127 appearances for Al Nassr in all competitions, but there have been reports of his unhappiness over the past year.",
      "Ahead of the expiry of his contract last year, it was reported that Ronaldo was not satisfied at Al Nassr following the failure to win the Saudi Pro League and/or the AFC Champions League and could join Al-Hilal or another Club World Cup team.",
      "Ronaldo eventually opted to pen a contract extension with Al Nassr, but he is currently on strike after reportedly taking issue with the board’s alleged lack of backing in the transfer market.",

      "On Thursday evening, a spokesperson for the Saudi Pro League commented on the ongoing Ronaldo situation.",
      "“The Saudi Pro League is structured around a simple principle: every club operates independently under the same rules,” a league spokesperson said.",
      "“Clubs have their own boards, their own executives and their own football leadership. Decisions on recruitment, spending and strategy sit with those clubs, within a financial framework designed to ensure sustainability and competitive balance. That framework applies equally across the league.",
      "“Cristiano has been fully engaged with Al Nassr since his arrival and has played an important role in the club’s growth and ambition. Like any elite competitor, he wants to win. But no individual – however significant – determines decisions beyond their own club.",
      "“Recent transfer activity demonstrates that independence clearly. One club strengthened in a particular way. Another chose a different approach. Those were club decisions, taken within approved financial parameters.",
      "“The competitiveness of the league speaks for itself. With only a few points separating the top four, the title race is very much alive. That level of balance reflects a system that is working as intended.",
      "“The focus remains on football – on the pitch, where it belongs – and on maintaining a credible, competitive competition for players and fans.”",
      "Now, a report from talkSPORT claims Ronaldo has issued a transfer ‘ultimatum’ to Al Nassr as he is ‘prepared to leave’ if his situation does not improve.",
      "It is also noted that he could move to Turkey in the summer.",
      "The report claims: ‘Ronaldo’s Al Nassr contract includes a €50m release clause and talkSPORT understands Turkish clubs are monitoring the situation ahead of the summer.",
      "‘It is not thought Ronaldo will boycott games indefinitely, knowing his absence is detrimental to Al Nassr’s title chances and lack of game time in a World Cup year is also not ideal. However, his decision to sit out matches is supported by the club’s board.’",

      "Tim Sherwood has urged Manchester United not to “miss the boat” for a third time and fight Liverpool for Micky van de Ven.",
      "Van de Ven has been a key player for Spurs since joining in 2023 for £35m, with his performances catching the eye of Liverpool, who are thought to be considering a move for the Dutchman as a long-term replacement for compatriot Virgil van Dijk.",
      "The Reds have completed the £60m signing of young French defender Jeremy Jacquet, who will join up with the squad at the end of the season, but with Ibrahima Konate set to leave in the summer when his contract expires, Arne Slot’s side are likely to still be in the market for further defensive additions.",
      "Van de Ven is under contract at Spurs until 2029, which has emboldened the north London club to slap a £100m price tag on his head to ward off suitors.",
      "But Sherwood believes the Red Devils should still battle Liverpool for his signature after regretting “missing the boat” with Declan Rice and Harry Kane, who moved to Arsenal and Bayern Munch respectively despite keen interest from United.",
      "“If he proves his fitness, I think there will be a queue around the block for himm,” Sherwood told CasinoStugan.",
      "“Hopefully Tottenham can keep hold of him but you know what it’s like when a player decides he wants to leave. Unfortunately, if you don’t let him go, you’re left without the money and the player in the end.",
      "“People may be shocked by that but it all depends on who they have as manager in the summer because they’ve got it wrong so many times before and it looks like they have got it right at the moment.”",
      "Sherwood continued: “United are a club that can go from where they have been to the top quicker than most because they’ve got the brand power, the money to do it. They can pay the big wages for the big players.",
      "“They missed the boat before. They could have signed Declan Rice and Harry Kane. Instead, they ended up with seven or eight signings who were alright but mostly very poor.",
      "“They won’t want to miss the boat this time on Van de Ven. He will certainly be at the top of a lot of lists at any number of clubs and Tottenham will have to fight tooth and nail to keep hold of him.",
      "“I think the only real way they keep hold of him is if Micky decides that there might be a bright future ahead at Tottenham, and right now they’re down in 14th in the Premier League and out of the running for the two domestic cups. They’re flying high in the Champions League but there are stiffer tests to come in that competition.”",

      "Speaking last month on speculation surrounding Van de Ven, Spurs boss Thomas Frank said: “He’s very important for us, so Micky’s a Tottenham player now and for the future.",
      "“Micky’s an excellent player; he’s a fantastic ambassador for this club.",
      "“He’s having potentially his best season so far. He’s fit, he’s strong, good defensively, he’s growing as a leader, scoring goals as well, and he’s a very important player for us this season and for the future.”",

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘open the door’ for Leny Yoro to leave the club as Real Madrid reignite their interest in the centre-back, who already has a ‘verbal agreement’ in place to leave Old Trafford for the Spanish giants.",
      "Yoro joined the Red Devils from Lille for £52m in the summer of 2024 as Los Blancos backed away from their own negotiations with the young defender as they couldn’t match the fee offered by the Premier League side.",
      "Reports suggested Yoro preferred a move to the Bernabeu at the time, and he may now get his wish as a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims his name ‘once again sneaks into Real Madrid’s sports planning’.",
      "Madrid now believe that Yoro is ‘a more mature player prepared to assume immediate responsibilities’ after his time at Old Trafford, despite what many will have seen as an up and down spell at best in England.",
      "Yoro has now made 56 appearances for United, but was in and out of the team under Ruben Amorim and now firmly out of it after Michael Carrick took the interim reins.",
      "The 22-year-old has played just one minute of the Red Devils’ three games under Carrick and doesn’t look set to force his way back in anytime soon given they’ve won all three of those games, against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "Carrick’s move to four at the back with just two centre-backs rather than the three deployed by Amorim will make game time far harder to come by for Yoro, who has watched Lisandro Martinez and Harry Maguire excel in those roles in the last three games.",
      "The report claims that while United have not ‘officially declared Yoro as transferable’, they will ‘open the door to an exit’ if Madrid are willing to make a bid of around €70m [£61m], in what would be a remarkable profit-making coup for the Premier League giants.",
      "Madrid may not need to pay that much as a report just after Yoro signed for United claimed they came to a ‘verbal agreement’ with the Red Devils that the defender could leave the club within two years for the Spanish club.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Real Madrid has reached, not officially, but through some intermediaries, that Leny Yoro has a verbal agreement with Manchester United, something that is not signed, but consensual in word of mouth, for which the French player will be able to sign for the merengue team within two seasons.",
      "‘This possibility could be realized if the white club is interested in him again and the soccer player is not happy in Manchester, as long as a price similar to the one the English have paid now, about 50-55 million euros is paid.’",
      "It’s thought such a sale would be welcomed by Untied as it ‘would make it possible to balance accounts and reorder a squad that is still in the process of being rebuilt’, with the report adding that Yoro himself ‘would not look against a change of scenery if the sports proposal is convincing’.",
      "Maguire’s future remains up in the air as his contract is up at the end of the season, meaning Yoro may just need to be patient to force his way into the United team, but Matthijs de Ligt will provide further competition when he returns to fitness, as will fellow young defender Ayden Heaven, who’s impressed when called upon this season.",
      "Carrick added former centre-backs Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate to his coaching staff when he took on his interim role, and Maguire believes they will both be offer invaluable guidance to the young defenders in the United squad.",
      "“He was a fantastic player. Coaching [here], he’s come in and been refreshing. He brings great energy to the group, to the sessions”, Maguire admitted about Woodgate.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a centre-back himself, and he’s giving me tips, and he’s definitely going to work a lot with the younger centre-backs, with Leny [Yoro], Ayden [Heaven], and Tyler [Fredricson].",
      "“But, of course, even senior players like myself and Licha [Lisandro Martinez], we can learn from him. He’s brought great ideas, and I’ve been really impressed.”",

      "On Evans, Maguire added: “Jonny is great to have around. The way that he handles himself and the responsibility that he took on his shoulders when he was a player, he can take that on to coaching as well.",
      "“Just little things like in the session the other day, I was finished and was walking in and could see that Jonny was doing extra work with Leny and Ayden. Things like that, as a young boy coming through and playing on the biggest stage, sometimes you have to learn and adapt on the pitch and on the stage, but you also can’t forget that you need to improve and you need to work.",
      "“These are young, talented centre-backs and to have Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans coaching them now and giving them little tips, it’s fantastic for them.”",

      "You’d better believe it’s a big weekend, kicking off with the inevitable bringer-of-chaos that is Man United v Spurs and then finishing with the enticing possibilities of what Liverpool and Man City might conjure up at Anfield.",
      "And there’s plenty of good stuff in between and around the country and indeed continent.",
      "We’re really looking forward to this one.",
      "",
      "Who said Liverpool wouldn’t be involved in the title race? They can be front and centre here in confirming there will not in fact be a title race at all.",
      "We make it now five times Arsenal have been confirmed as champions and six times the title race has been declared back on, but it really would be hard to see how we get anything other than Arsenal ending all those years of hurt if this weekend goes wrong for City.",
      "With Arsenal slumming it in a Saturday 3pm slot for the second weekend in a row, by the time City arrive at Anfield for Super Sunday’s headliner they could be staring at a nine-point deficit and firmly in must-win territory.",
      "That’s not ideal when you’re going to Anfield and in your last away game you failed to win from 2-0 up against a team who at the time had fewer home points than anyone bar Wolves and had almost entirely run out of available adult footballers.",
      "City got themselves back on track a bit with a Carabao paddling of Newcastle in the second leg of their semi-final, but you’d imagine they are at least a little bit trying to work out what happened in that second half at Spurs.",
      "The concession of two goals was bad, of course, but in many ways more troubling was the fact that as things got so very far away from a team that had been in such effortless first-half control, Erling Haaland and co. managed not one second-half attempt on target against a defence of Archie Gray, Joao Palhinha, Radu Dragusin and Destiny Udogie. Or put another way, a Tottenham defence that has struggled all season was able to repel City’s advances with its third-choice right-back and fourth and fifth-choice centre-backs.",
      "It’s not a great look for City. Or for Newcastle’s defence in the first half of that Carabao clash, now we think of it.",
      "Liverpool may not have title deeds to think of for themselves this weekend, but they do still have plenty to think about having found themselves embroiled in what will likely but not definitely distil into a three-into-two Champions League squabble with Chelsea and Man United for fourth and fifth.",
      "And Liverpool are already the ones on the outside looking in knowing those two can both increase that gap on Saturday. And both are up against relegation stragglers, with Chelsea travelling to Wolves and United hosting Spurs.",
      "",
      "Which brings us neatly to our team to watch. Although frankly it’s both of them, because Man United v Spurs is a lovely little Saturday lunchtime treat for us all.",
      "Spurs against A Manchester Club is about as close to a guarantee of nonsense as the Premier League can provide. The game against City last weekend delivered in grand style, and there’s no reason to think this one won’t do likewise.",
      "United themselves remain pleasingly absurd even when in good form, so long may that continue. They have developed a particular habit this year for late twists. Emphasis on plural. There are few more extreme emotions in football than joy and relief following hot on the heels of despair, and United have perfected the art this season.",
      "Their last two games have been 3-2 wins in which they’ve conceded a late equaliser then scored an even later winner, something they also did this season at Anfield, while in the reverse fixture at Spurs they were ahead at 83 minutes, behind at 91 and level at 96.",
      "Michael Carrick has them on a three-game winning run that has prompted inevitable chatter about his interim role becoming a permanent one, because there’s no way promoting an under-qualified club legend in such fashion could ever backfire.",
      "But this is in many ways his biggest test, because he’s up against a team so stupid. More stupid even than his own. He’s beaten the two best teams in the country and in Fulham an extremely competent one. He has therefore yet to face a challenge like Spurs, a team who City can once again attest are impossible to get your head around, and who United haven’t beaten in the last nine attempts. Including, of course, United suffering just about the most embarrassing fate it’s possible for a professional football team to suffer by contriving to lose to Spurs in an actual final.",
      "Luckily for United and everyone, Spurs have already ensured they will not be using that trophy win as any kind of launchpad. That’s not the way they do things, and we’re already just a Champions League last-16 exit away from confirming year one of the next decade-plus trophy drought, one in which simply remaining in the Premier League might become a stretch target.",
      "But for now what Spurs do still have is some kind of bizarre hold over the Manchester clubs, and one that United could really do with putting right this weekend. For football reasons, with Champions League qualification very much in sight, but perhaps just as importantly for their own sanity.",
      "",
      "Brentford have been the Premier League’s surprise package this year, with a widely predicted relegation fight having never remotely materialised in a season that has instead turned into an unlikely tilt at Europe under rookie boss Keith Andrews.",
      "A large part of that has been the spectacular way Igor Thiago has emerged from the shadows of the now departed Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa to score seven more Premier League goals this season than that pair combined.",
      "With Haaland having endured one of his oddly familiar mid-season slumps in front of goal, Thiago still retains genuine hope of being crowned the least likely Golden Boot winner for many a year, trailing by just four and seemingly facing Newcastle at a very good time here.",
      "Two of his 16 Premier League goals this season came in the 3-1 win over Wissa’s new team back in November, and Newcastle hit this return fixture at a low ebb.",
      "Since a three-game winning run in the Premier League at the turn of the year appeared to have turned them back into European contenders, it’s all gone wrong again. Newcastle’s only wins in eight games since have been against PSV in the Champions League and Bournemouth on penalties after a wild 3-3 draw in the FA Cup.",
      "Even in that winning run they also conceded three goals to Leeds. Aston Villa and City have both beaten them 2-0 at St James’ Park in recent weeks, and in the last week alone Newcastle have conceded seven goals in two games at Liverpool and City.",
      "Eddie Howe is coming under pressure and could really do without the sight of the Premier League’s second-best striker right about now.",
      "",
      "We already know this will be Glasner’s last time managing Palace in the not-local-but-very-real Brighton derby; what’s less clear is how many more games he’ll be in charge of Palace altogether.",
      "It does all feel rather futile trying to sustain this visibly, grumpily broken marriage through to the summer, especially while every game for which the relationship continues Palace tumble closer and closer to mortal peril.",
      "They probably won’t go down, but it would be nice to be able to say it with any kind of confidence about a team that has simply stopped winning football matches altogether as the infighting takes over.",
      "Even Palace’s fellow relegation-tumblers Spurs are managing to kick the sh*t out of some ragtag collections of poor old German farmers every now and then. Palace didn’t even beat KuPS, who look more like the first four characters of a helpfully memorable 20-character wifi password than a football team.",
      "That final Conference League game was back before Christmas, and was the second of what is now a 12-match run in all competitions in which all manner of almost pathetically easy chances to win have been knocked back.",
      "Sixth-tier side in the FA Cup? No thank you. Dr Tottenham? Honestly, we’re fine. Nottingham Forest down to 10 for the whole second half? We won’t even bother having a shot.",
      "After Brighton, Palace’s next four games are against Burnley and Wolves in the Premier League and the two legs of their Conference punishment-round tie against Zrinjski Mostar. So Glasner and the lads don’t necessarily have to get that long-awaited win in this weekend’s formbook-out-the-window caper. But if they still don’t have one a couple of weeks from now, then things are very bad indeed.",
      "",
      "One of those fixtures that feels a lot more Barclays than it is. There’s a powerful Premier League energy here that just confirms how potent early experience can be, because there have in fact only been five Premier League seasons featuring both Norwich and Blackburn, only two of them in this century and none in the last decade.",
      "But never mind that. Yer da will say that these are proper teams because their first three Premier League seasons together were the first three seasons of the Premier League – the Premiership glory days. These are the sorts of teams who if they do find themselves in the second tier will be managed by someone like Steve Bruce and he will describe them as “Premier League teams in all but name”.",
      "Except right now they absolutely are not. They are much closer to being League One teams in actual name, and this is another huge six-pointer in a Championship relegation scrap that has developed a strikingly Premier League Years look to it.",
      "Leicester’s six-point punishment this week leaves us with West Brom, Blackburn, Leicester, Portsmouth and Norwich all either in the relegation zone or within a point of it approaching the finishing straight.",
      "",
      "PSG have won their last six Ligue 1 games but haven’t yet seen off the dogged challenge of Lens, who sit just two points back, and know they can’t afford to slip up against arch-rivals Marseille.",
      "They may still be reeling from the astonishing way they were bounced out of the Champions League via their own shambolic 3-0 defeat at Club Brugge and Benfica’s injury-time goalkeeper nonsense against Real Madrid, but a second win of the season over PSG would get them back on the fringes of the title race and certainly help lift that slightly darkening mood.",
      "If that’s unlikely, then Marseille’s minds should certainly be focused by ensuring they get another chance at the Champions League next season, with a resurgent Lyon now level on points in what looks like a direct fight for the third and final spot.",
      "",
      "The newly crowned world champions Arsenal are not going to win the WSL this year even if they do manage to slow City’s charge slightly this weekend.",
      "But it’s still a vital game in what has become an intriguing battle for the minor places and the chance, in Arsenal’s case, of a further tilt at glory on the continent and beyond.",
      "City are away and clear over the horizon having won 13 of their 14 games this season, but just two points separate Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs in the fight for Champions League qualification.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "To celebrate National 80s Day – it’s a thing, apparently – test your knowledge of football through the decade. Or ask your dad…",
      "Sandro Tonali ignored journalists in the mixed zone TWICE – so can only possibly be leaving Newcastle after being ‘courted by’ close friend Pep Guardiola.",
      "The Newcastle fan sentiment towards Eddie Howe has turned: he has done a phenomenal job but no longer is he the definitive best man for it. Is Jesse Marsch?",

      "Manchester United have made a bold attempt to ‘convince’ Luis Enrique to snub Paris Saint-German and become their new manager as a ‘reliable source’ details a crunch ‘meeting in Paris’.",
      "Michael Carrick is off to an excellent start as caretaker boss of the Red Devils, winning all of his first three games, including the scalps of Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "The uptick in results and performances post-Ruben Amorim has led to suggestions the former United midfielder may be handed the reins on a permanent basis, but that hasn’t stopped club chiefs from tapping up one of the best in the business, according to a report late on Thursday night.",
      "Their attempt to lure Enrique to Old Trafford comes amid reports last week that the Spaniard has rejected offers of a new contract at PSG as he seeks a new challenge, though the 55-year-old boss moved to quickly dismiss those claims as “fake news”.",
      "The former Barcelona manager said: “These are rumours that always circulate at PSG.",
      "“We are used to them, they are private matters and will remain so. There is a lot of ‘fake news’ and they will not destabilise either the players or the team.",
      "“It’s normal to have talks, but they remain private. We know what we want, and that’s the most important thing. We are calm and relaxed.”",
      "X account Indykaila, run by a team of 5 elite reporters, claim United may have had something to do with those rumours after reportedly meeting with Enqrique’s representatives in Paris in a bid to ‘convince’ him to snub that latest contract offer.",
      "They wrote on X: ‘Exclusive. A reliable source from France has told us that Manchester United officials met with agent Iván de la Peña from the agency De la Peña & Sostres, who manages Luis Enrique. The meeting took place in Paris last week. They tried to convince Luis Enrique to reject PSG’s new contract offer.’",

      "Match of the Day pundit Danny Murphy recently told Boyle Sports why he believes the job at United may appeal to the Spanish coach.",
      "He said: “If there’s an opportunity to get Luis Enrique, absolutely Manchester United have to go for it. He’s a top coach, plays the right way, is really attack-minded, and demands a lot from his players.",
      "“He’d need a revamp of the squad to play the way he does with the PSG team, but he’s obviously one of the best coaches out there. So, yes, if there’s even a one percent chance he won’t sign a new deal, jump on it and try to get him.",
      "“The appeal of United is still there for any top manager. They are one of the biggest clubs in the world, and if you can be the man to get them back on top and competing again, you’re going to be idolised.",
      "“I think that’s a challenge someone like Enrique would relish. Thomas Tuchel, even, is another top coach who is supposed to finish after the World Cup.",
      "“Maybe Tuchel is a bit more confrontational, willing to speak his mind and go against the grain at the clubs he’s been at, so that might be off-putting for the hierarchy at Manchester United, whereas Enrique seems to get on with it. But yes, there’s not a United fan anywhere that wouldn’t be delighted with Enrique.”",
      "Luis Enrique’s lack of Premier League experience is likely to count against him as Man Utd look to decide their next permanent boss, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United-linked Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Enrique is on Real Madrid’s shortlist after they sacked Xabi Alonso, according to reports.",
      "It has been claimed that Xabi Alonso “would not choose” Chelsea over other Premier League clubs after Luis Enrique opted to reject the Blues.",
      "Would ‘main target’ Luis Enrique say yes to Manchester United? Probably not, but this could be the XI he would pick if he did replace Michael Carrick…",
      "Man Utd have identified Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique as one of four leading candidates to succeed Ruben Amorim permanently, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique has emerged as the ‘favourite’ to be Ruben Amorim’s permanent replacement at Manchester United."

      "It’s Manchester United v Tottenham this weekend and that makes us very excited.",
      "The reason isn’t complicated; it’s because it’s almost guaranteed to be absurd but even more importantly with absolutely no guarantee about which specific way(s) it will be absurd.",
      "That’s the real fun. It will be ridiculous, sure, but not one of us can possibly know exactly how it will be ridiculous.",
      "Only a certified idiot would attempt to predict what would happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "Here then are our predictions for what will happen in this latest clash between the two stupidest big Premier League clubs over the last couple of years.",
      "",
      "Emphasis very much on the multiple here. That’s the key to this bit. Obviously every team has games that feature late drama. It is an integral part of the game for everyone, for both good and bad.",
      "Nobody goes through a season without at least a bit of late drama.",
      "What we have here, though, are two teams whose penchant for the ridiculous often extends to the best kind of late drama, where one late sucker punch is followed by another even later sucker punch, increasingly the comedy levels of the whole thing.",
      "The reverse fixture between these two earlier in the season was a classic of the genre. United were leading until Spurs equalised in the 84th minute and then went ahead through Richarlison in stoppage time.",
      "Cue a typical quiet and restrained Richarlison celebration and further proof that the Brazilian taking his shirt off is one of the most reliable harbingers of doom this universe has yet devised.",
      "After Spurs went ahead in the first added minute, United equalised in the last, leaving neither side remotely sure whether or not they should be happy about what they’d won or annoyed at what they’d spaffed away. Which for us is the perfect outcome to any football match.",
      "FUN FACT: This match took place just 90 days ago and a now relegation-fearing Spurs were 30 seconds away from going SECOND IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE TABLE.",
      "But while it’s a wonderfully pure example, as you’d expect from a game featuring both these idiots, it is far from a rogue outlier in either side’s season.",
      "Just last week, United lost and regained the lead against Fulham in stoppage-time. At Arsenal they responded to an 84th-minute equaliser with an absurd winner three minutes later. In their other big cathartic win over a historical rival in Liverpool the timings were slightly earlier but still valid, with Liverpool’s 78th-minute leveller countered by Harry Maguire’s giant cheat-code of a head six minutes later.",
      "In a wild 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in December, United trailed after 76 minutes and led after 79 before being pegged back again.",
      "In addition to the United game, Spurs have this season managed to fall behind twice and hit back twice all within the final 20 minutes of a 2-2 draw at Newcastle, and experienced the absurd delights of watching Joao Palhinha score his second overhead kick of the season (more on that later) to drag them level at Bournemouth only for Antoine Semenyo to score a winner with his last kick before joining Man City, for whom he would inevitably also score against Spurs a few short weeks later.",
      "Spurs have drawn 2-2 against PSG in a game they led 2-0 with five minutes remaining, and have drawn three games in which they have trailed 2-0 (Brighton, Bodo/Glimt, Man City).",
      "Three of Tottenham’s last four Premier League games have featured result-altering stoppage-time goals, and the one that didn’t contained one of the least likely comebacks from 2-0 down you could possibly imagine.",
      "And let’s not forget either that these two teams also had a 4-3 caper in last season’s Carabao in which a 3-0 Spurs lead was cut to 3-2 before Son Heung-min scored direct from a corner with two minutes to go, which still left time enough for Jonny Evans to score United’s third and keep Spurs honest in the closing seconds.",
      "",
      "United have scored some very good goals this season, with Matheus Cunha at Arsenal a fine recent example. But this category has surely been more of a Spurs speciality and does feel particularly on-brand.",
      "What we like best about the sheer number of genuinely ridiculous goals Spurs have scored this season is that they’ve had these frequent oases of genius and/or ridiculousness dotted around in a barren wasteland of what is unanimously agreed to be some of the worst and most joyless, uninspired and uninspiring attacking play this or any other club has ever produced. It is genuinely unwatchable at times yet very occasionally utterly unmissable at others.",
      "Spurs have so far this season scored: four overhead kicks (one of them by a centre-back – an equaliser deep into stoppage-time, naturally – and two from a workhorse, tackle-loving defensive midfielder), a box-to-box individual effort sure to get a Puskas nomination (also scored by a centre-back, but a different one), a completely pointless goal from 45 yards out in the middle of what otherwise appeared to be some kind of anti-football dirty protest of a performance in a humbling at Arsenal, and a scorpion kick to provide what was, in multiple ways, the single most unlikely equalising goal on record.",
      "So we will accept nothing less here than Destiny Udogie running the length of Old Trafford before scoring an overhead rabona from 37 yards. In the 98th minute. Before Bruno Fernandes scores a penalty in the 101st.",
      "",
      "Not, admittedly, a novel idea. But surely never a stronger claim than now.",
      "We make no apologies for the fact Romero is one of our absolute favourites. There’s always something about any player who combines genuine elite talent with what at times borders on a kind of actual madness.",
      "It also means he is often unfairly punished because there are few players more conspicuously preceded by their reputation, but never mind that now because on this occasion it helps us because we are actively predicting it.",
      "Romero is an emotional sort, prone to head-loss and at all times capable of losing the entire run of himself. It can happen at any time.",
      "But consider the current state of things and it’s easy to see why this is a perfect storm of a game.",
      "First of all, Romero can go rogue at any moment but does tend to preserve his red-card shenanigans for the biggest games. His three Premier League red cards have come against Manchester City, Chelsea and this season against Liverpool. His other two Tottenham red cards have been against Milan in the Champions League and, well, Vitesse Arnhem in the Conference League so forget about that last one.",
      "Four out of five in all and three out of three in the Barclays is still a trend, okay. Shut up.",
      "There is also his current frame of mind to consider. We’ve all seen the switch flick in games with Romero and realised what might come next. “Oh, he’s ticking,” Gary Neville will caution on co-commentary with all the faux-concern of David Brent fearing a September wedding could be a washout.",
      "Romero is going to start this game already ticking loudly after lashing out and going in two-footed, studs-ablaze on the Spurs suits after a deadline day squib.",
      "He’s also been ill, which restricted him to 45 lethargic and painful minutes against City last weekend, and none of us is at our best mentally or emotionally when we’re poorly, are we?",
      "It all has us wondering what’s the earliest in a game anyone has suffered the ‘save him from himself’ pre-red-card substitution? Because it could happen in the warm-up here.",
      "",
      "Okay, so a bit cake-and-eat-it this one, but what we’re saying here is that it’s not going to be like 1-1 or 2-1. It’s either going to have all of the goals or none.",
      "United’s last two Premier League games have been 3-2 wins and Spurs’ last two Premier League games have been 2-2 draws so we’re very hopeful it’s the former. Spurs have conceded at least twice in their last five games against Premier League opposition (one of those was Villa in the FA Cup)",
      "For Man United, it’s four of the last five (again including a 2-1 home FA Cup defeat, in this case against Brighton).",
      "Both clubs’ runs include conceding twice against Burnley, who have only managed to score twice in eight Premier League games this season. For added fun, one of the other six was also against Man United in one of what are now the Red Devils’ trademark 3-2 wins.",
      "We also of course have the 2-2 draw between these two sides from earlier in the season, as well as that 4-3 Carabao caper last season.",
      "But we must also prepare ourselves for the fact that these two sides are also capable of taking a game that appears to offer a near guarantee of goals – and also brilliant ones – yet instead provide none of that.",
      "The Europa League final remains one of the funniest things ever to happen because imagine losing to Tottenham in an actual final, but it was also one of the most wretched football matches ever staged in which Spurs scored the scrappiest imaginable version of their favourite goal under Ange – cross from the left, converted from close range by Brennan Johnson – and then defended for their lives against a United side with absolutely no idea how or what to do to prevent the banter apocalypse about to befall them.",
      "And you might say well that was such a high-stakes game for both sides it was bound to happen. But Spurs also beat United 1-0 in a crap league game last year where an early James Maddison goal was enough.",
      "Spurs famously beat United four times last season, and United failed to score in three of those games. Remember, this was a Spurs team being managed by Ange Postecoglou, a man who considered the entire concept of ‘defending’ to be an act of craven cowardice that bordered on cheating.",
      "Goals appear so inevitable here that, sure, it might be 4-4 after one team is 4-0 up after 17 minutes. But it’s also just possible these two teams are capable of stupidity that cancels the other’s out so entirely that it instead ends up the worst 0-0 draw you’ve ever seen.",
      "",
      "The boldest shout, because Spurs these days specialise in beating teams from daft little farmers’ leagues from unlikely-sounding countries such as ‘Germany’, while losing to pretty any proper (i.e. English) team.",
      "But there are a few reasons to suspect it could happen here. Firstly, a Spurs win is funnier than a Man United win and that is a powerful force in the universe.",
      "Spurs have also just emerged from a five-game Premier League run against Brentford, Sunderland, Bournemouth, West Ham and Burnley in which they took only three points and no wins. It’s vital and inevitable they outperform that pathetic return against mainly bad sides in the run of five games against mainly good sides currently underway against City, United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "A win at Old Trafford to clinch it just two games in would be powerfully Spurs and enormously United.",
      "There is also the perplexing fact that these days United don’t ever actually beat Spurs. We all know the four defeats from four games antics of last season, but they form just part of what is now a nine-game winless run for United against Spurs in all competitions.",
      "Imagine that. Imagine going nine straight games against the stupidest team in the world without a single win; it would be enough to make you think that maybe you are in fact the stupidest team in the world. Now there’s a thought.",
      "The last time Man United beat Spurs, Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick and Harry Kane was on the scoresheet. It was a long time ago, is what we’re saying here, and seems even longer than it actually is, which is a less impressive-sounding ‘just under four years ago’.",
      "We also think Spurs will win because we think United will lose. Obvious, but there you go. Simple reason being that recent history tells us that United will always lose in ludicrous fashion at the precise moment they think they’re on to something.",
      "No club turns more corners only to end up right back where they began than United, and three straight wins is just about perfect. We all obviously thought the Fulham game was ideal ‘come unstuck’ territory after beating City and Arsenal but think about it. That was too obvious. That was such an obviously different game from those first two of the Carrick Era that it would’ve been too predictable for it to go wrong there.",
      "No, far better to scrape through that by the skin of their arse and then actually come unstuck a week later against Banter FC.",
      "We do, admittedly, have some time for the counter-argument that what United will actually do is keep winning games until they eventually give in and, against their better judgement, give Carrick the job permanently only for results to then fall off a cliff.",
      "Which leads us to the safest conclusion of all. The funniest outcome here is for Spurs to win, or at least not lose, or for Man United to win.",
      "We can’t wait.",
      "Pep Guardiola may wish that Manchester City had spent more on players, but he can’t complain at their willingness to pay big wages…",
      "Spurs defender Cristian Romero has been urged to “shut up and play football,” with one pundit claiming Thomas Frank should strip him of the captaincy.",
      "To celebrate National 80s Day – it’s a thing, apparently – test your knowledge of football through the decade. Or ask your dad…",
      "Sandro Tonali ignored journalists in the mixed zone TWICE – so can only possibly be leaving Newcastle after being ‘courted by’ close friend Pep Guardiola.",
      "The Newcastle fan sentiment towards Eddie Howe has turned: he has done a phenomenal job but no longer is he the definitive best man for it. Is Jesse Marsch?",
      "The Premier League weekend begins and ends with a couple of highly promising opportunities for nonsense, with more good stuff in between."

      "Angel Gomes was being heralded as the possible solution for Manchester United and England a little over a year ago, but now the diminutive midfield conductor finds himself at rock-bottom Wolves after a summer move to Marseille failed to pay dividends. But might a brief spell in the Premier League open up a back door to his boyhood team?",
      "“Coming here, I’ll try and show what I can do, what I’m about, try and be a positive addition to the team, and try to be as positive as possible to help in all aspects,” Gomes has said having made the loan switch to Wolves, aware that the rest of the season will act as a four-month shop window for alternative suitors.",
      "Given his “excitement” at returning to the Premier League, he’s not about to agree to a permanent move to a Championship-bound side, should Wolves take up the option from Marseille, if there are top flight sides keen on signing him in the summer.",
      "After Jose Mourinho nearly made him cry at Manchester United amid a crisis of confidence which threatened to derail his career entirely, Gomes opted to leave for France despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s attempts to keep him at Old Trafford. Some hugely impressive displays at the heart of Lille’s midfield led to a shock England call from Lee Carsley for the Nations League games at the end of 2024.",
      "At that stage, when Manchester United were knee-deep in a midfield crisis which has now abated but not yet been solved, Gomes was heavily linked with a return to his former club, for whom he made his senior debut alongside a certain Michael Carrick.",
      "“I came on and Michael Carrick did everything possible to allow me to touch the ball,” Gomes told The Guardian about his United debut in 2018. “Every time he had it, I could see that he was looking for me.”",
      "Carrick named Gomes, along with Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku, Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard, as “real, real talent” which made him feel as though he could retire with the club in safe hands. There’s clearly a mutual respect.",
      "Whether there’s enough respect to push Carrick into vouching for Gomes in a discussion with the INEOS bosses over midfield additions in the summer remains to be seen, which when added to the uncertainty of Carrick’s long-term future at the club and if the United chiefs will take any notice of his thoughts on transfers if he is handed the reins on a permanent basis combines to make Gomes to Manchester United feel a whole lot of unlikely.",
      "But amid talk of the Red Devils analysts processing the stats of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba with a view to picking their ideal new midfielder, very little has been made of the very high likelihood that they’ll need two of them, if – as we’re led to believe – Manuel Ugarte is set to follow Casemiro out of the club having failed to meet the mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Unless they have £200m to spend on two of those three top candidates, and they don’t, United are going to need to source a low-cost option to bolster the squad on top of that marquee addition.",
      "Truth is it’s going to be hard for Gomes to prove he’s that option in one of the worst teams in Premier League history, just as it will be hard for commentators to cover Wolves games featuring Angel Gomes alongside namesakes Joao, Rodrigo and Toti, but at least he’s been handed the chance to knock on that back door to Manchester United, which Carrick may be more amenable than others to open if he’s still in the job."

      "Arsenal spent big on Zubimendi and it’s instantly paid off, with those around him taking their game to another level, namely Declan Rice.",
      "Sunderland, meanwhile, were ambitious enough to convince Xhaka to return to the Premier League. They immediately gave him the captaincy, and his leadership and quality have elevated the Black Cats.",
      "Anyway, signings of the season ahoy. Here’s our Premier League top 10. Click here for those signings who might just be a bit sh*t.",
      "",
      "From Bertrand Traore for only £2.1m to Habib Diarra for £27m via Granit Xhaka for £13m, Sunderland’s summer business has aged tremendously. We honestly can’t believe how successful their signings have been.",
      "With the exception of Simon Adingra, Sunderland didn’t waste a single penny. Reinildo on a free transfer has been a revelation and Sadiki has made £15m look like an absolute bargain as well.",
      "The former Union St-Gilloise midfielder gave up Champions League football to join the ambitious Black Cats and will not regret that decision. Of all the players Regis Le Bris brought to the club last summer, he feels the most likely to land a huge transfer to a Big Six club.",
      "",
      "Summer signings Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are proving to be very good, very important Manchester United players.",
      "The Red Devils missed Mbeumo during his Africa Cup of Nations exploits and his return has added new life to an attack enjoying their football under Michael Carrick.",
      "Naturally a right-winger, Mbeumo has been played through the middle for United and looks a handful for defenders. His link-up play is good and while he doesn’t win many aerial duels, he is competing for the ball and allowing his team-mates to gobble up second balls. He has been crucial.",
      "",
      "Sunderland dominate this ranking, with Alderete coming in as the second of five Black Cats summer signings.",
      "This guy is a dog. His player-of-the-match performance against Manchester City epitomised everything he’s about. He has that South American bravery that sees him put his body on the line time and time again. He’s just fantastic.",
      "We’re not sure how Sunderland have nailed their summer business to this extent, but they’ve made some absolutely outstanding signings for very modest fees.",
      "",
      "Manchester City signed arguably the best goalkeeper in the world for just £26m. That’s probably all that needs to be said.",
      "Yes, Donnarumma isn’t entirely convincing with the ball at his feet, but he’s hardly clumsy and is arguably underrated in that regard. Pep Guardiola wouldn’t sign him if he didn’t fit the plan, even as Pep adapts to a more direct style in his latest football revolution.",
      "The Italian’s presence has brought calm to City’s backline and he is a monster of a signing in every sense.",
      "",
      "Another monster Man City signing.",
      "Cherki has shown he can win City points on his own and, aside from the goals and assists, he’s simply an incredibly exciting player to watch.",

      "",
      "Leeds made some solid additions last summer but none have been better than brilliant German midfielder Stach.",
      "He has added a threat to set-pieces with his ability to take them and his incredible height. Stach brings control to the Leeds midfield and dominates most of his individual battles. Simply put: he’s brilliant.",
      "Stach’s team-mate Dominic Calvert-Lewin deserves an honourable mention.",
      "",
      "If we’re being brutally honest, the signing of Mukiele looked nailed on to be a waste of time and money. It’s been anything but.",
      "Arriving from Paris Saint-Germain after a loan spell at Bayer Leverkusen, he seemed destined to flop.",
      "Instead, the Frenchman has adapted seamlessly to Premier League football, excelling in both a back four and a back five under Regis Le Bris.",
      "",
      "Premier League pacesetters Arsenal look excellent and Zubimendi is a big reason why.",
      "The Spaniard has slotted perfectly into the No.6 role, freeing Declan Rice to push forward and setting off a domino effect that’s lifted Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard too.",
      "He keeps things ticking over beautifully, with the defensive steel Mikel Arteta craves. It will take something special to reach Rodri levels of control, but Zubimendi might be the final piece of Arsenal’s title-winning puzzle.",

      "Sunderland’s summer business has been a roaring success, and Roefs has been at the heart of it.",

      "",
      "Premier League signing of the season: Granit Xhaka.",
      "We couldn’t believe Xhaka wanted to swap Bayer Leverkusen for Sunderland, especially given the record of newly promoted sides. But his arrival has gone a long way to ensuring the Black Cats buck that trend.",
      "Le Bris’ side remain unbeaten at home since returning to the top flight, with the only game they’ve failed to score in coming in the 0-0 draw against Man City on New Year’s Day.",
      "The Switzerland and Sunderland captain has clearly raised the levels at the Stadium of Light and looks one of the best No.6s in the league, underlining just how vital that position has become.",
      "It’s no coincidence that Zubimendi, Sadiki, Stach and Xhaka are all in this top 10, and that Rodri won the Ballon d’Or last year. The defensive midfield role has become the position every manager wants to build around.",
      "Eddie Howe told Newcastle that they ‘can’t rely on one player’ as their miserable form without Bruno Guimaraes continued. But Sunderland should listen too.",

      "“How he’s playing with his teams, because he plays possession-based football, he’s very good on the ball. He also sets the players in certain positions that it makes it really difficult for the opposition to press them.",
      "“You know, he’s going forward, he attacks. Scores a lot of goals, sometimes concedes, but you know that as a manager.",
      "“But I think he’s also a good man-manager. I think he’s also good with the players and giving them the confidence, giving them the attention they need – and not only the starting XI, but also the other players within the squad.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are prepared to replace Marcus Rashford in their squad next summer, with the club having targeted two potential options to replace the on-loan Barcelona man as they look for a new attacker who can bring a new edge and greater creativity.",
      "Rashford is expected to complete a permanent move to Barcelona, and his departure would help open the door for United to add a new attacking option as part of the next phase of their rebuild.",
      "While midfield remains the top priority for Man Utd heading into the summer window, the club have already signalled their intent to strengthen out wide.",
      "Their earlier attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo, who eventually ended up at rivals Man City, was viewed internally as an indication that a winger would be added, even if it was not the immediate focus. Now, with Rashford’s permanent exit increasingly likely, sources believe United will revisit the winger market.",
      "One name emerging strongly is Yan Diomande. Indeed, there is a growing feeling within recruitment circles that Diomande could be the first option United explore as a replacement.",
      "Other clubs who have enquired about the RB Leipzig winger have come away with the understanding that United are very much in the picture and could lead the race for his signature when the summer window opens.",
      "Diomande, who could cost as much as €100m (£86m / $118m), has scored eight goals and added six assists in 21 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig so far this season and remains one of the most talked about attacking talents in Europe.",
      "We have also reported how United will look towards Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye as a target from within the Premier League. The Senegal international, who is capable of playing on both wings but largely operates on the right, has a combined goals/assists tally of six this season in 20 appearances for the Toffees.",
      "His current market value is £39m (€45m  / $53m), as per Transfermarkt, although Everton will almost certainly demand more to sell to a Premier League rival, especially with the 25-year-old under contract until 2029.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Meanwhile, my TEAMtalk colleague Graeme Bailey can also reveal, via sources, how Rashford “has not spoken to anyone at Manchester United about the possibility of returning to Old Trafford, despite ongoing negotiations between the two clubs over his long‑term future”, as there appears to be no way back for the player.",
      "Bailey revealed: “Senior United sources insist that nobody at the club – including interim boss Michael Carrick – has contacted Rashford regarding a comeback. The message from the player’s camp is equally clear: Rashford has no intention of returning to Manchester and remains fully committed to Barcelona.",
      "“Rashford and his representatives are aligned with Barca’s vision for him, and the Catalan giants have assured the England international that he will continue at the Camp Nou beyond this season. Barcelona hold a £26million option to buy, and we are told Rashford is so determined to stay that he has even indicated he would be willing to give up part of his salary to help reduce the overall cost of the move.",
      "“With two-and-a-half years remaining on his lucrative United contract, such a gesture underlines how strongly he feels about continuing his career in Catalunya.",
      "“As our sources previously revealed, United are keen to avoid a scenario in which Barcelona attempt to negotiate another loan deal next season. Discussions are ongoing over how a permanent transfer could be structured, but Rashford’s stance leaves little room for doubt: his future lies in Spain, not in Manchester.",
      "“Despite being pleased to see United’s recent resurgence under Carrick, sources close to the forward insist that Barcelona is the only club he wants to play for going forward. Indeed, Rashford is described as ‘very happy’ with his life in Catalunya, both on and off the pitch, and there is no desire whatsoever to return to Old Trafford.",
      "“For United, the situation is becoming increasingly clear. For Barcelona, the path to a permanent deal is open. And for Rashford, the message is unmistakable: he sees his future at the Camp Nou, and nowhere else.”",
      "Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
      "United decided against moving for Wilfred Ndidi during the January transfer window, despite getting the green light from the player himself, with the club instead ready to put their entire energies into a mammoth summer rebuild and with four huge midfielder deals shortlisted instead.",
      "Elsewhere, Man Utd need a player such as Micky van de Ven to elevate their starting XI, according to Peter Schmeichel, and TEAMtalk can confirm the Red Devils are among the clubs showing interest in the Dutch star.",
      "Meanwhile, the Red Devils are being backed to spring the ‘cut-price’ signing of Jean-Philippe Mateta in the summer, although there could be a rather large drawback to any move."

      "The report has listed four potential next transfers for Man Utd, with a second midfielder to be targeted as Manuel Ugarte’s ‘future is uncertain’, while the ‘left-wing could also be looked at’.",
      "The report explains: ‘Each of Nottingham Forest, Brighton & Hove Albion and Crystal Palace were always unlikely to allow one of their best and most valuable players to leave mid-season, but are expected to be more open to business come the summer.",

      "But Romano has revealed that United were handed the opportunity to sign a new midfielder as former Leicester star Wilfred Ndidi, who was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford when he instead made the switch to Besiktas in the summer of 2024, was ‘offered’ to the Red Devils and was ‘keen on the move.",

Or did Wilcox and co. learn their lesson about letting an inexperienced manager bring in an equally inexperienced staff and instead, through their own connections and discussions with Carrick, put together their ideal team, a balanced mix of experience and youth with genuine ties to the club and national team?",
      "With every top-level manager insisting on bringing his own team, the cost goes up and the club ties disappear, while the risk barely drops and the hope barely rises. That type of appointment also seems to contradict the board’s long-term plan. From the beginning, they talked about a unified, cooperative structure that brings back the so-called “United DNA”: get results, improve players, connect with the fan base, promote young coaches and local players, all built on hard work and technical quality.",

Handing control back to a bigger name would contradict that. The gamble also then becomes whether that big name eventually cedes some control or doubles down, potentially leaving us right back where we were with Amorim. Of course, if Carrick were to stumble across the finish line instead, it might be the only option left.",

We’re hearing stories of players like Dorgu staying behind after training, Sesko and Cunha taking recovery more seriously, and players generally looking after themselves better.

He’s overcome adversity and disappointment to establish himself as the leader in midfield. Tough year, head down, took his chance. Never bitched or moaned once. His simple brother did, but you can’t be surprised by simple people doing simple things.",
      "Before that though, hang on to Bruno for another four or five years. Man’s a genius. The usual criticism is that he disrupts shape with his one-man heroics and needs more discipline. But his game has never been about speed, it’s about speed of thought. As his legs naturally slow, he’ll be forced to be stricter positionally. And as the team around him becomes more structured, with a younger, fitter Casemiro replacement behind him, and Kobbie continuing to develop, we might actually see an even better version of Fernandes.",

      "– They ARE dull to watch. Hugely effective, very strong defensively, but just not exciting for neutrals. Winning is of course the name of the game, and it brings its own buzz for their fans, but you can be successful without setting pulses racing. That’s the case with Arsenal this season, and that’s fine. Plenty of previous league winners have been similarly solid. Their fans are right not to particularly care how they go about ending a title famine of 20+ years.",
      "– Comparisons to Liverpool’s stroll last season are also pretty valid, in the sense that none of the other contenders are performing at the level they would have expected. City are horribly inconsistent compared to previous seasons. Liverpool, Chelsea and United are all some combination of work in progress/shambles/regression. Villa lack depth, largely thanks to PSR. Arsenal have so far taken advantage of all that, very similar to Liverpool’s serene run last season. It doesn’t mean it’s a terrible league, or that they’d be bad champions, but the margin for error is far higher than they could have anticipated.",
      "– If they fail to get over the line, it will be objectively hilarious for everyone else. Arteta’s cartoonish intensity rubs a lot of fans up the wrong way, which I think Arsenal fans probably understand. The players sometimes mirror it too – he has them wound up like springs, hence some of the insane celebrations we’ve seen from them in the past.",
      "The derogatory narratives have of course been set in stone by rival fan groups, getting their rationalisations for their own teams’ failure prepared nice and early. “They won it by playing crap football”, “It was handed to them”, “They had to win it sooner or later by the law of averages”, etc. It must be fantastic for level-headed Arsenal fans to recognise that this all stems from the increasing likelihood of them making it over the line in the next few months.",

Any Arsenal fan under the later Wenger years watched Arsenal between fingers knowing they could concede at any time, particularly against the big teams. That anxiety is gone under Arteta. Only replaced with the cautious anxiety of trying to win games to be champions.",

      "‘Wolves’ firm stance was underpinned by the fact they had already cashed in on striker Jørgen Strand Larsen, who joined Crystal Palace for a record club fee earlier in the window. With significant funds already secured, the West Midlands club had no pressing need to sell Mateus Mané and were comfortable resisting advances.",
      "‘That confidence was reflected in a late move to line up Girona forward Vladyslav Vanat as a potential Strand Larsen replacement, but despite groundwork being done, a deadline-day deal ultimately failed to materialise.",
      "The report further claims that Mane ‘remains focused’ at Wolves for now, but with Liverpool and Man Utd both ‘making enquiries through his representatives’ the summer could ‘prompt record-breaking transfer attempts for Mane’, with Wolves’ final position a ‘key factor’ in his future."

      "“I think Tonali would work really well in that United midfield,” Simpson told Metro via Meta Spins Casino.",
      "“I think he would complement Kobbie Mainoo really nicely, because he gets about the pitch so well.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a top player for Newcastle. He’s good on the ball, he’s strong, he’s physical, he’d be a brilliant player in there in many regards.",

      "Next up is an Old Trafford clash with his former club Tottenham on Saturday. The 44-year-old says he would not get carried away if they won again - and nor does he believe the club would.",

      "Friday 6 February 2026 20:47, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight ahead of a busy Premier League weekend.",
      "A record number of goals are being scored from dead-ball situations this season, corners are such dangerous avenues for goals and centre-backs with aerial dominance have never been more valuable from a betting perspective. Yet one of the best set-piece attackers in world football has barely been on the pitch for most of it.",
      "Harry Maguire is back in the Manchester United fold, though, and looking in fine fettle in both boxes. Since returning, he has registered four shots in just 281 minutes, generating an expected goals figure of 0.62, which is of course a chunky output for a centre-half. That includes hitting the crossbar against Manchester City.",
      "There is value to be had on Maguire and it is in his shots prices - most notably his headed shots price of 10/11 with Sky Bet. Across the last six Premier League seasons, only Virgil van Dijk is recording a headed shot at a higher rate than Maguire - one every 177 minutes.",
      "Whenever this bet is 10/11 or bigger it's an automatic back for me if Manchester United are the favourites to win the game.",
      "Like most Arsenal home games against anyone outside the elite, this is a challenging betting heat where the Gunners are 1/5 with Sky Bet to land the odds. Other traditional markets like the over/under 2.5 line are priced up correctly too so we have to get creative here for an angle.",
      "Trai Hume's fouls committed prices are worth a look at Evens for 2+ with Sky Bet.",
      "Hume has made 16 fouls in his last eight starts, averaging out perfectly at that two fouls line with a switch of position helping to keep those fouls numbers bulky. He's playing more as an inverted wide midfielder rather than a full-back and being in the heat of the battle against the Gunners will see him threaten that fouls line.",
      "Bournemouth to make the most fouls in each half at 11/10 with Sky Bet is a wager that's cashed in each of the last five head-to-head meetings.",
      "That's no fluke.",
      "This fixture is consistently foul heavy because of the tactical clash between the managers as Villa under Unai Emery are happy to play fast and vertically, forcing Bournemouth into reactive defending, broken play and ultimately, fouls, to stop transitions. The numbers back it up too as the head-to-head record shows Bournemouth average 17 fouls per game, compared to just 10 for Aston Villa.",
      "At odds-against, backing Bournemouth to win the foul count in both halves looks a smart way to play a match-up that keeps telling us the same story.",
      "Crysencio Summerville is thriving under Nuno Espirito Santo, not only in terms of his overall attacking output but also in the way he is terrifying defenders.",
      "The only way to stop him is to foul him which is leading to cards. Under Nuno, Summerville has drawn 12 cards off the opposition - that's the most of any player in the Premier League this season. Kyle Walker will be the man responsible for stopping him - a player who has been carded eight times already this season. The 100/30 with Sky Bet for a Walker card is very generous.",
      "James Garner to have 2+ shots at 11/8 with Sky Bet makes appeal.",
      "Garner's development this season has been a real success story for David Moyes, who has pushed him higher from midfield which has allowed him to get himself into shooting positions rather than just recycling possession. The raw numbers tell the story as no Everton player has attempted more shots this season than Garner (39), which underlines just how licence-heavy his role has become. This match-up suits that trend too. He fired off four shots in the reverse fixture against Fulham.",
      "Yerson Mosquera to score for Wolves at 16/1 with Sky Bet is firmly on the radar against a Chelsea side that continue to look alarmingly vulnerable from dead-ball situations.",
      "Only Crystal Palace have conceded more expected goals from set-pieces than Chelsea this season (12.67 xG), while 10 actual goals shipped from those scenarios underlines that this is a structural problem, not bad luck.",
      "And one that hasn't been solved since the change of manager.",
      "That will be music to the ears of a Wolves side who are unapologetically set-piece orientated under Rob Edwards, with delivery and movement clearly drilled on the training ground. Mosquera is becoming increasingly prominent in those situations too. He's gone close in recent weeks, racking up 11 shots across his last six games and was desperately unlucky to hit the post against Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Rico Henry to be carded at 9/2 with Sky Bet looks a lovely angle to attack because of what's brewing down that flank in terms of fouls in this game. Henry is likely to spend large periods dealing with Anthony Elanga and that's a match-up that tends to end with the defender running the risk of a card.",
      "Since the start of last season, Elanga has drawn 20 yellow cards from opponents, using his pace and direct running to force last-ditch challenges when he shifts the ball past his man. The timing looks right too. Elanga showed signs of hitting form again in his last outing against Manchester City, scoring a beauty of a goal and carrying a real threat in transition when repeatedly engaging his full-back one on one.",
      "Crystal Palace have not won in their last 12 games in all competitions but everyone knows about their current plight. But it's pretty gloomy at Brighton too, who have finally started to prove me right in how much of an overrated team they are. Just one win in 11 games means Fabian Hurzeler is facing huge pressure now.",
      "And, this is exactly the type of opposition they struggle against: low block, long quick vertical football and a head-to-head record of winning just two of the last 13 games with their rivals. Looking at the match odds, where Brighton are around Evens, market forces are also now becoming cold on this Brighton team which is quite a big pointer that Hurzeler is going to struggle to turn this around.",
      "Trusting Palace though isn't viable either, meaning the draw makes lots of sense to back at 13/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Liverpool at 11/8 with Sky Bet? Sign me up.",
      "Since drawing at Leeds, their defensive numbers are back to where they were last season, offering up very little to the opposition in terms of big chances. Across their last 13 games, they've conceded just 0.75 goals per game to a backdrop of 0.8 expected goals against per game. Arne Slot has fixed the leak.",
      "Yet, Man City's defensive structure and out-of-possession play has quietly become a cause for concern. They are showing signs of the same problems of last season where teams were finding it so easy to play through the City midfield and defence to create big chances.",
      "Since they drew with Chelsea, in six games where they've gone off bigger than 1/3 to win, they've been repeatedly badly exposed defensively, shipping an expected goals against tally of 1.6 per 90 and facing 4.8 shots on target per 90.",
      "Liverpool may run riot if City don't tighten up, meaning the home team handicap market at -1 at 7/2 with Sky Bet is a lovely way to back Slot's men to win by two or more goals."

United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",

      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Tuesday 3 February 2026 08:47, UK",
      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "Fulham substitute Kevin followed up Raul Jimenez's late penalty with a super strike to level things up in added time but, in another classic under the new boss, Sesko struck as Carrick matched Ruben Amorim's longest Premier League winning streak at Man Utd in dramatic fashion.",

      "After impressively beating Arsenal and Manchester City, Carrick's United passed another test that had its fair share of refereeing controversy.",
      "The first incident came in the build-up to Man Utd's opener as they were initially awarded a penalty after Matheus Cunha was judged to have been brought down by Jorge Cuenca. However, after a VAR check, the decision was overturned, with Cuenca clearly winning the ball, although the hosts were given a free-kick for a shirt pull instead - much to Marco Silva's fury.",

      "In that case, the VAR could intervene by declaring the decision a factual error and award a free-kick instead.",
      "From the resulting free-kick, Casemiro headed home a Bruno Fernandes delivery for his fifth of the campaign. After announcing his departure at the end of the season, the midfielder is enjoying a farewell tour.",
      "Cunha, who made a return to the starting line-up in the only change to the side in place of the injured Patrick Dorgu, thundered in to double Man Utd's advantage in the second half.",
      "Fulham thought they had pulled one back when Cuenca tapped in a deflected Samuel Chukwueze shot that fell kindly into his path. However, after a VAR check that lasted around four minutes, the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.",
      "But after being brought down by Harry Maguire in the area, Jimenez scored from the spot, before Kevin's stunning equaliser looked like it had rescued a point for Marco Silva's side.",

      "Sunday 1 February 2026 17:54, UK",
      "Marco Silva claims VAR overturned Manchester United's penalty in their 3-2 victory over Fulham for a different foul because the original decision by referee John Brooks was \"so bad\".",
      "Brooks awarded United a first-half penalty at Old Trafford after Matheus Cunha went down in the area under a sliding tackle from Jorge Cuenca, but replays showed the Fulham centre-back had won the ball.",
      "VAR James Bell overturned the decision and awarded a free-kick instead for a shirt pull on Cunha by Cuenca, with Casemiro heading in the opener from Bruno Fernandes' cross at the resulting set-piece.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre said Cuenca's holding offence had ended before entering the box, which is why the decision was overturned, but Silva says he was told Brooks awarded the penalty for the tackle.",

      "Silva added: \"The main thing from VAR is to correct things and make it right. Definitely not to over-referee the game or go in a different direction. They are there to help the referees make good decisions.",
      "\"The offside goal is by a [small] margin. It happened with us already this season, where goals were disallowed by [small] margins. The idea of automated offside is to be quicker than it was, but sometimes it's not easy. We have to accept it. We cannot control it.",
      "\"The first one is much more difficult to accept because of the feedback we got. All of the people in the stadium felt the penalty was given because of the tackle.\"",
