      "Rio Ferdinand has offered his take on Michael Carrick's future(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents/YouTube)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has taken a swipe at former Manchester United teammate Roy Keane for his view on Michael Carrick’s future. The ex-Red Devils midfielder has endured a dream stint at Old Trafford, leading the club to four consecutive wins.",
      "That has triggered a huge reaction from fans, with some demanding that Carrick be handed the job on a permanent basis. His contract is only set to run until the end of the season.",
      "Keane, however, is not yet convinced and claimed that club chiefs should stick with their original plan of appointing a more established name ahead of next term. Ferdinand has responded to his opinion and claimed that he can’t quite wrap his head around it.",
      "“There's risks with anyone that goes in there,” he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. “No matter what Michael Carrick does, how well he does, and if he got the job on the back of a great ending to the season, there's still risk.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“There's an element of risk, but with every one of the names that get thrown into the hat, there an element of risk with all of them.",
      "“I don't know in any walk of life, where someone comes in given the opportunity to do well, and put their first foot forward for a job opportunity, they smash it - and hopefully he carries on, at the moment he’s smashing it, four wins out of four, and people are going ‘no, he shouldn’t get it though’.",
      "“I don't understand that with Roy, I've got to be honest. I don't know how you can be so against it.”",
      "While Keane has taken a hard-line stance on Carrick’s future, he appears to have softened over recent days. Having completely ruled out a permanent appointment originally, he recently claimed that he could understand if United chiefs choose to stick with him even though it wouldn’t be his call.",
      "Michael Carrick has had an eye-catching impact at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He said: “I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it. Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go ‘listen, good luck to him’, but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be",
      "“I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud (Van Nistelrooy), he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "“But just cause you're doing well at United, it doesn't mean he'll do well at another club. He's got the players back, it's all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he's took advantage of it.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Christian Pulisic left Chelsea for AC Milan(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United and Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing ex-Chelsea star Christian Pulisic following a standout season. The American winger, currently with AC Milan, has shone in Serie A over the past few campaigns following his exit from Chelsea.",
      "He has 10 goals in all competitions for the Italian giants - that form following seasons in which he has hit 15 and 16 goals respectively. And it appears those displays have not gone unnoticed, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "As per CalcioMercato, top-flight trio Man United, Arsenal and Tottenham are all keeping a close eye on the 27-year-old. It is suggested that any interested suitors could take advantage of Pulisic’s contractual situation - his current deal with AC Milan expiring in 2027.",
      "It is believed that an offer of around €55m (£48m) would be enough to tempt the Serie A side into selling. Chelsea originally signed him for £57m from Borussia Dortmund back in 2019 but he struggled for consistency at Stamford Bridge, scoring just 26 times across 145 appearances.",
      "They eventually sold him for around £20m. Pulisic has also been backed for a move to MLS in the near future but former Tottenham goalkeeper Brad Friedel has suggested that he should only consider that switch later in his career.",
      "Speaking to Goal, he said: \"In the future, yes. It’s like this – just from a U.S. fan standpoint, I want as many of the best players for the national team playing at the highest level of competition they can, because that will make sure that the national team competes stronger against the world ’s elite.",
      "\"I like it when players don’t know when their next contract is coming, they always have the next young player pushing to take their spot, they have to always get better.",
      "\"If somebody came in like your Weston McKennie and your Christian Pulisic, they would have so much power at an MLS club, I would worry that they wouldn’t be focused on just getting better.",
      "Pulisic has been in brilliant form for AC Milan over recent seasons(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Eventually I would love to see Christian and Weston and Tyler [Adams] come back and all these guys finish their careers in MLS. That would be great. But in the peak of their career, I don’t think MLS is there yet.\"",
      "Pulisic is however expected to be one of the poster boys for the upcoming World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico. The winger has collected 82 caps for the US and scored 32 goals since his debut in 2016.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick celebrates",
      "The London Stadium will stage an intriguing Premier League clash on Tuesday night as West Ham United host Manchester United, with both sides enjoying recent revivals. The Hammers are aiming for a fifth win in six matches after a 2-0 victory over Burnley, while Manchester United, under Michael Carrick, kept their strong run going with a 2-0 win against 10-man Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Carrick, a former Hammer himself, has had nothing but a positive impact on the visitors, guiding United to four straight wins—including triumphs over Arsenal, Manchester City, and Fulham—and keeping them firmly in the hunt for a Champions League spot. The Red Devils have scored at least twice in every match under Carrick and are now just three points behind third-placed Aston Villa. Their attack has been prolific, with goals in each of their last 14 games in all competitions, and only one defeat in their last nine away fixtures.",
      "West Ham, meanwhile, have also turned their season around, collecting nine points from their last four league games. Recent goals from Crysencio Summerville and Taty Castellanos secured a crucial win at Burnley, lifting the Hammers to within three points of safety. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have now won four of their last five matches, a significant improvement after a difficult start to the campaign. However, home form remains a concern, with just one win in their last 16 home league games against established Premier League teams. Despite this, West Ham have beaten Manchester United on each of the Red Devils’ last three visits to the London Stadium.",
      "Manchester United’s injury list remains unchanged following Saturday’s win, with Patrick Dorgu (thigh), Mason Mount, and Matthijs de Ligt (back) still sidelined. The quick turnaround could prompt Michael Carrick to rotate, with Benjamin Sesko and Noussair Mazraoui possible options, but the absence of European fixtures means the same starting XI is likely. Bruno Fernandes, now involved in 200 goals for United, is one assist away from breaking the club’s record for most away assists in a Premier League season, currently tied with Ryan Giggs at eight.",
      "For West Ham, Nuno Espirito Santo is expected to have the same squad available, still missing suspended Jean-Clair Todibo and injured goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski (back). Todibo’s suspension allowed Axel Disasi to debut against Burnley, and he should feature again at home. Captain Jarrod Bowen will look to add to his three goals in his last five league games against United, while Crysencio Summerville aims to score for a sixth consecutive match in all competitions.",

United chiefs have given no clue as to who will take on the manager's job permanently next term, but the former Red Devils midfielder is certainly staking his claim for the position.",

      "Rashford's future at Manchester United remains an ever-present topic of discussion, with the Red Devils loanee attempting to revive his career at Barcelona.",

      "Rashford took the injured Raphinha's place in Barcelona's XI, starting a match for the first time since January 3. The Englishman was hooked in the second half and was given a standing ovation by fans as he exited the pitch.",

      "\"Taking [Hansi] Flick's challenge to heart, he assumed attacking responsibility when the game looked its worst, producing the most dangerous shots, the second leading to the 1-0 goal, and sending a beautiful free kick straight off the crossbar. Substituted to well-deserved applause.\"",
      "AS, meanwhile, pointed out that Rashford's form has improved throughout the season as he's found his feet in Spain. And the Barca Universal website gave the striker an 8.5/10 rating.",
      "\"Rashford was perhaps Barcelona's most potent threat in the first half as he did not hesitate to cut in and shoot, creating a ruckus in the Mallorca area and bombarding Roman’s goal with powerful strikes,\" its report read.",
      "\"He also did well providing a wide threat, although his crosses were well defended for the greater part. In fact, the opening goal stemmed from his shot on goal, which fell kindly for [Robert] Lewandowski.\"",
      "Neville has lifted the lid on United's process for hiring a new permanent boss, claiming he personally spoke to the club and that the search for a permanent Amorin replacement is very much underway.",
      "Speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago, and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "Gary Neville says Man United's search for a new permanent boss is underway(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",

They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.\"",

United travel to in-form West Ham in the Premier League on Tuesday night hoping to continue their perfect start under Carrick - and another win would have a knock-on effect.",
      "Supporter Frank Ilett has vowed not to cut his hair until United rack up five victories on the spin. He started posting on social media about the idea in October 2024 and is currently over 500 days without a trim.",
      "Known as The United Strand, he has amassed over two million followers on social media, with his bushy hair going viral during the difficult times under Ruben Amorim. But Carrick's arrival as interim manager last month has raised the prospect of it coming to an end.",
      "Carrick has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham and it's now just West Ham who can stop Ilett from getting his wild mane chopped. \"I can say I'm aware of it, yeah,\" Carrick said when asked about Ilett in his pre-match press conference.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"My kids have made me aware of it, if anything, but it certainly won't go into the team talk from a professional level. I can understand what's going on with it and it does make me smile but it won't have an impact ultimately in the end.\"",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes was asked a similar question after scoring in the 2-0 win over 10-man Spurs on Saturday, but gave it short shrift. \"I need to book for myself, I don’t look at other people,\" Fernandes said. “I don't look if they need to go to the hair dresser or not, that is not important for me.”",
      "United have been transformed under Carrick's leadership and sit fourth in the Premier League after their winning run. West Ham, by contrast, occupy the final relegation spot in 18th place, but three wins in their last four matches will make them a tricky prospect at the London Stadium.",
      "Frank Ilett has not cut his hair in over 500 days(Image: @TheUnitedStrand/INSTAGRAM)",
      "But a haircut could be around the corner",
      "\"You definitely take the confidence and the feeling from the games that you've had knowing you can go into the next game with a little bit more feel-good factor about it,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"I guess the big challenge is knowing what's got you there and all the hard work and the preparation and then what it takes to win a game of football at this level is tough, so never assuming the next one's just going to be alright.\"",

      "It marked his fourth win in a row since taking over as interim head coach last month - the first time the side have managed such a run since Erik ten Hag’s reign. The former Middlesbrough boss took over from Ruben Amorim halfway through a turbulent season but has since steered the side to fourth place in the Premier League, meaning they are on track to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Monumental wins over Manchester City and Arsenal under Carrick have encapsulated a perfect start to his tenure. Despite the plan initially being for the 44-year-old to only hold the position until this summer, United’s impressive results have led some fans and pundits to call for his permanent appointment.",
      "Speaking on the eve of Saturday's game against Spurs, however, Carrick himself insisted there could be no \"knee-jerk\" decisions over the role. And he could be set for a huge blow following indications that the club hierarchy are still looking elsewhere for a long-term managerial appointment.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken openly about his own mistakes, notably the impulsive decision to renew Ten Hag’s contract in July 2024 after he won the FA Cup, despite it not being the right call in the grand scheme of things. Instead, United appear to now be taking a more measured and less emotional approach, which could mean Carrick may not be deemed the right permanent candidate even if he is successful from now until the end of the season.",

Prior to his spell in the second-tier, he was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's coaching staff at Old Trafford and also enjoyed a brief caretaker stint after the Norwegian was sacked in 2021. Neville, however, went on to raise the question of whether or not his fellow United legend would actually put himself forward for the role full-time.",
      "The pundit added: \"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",

      "Sandro Tonali could leave Newcastle in the summer(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Sandro Tonali is weighing up a departure from Newcastle United this summer in pursuit of Champions League football next season. The midfielder has been associated with Manchester United in recent days as the club plans to strengthen its midfield.",
      "United are believed to be making a fresh central midfielder a priority for the 2026/27 campaign after choosing not to invest during the previous two windows. Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton have all been mentioned, though Tonali represents the most recent name under consideration.",
      "The Telegraph has reported that the 25-year-old is anticipated to feature prominently in a transfer saga during the summer. United are already confirmed to lose one midfielder when Casemiro departs and are projected to spend substantially on his successor.",
      "Newcastle secured Tonali for £55million in 2023 and with the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Declan Rice commanding fees exceeding £100m, the Magpies are well positioned to demand a premium price. On deadline day, certain reports indicated that the Italian midfielder had been proposed to Arsenal.",
      "The Gunners opted against pursuing a deal, though that has raised questions about his future on Tyneside. According to Tonali's representative, Giuseppe Riso, his departure from Eddie Howe's squad remains possible at the season's conclusion.",
      "\"Newcastle are having a hard time of letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,\" he told Sky Italy. \"We'll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We'll see how the season ends and then we'll decide what to do. There's no preference at the moment.",
      "Sandro Tonali is on Manchester United's transfer radar(Image: Newcastle United via Getty Image)",
      "\"It's still early. What we're saying today won't apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn't let him go now, and there's no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.\"",
      "United's prospects of tempting Tonali to Old Trafford will be substantially boosted if Newcastle fails to salvage their campaign. Howe's side are presently 12th in the Premier League standings following erratic form, meaning their strongest hope of returning to the competition may depend on them winning the tournament this season.",
      "\"I don't think so, but lots of things happen without my knowledge,\" Howe responded when questioned if the rumours surrounding Tonali's future would disturb the midfielder. \"As far as I'm aware, we've got player who is an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.",

      "\"He's very happy here, he's got a great relationship with me, his teammates, and seems really happy within himself. That would surprise me [if Tonali became unsettled], but our best players will always attract glances from other clubs - that's just the reality of football.",
      "\"We want to keep our group together, we want to be progressive and Sandro plays a part in that. All encompassed, I don't see an issue but I don't control everything. There was certainly no intention from our side to lose Sandro at all. He's such an integral player to what we're doing. He's very happy here.",

      "Former Arsenal and England striker Wright has always been a fan of Mainoo and believes that, while his recent form is a boost to Carrick's reputation, it should also damage Amorim's. \"Everybody was confused with what was happening under Ruben Amorim,\" Wright said on the Premier League World Show after the win over Spurs.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"When you look at (Mainoo), someone who's not played, coming into a Man United side that's not in great form. To play in that midfield which is where all the questions have been around... just the quality.",
      "\"You're listening to Bruno [Fernandes] saying they've been given the freedom to express themselves because they're good players. And Kobbie is a very, very good player. I'm just pleased we're seeing that now.",
      "\"I think it's very embarrassing for Ruben Amorim if we're going to be totally honest. Because what we seen was a Man United youth product not given the opportunity to play and very, very close to leaving the club.\"",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has thrived under Michael Carrick(Image: Mike Morese/Getty Images)",
      "Mainoo wanted to join Napoli - and his former United team-mate Scott McTominay - in January, having grown frustrated by his status as a substitute under Amorim. The former manager's love of the 3-4-3 formation left him on the bench, with Casemiro and Fernandes in central midfield, but Carrick has made him a fixture alongside the Brazilian in a 4-2-3-1 formation.",
      "\"There's no doubt about Kobbie's ability and what he can bring,\" Carrick said after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Fernandes saw off 10-man Spurs. \"He's still so young and learning the game. He has had the big high and then not playing for a bit. It is easier to think he is older than he is.\",",
      "Mainoo's ultimate goal is to earn a place in Thomas Tuchel's squad for the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico this summer. He has not played for England since 2024 and faces an uphill battle to dislodge one of Tuchel's favourites in central midfield before the tournament begins on June 11.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo has now scored ten goals in all competitions for Manchester United this season(Image: James Gill/Danehouse)",
      "It was not his cleanest strike but it was a game-changer and one that brought wide smiles to Michael Carrick and his coaching staff. And the set-piece special gave Bryan Mbeumo his third goal in four games under Carrick. He is certainly enjoying life under the man who is, for now, only a short-term manager.",
      "Carrick has now celebrated four victories, his side scoring ten goals in the process. In their previous four Premier League games, Manchester United had won only one, scoring five goals in the process.",
      "It certainly looks like a quite spectacular resurgence but Mbeumo believes it is not as dramatic as most people like to make out. Mbeumo clearly believes they were making some sort of progress under Ruben Amorim.",
      "He explains: “I just feel we built on what we were doing from the start because I don't think it was that bad as a lot of people felt. We just work together, make the effort together, with a big mentality, and we're never beaten. Even if someone gets past, we come back to support and just try to give it our all.”",
      "Mbeumo now has ten goals in all competitions since his £71million move from Brentford in the summer and his latest effort came from a short-corner routine that was, in part, the training-ground work of Jonny Evans. Carrick praised Evans for his work but Mbeumo admitted things did not quite go to plan when they first tried it out.",
      "Mbeumo said: “It was Jonny Evans who was coming to me and the guys and we just tried to hit it. We did it once but it didn't work out. But this one was the most important.”",
      "Mbeumo struck soon after Spurs skipper Cristian Romero had been sent off and his goal sparked another carnival-style occasion at Old Trafford that ended with Bruno Fernandes sealing victory. The feelgood factor is definitely back.",
      "Michael Carrick has won all four of his games in this stint as Manchester United manager(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "The Cameroon striker smiled: “The fans are a massive community and we feel that when we get onto the pitch. We want to make them happy, so we just try to use their energy that they give us and try to give our best.”",
      "Mbeumo is clearly determined not to get carried away with United’s fine run of form. And the same goes for his manager.",
      "Apart from the odd moment or two, Carrick cuts a calm and composed figure in the technical area, despite the excitement of four victories on the spin. He is certainly no Pep Guardiola in his level of animation.",
      "Carrick explained: “I think it's just managing the moment. I'm not particularly thinking I need to look a certain way. I’m not into that. It's not a performance for me.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener against Spurs came from a slick short-corner routine(Image: Marc Atkins, Getty Images)",
      "“I think it helps make clear decisions. It’s trying to understand how the game's going on. There's certainly an emotional side, you know.",
      "“I’ve made myself look a little bit silly with some of the celebrations from certain goals that we've had, but that's part of football, and you've got to enjoy the moments at certain times. But there's definitely another bit of trying to be calm and thoughtful and calculate it at the right time as well.”",
      "His calm and thoughtful approach is certainly paying dividends and that is the way in which he is determined to carry on, saying: “We're not getting carried away. I'm certainly not thinking everything's great. We've cracked it, you know? There's a lot of work to do, so I'm fully aware of that.”",

It looked clever because it produced a goal, of course. It was fairly basic stuff, though, that was successful mainly because Spurs players somehow failed to see it coming or react.",
      "But those Spurs players were not the first - and won’t be the last - to be fooled by the excellence of Kobbie Mainoo. Somehow, they did not notice Mainoo nipping away from the front post to receive the kick before reversing a pass to Bryan Mbeumo that the United forward scuffed past Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "And that is Mainoo. So much of what he does well goes unnoticed. There is nothing flashy. He is undemonstrative.",
      "There is no finger-pointing, no arm-waving. He is no shrinking violet but he tends not to get involved in many spats.",
      "Among those who did not notice Mainoo’s strengths was Ruben Amorim. Either it was one of those inexplicable blind spots that a manager can have or Amorim saw something that he didn’t quite like.",
      "Because Mainoo would give midfield balance to any elite team. Reinstated to the team, Mainoo has been quietly efficient in Michael Carrick’s perfect four-game run.",
      "And what Carrick sees is the perfect combination of a 20-year-old still on a learning curve yet one already with invaluable experiences in his locker. Don’t forget, Mainoo started a European Championship final. He scored a goal in an FA Cup final.",
      "“There’s definitely more to come from him but he also has so much experience under his belt,” says Carrick. “He has experience of big occasions, big games, of pressurised situations. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go along.”",

      "While the likes of Bruno Fernandes has been outstanding in United’s resurgence, the midfield combination of Mainoo and Casemiro has been at the heart of the revival. The pair have been outstanding.",
      "“That is going to help him develop,” Carrick explains. “Playing next to Case, learning from him, learning things he’s probably not even realising he is picking up. I think that is just part of his journey to learn and develop.",
      "“He's at the stage he's at in his career when he's just starting out, essentially. But he’s come in, he's played four games, and he's found his rhythm.”",
      "And in only four games - the latest win courtesy of the Mbeumo goal and a late Fernandes effort, both after Cristian Romero’s first-half, game-changing red card - Carrick has already made a compelling case to be given the long-term manager’s job. Quite simply, he has transformed the mood at the club.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored Manchester United's opener against Spurs with Kobbie Mainoo providing the assist(Image: Marc Atkins, Getty Images)",

And it's difficult to comment in terms of what's changed. I'm pleased with the buy-in, with the connection. Everyone's invested in it. I think that goes a long way.",
      "“The game can flow in different ways and you can look very different, good or bad, but I think being in a really good emotional place helps you.”",
      "And right now, under Carrick, everyone at Old Trafford is certainly in a really good emotional place. Particularly Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Scott McTominay featured for Napoli this weekend(Image: Image Photo Agency, Getty Images)",
      "Scott McTominay experienced a rollercoaster of emotions during Napoli's 3-2 victory over Genoa on Saturday. The former Manchester United star scored an impressive goal for the Serie A champions, only to be sidelined by an injury at half-time.",
      "Napoli found themselves trailing after an early penalty but McTominay played a key role in levelling the score, with his shot rebounding for United loanee Rasmus Hojlund to tap home. The Scotland international then stole the show, scoring a spectacular long-range effort just two minutes later.",
      "However, the 29-year-old was withdrawn at half-time due to an injury, much to the dismay of manager Antonio Conte. Genoa equalised before the hour mark, capitalising on a defensive mistake, and Napoli's grip on the game seemed to be slipping when Juan Jesus was shown a red card with just 15 minutes left on the clock.",
      "In McTominay's absence, it was Hojlund who emerged as the hero, securing three points for his side with a last-minute penalty that slipped under the goalkeeper. After the match, Napoli's boss Conte gave an update on McTominay's injury.",
      "\"Scott has been dealing with this problem since the beginning of the year,\" he said. \"It's an inflammation of the tendons in the area between the gluteus maximus and the hamstrings. This discomfort forces him to play at a reduced pace.",
      "\"He would have continued, but at the end of the first half I preferred to avoid any stupid risks. We're talking about a key player for us, I need him to be 100%. We hope to get him back as soon as possible.\"",
      "Despite featuring for just 45 minutes, McTominay's impact proved crucial to a result that left Napoli six points adrift of Serie A leaders Inter Milan. Here's how the Italian press assessed the former United man's display.",
      "Praised for his involvement in Napoli's opening goal by \"Prince Rasmus\", McTominay received plaudits for \"a magnificent moral brace\". Il Napolista awarded the midfielder an eight out of 10.",
      "Antonio Conte addressed McTominay's injury(Image: Isabella BONOTTO / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "His willingness to play through injury drew comparisons to Braveheart. Wishing McTominay a swift return to fitness, the summary of his performance ended with the line: \"God save Scott McTominay.\"",
      "The Italian publication handed McTominay an eight for his efforts while playing through discomfort. Corriere dello Sport summed up the midfielder's character: \"When the going gets tough, he's always the toughest.\"",
      "His strike was described as \"beautiful\" and his overall performance was \"exceptional\". The way he continued to \"shoot, run and fight like hell\" saw him labelled the \"Rocky of football\".",
      "McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund were vital to Napoli's win over Genoa(Image: Isabella BONOTTO / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "This Italian outlet acknowledged that McTominay's fitness issues affected his performance. Il Messaggero characterised the team's key midfielder as \"not being at his best\", though they praised his determination to continue.",
      "Instead of highlighting his long-distance attempt, it was his contribution to Hojlund's equaliser that was noted as \"a precise right-footed shot\". He received a seven in the outlet's player ratings.",

      "Marcus Rashford has earned praise from Spanish media after seizing his chance in a rare league start for Barcelona. Hansi Flick's side stretched their advantage at the top of La Liga to four points following a 3-0 triumph over Mallorca at the Nou Camp.",
      "With Rafinha sidelined through injury, Rashford was given his first league start since January 3 and grasped the opportunity with both hands. Robert Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute after a Rashford shot was blocked.",
      "Lamine Yamal, finding the net for a fifth consecutive match, added a second just past the hour mark before fellow youngster Marc Bernal sealed the win with his maiden senior goal seven minutes from the final whistle.",
      "However, it was Rashford that garnered most of the plaudits from the media and supporters, who gave the on-loan Manchester United attacker a standing ovation when he was withdrawn midway through the second period.",
      "Mundo Deportivo described Rashford's display as \"hyperactive\" and commended him for energising Barca after a lethargic opening. They wrote: \"By far, one of Barca's most purposeful players in a first half that was collectively very flat.",
      "\"Taking Flick's challenge to heart, he assumed attacking responsibility when the game looked its worst, producing the most dangerous shots, the second leading to the 1-0 goal, and sending a beautiful free kick straight off the crossbar. Substituted to well-deserved applause.\"",
      "El Desmarque, referencing the side's sluggish opening, lauded both Rashford and Yamal for rousing Barca \"from their siesta\". AS also commended Rashford, while noting he enjoyed greater freedom compared to Yamal, who was \"constantly facing a three-on-one on the right flank\". They additionally observed that \"Rashford's form has improved throughout the season\".",
      "Rashford took his chance with both hands(Image: Josep LAGO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The Barca Universal website awarded Rashford an impressive 8.5/10 rating, stating: \"Rashford was perhaps Barcelona's most potent threat in the first half as he did not hesitate to cut in and shoot, creating a ruckus in the Mallorca area and bombarding Roman's goal with powerful strikes.",
      "\"He also did well providing a wide threat, although his crosses were well defended for the greater part. In fact, the opening goal stemmed from his shot on goal which fell kindly for Lewandowski.\"",
      "Rashford impressed both fans and media with his performance(Image: Pablo Rodriguez/Quality Sport Images/Getty Images)",
      "Football Espana weren't quite as generous with their marks, handing him a 7/10 while still delivering glowing praise: \"Barcelona's best attacker, and he can count himself unlucky that he did not find the back of the net with one of his ferocious strikes.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Barca Blaugranes suggested the Catalan giants stirred into life \"thanks in large part to Marcus Rashford, who was the brightest and most active of the Blaugrana attackers\".",

      "There are doubts over Bruno Fernandes's Manchester United future(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Bruno Fernandes has contributed a staggering sum in tax over the past year amid uncertainty over his Manchester United future. The club skipper, who pockets around £300,000 weekly, ranks among Britain's highest taxpayers.",
      "In the last 12 months alone, he's handed over approximately £9million to the Treasury, according to the recently published Sunday Times Tax List. His substantial earnings reflect his status as arguably United's most dependable performer throughout a turbulent period for the club, which has seen a succession of managers come and go.",
      "Reports suggest Fernandes has become weary of the constant turmoil, with fellow Portuguese Ruben Amorim becoming the latest manager to be axed. The midfielder has previously considered a switch to the Saudi Pro League, but rejected a move to the Gulf state last summer.",
      "Fresh offers are almost certain to arrive this summer, though supporters will be hoping the resurgence under Michael Carrick can persuade the 31-year-old to remain at Old Trafford. His contract runs until summer 2027, with a 12-month extension option. Yet the financial attractions of relocating to Saudi Arabia are clear.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Beyond the enormous wages on offer, footballers pay no tax on their income in the kingdom. This contrasts sharply with the 45 per cent levy on earnings above £125,000 in Britain.",
      "While he perhaps couldn't dream of matching Cristiano Ronaldo's eye-watering £3.74m weekly earnings, a pay packet hovering around the £1m mark wouldn't be unrealistic. Take Karim Benzema and Riyad Mahrez, for example, who both pocket more than £800,000 a week.",
      "Fernandes isn't even the biggest tax contributor at United. That is Casemiro, a player who's certain to depart the club come summer.",
      "Fernandes is likely to be in demand again this summer(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "The Brazilian midfielder commands a staggering £375,000 per week according to the Sunday Times list, which means he's forked out nearly £11m in tax over the past year.",
      "That places him as the third-highest taxpayer in British football, trailing only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (£17m) and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (£14.5m).",
      "Casemiro is getting ready to leave English football after contributing a huge amount to the public purse(Image: John Walton/PA Wire)",
      "Raheem Sterling, who recently parted ways with Chelsea by mutual agreement, contributed £9.8m in tax - £100,000 more than Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Fernandes matches City's Bernardo Silva on £9m. Topping the overall tax list was bookmaker Betfred, which handed over £400m to the Treasury. Music stars Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, along with boxer Anthony Joshua, also feature in the top 100.",

      "Michael Carrick has won each of his games in charge in his role as interim head coach so far, but West Ham are fighting for survival this season and will be tricky opponents in London.",
      "The Irons have won three of their last four games in the league. Their one defeat in that run came against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, which saw West Ham surrender a two-goal lead in the second half.",

      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "Again, there aren't many selection decisions for Carrick to make here. I certainly wouldn't be making any changes defensively and the back four that has impressed recently can go again.",
      "There will be a question mark over Casemiro, who has sometimes struggled when the games come thick and fast. The problem is that Manuel Ugarte is a significant drop-off from the Brazilian. I'd take the risk with Casemiro and hope his legs hold out before an 11-day break.",
      "One player who deserves a start is Benjamin Sesko. He has made an impact as a sub and this game looks ideal to bring him in. I would take Amad out, purely because Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked a little more threatening in front of goal.",
      "Tyrone's team",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Carrick will surely be tempted to pick another unchanged starting XI after a fourth win on the bounce, but I would make two changes to the team: Ugarte for Casemiro and Sesko for Amad.",
      "The Ugarte selection may be controversial, but Casemiro was really poor against Burnley at the beginning of January because he'd started two games in the space of four days. I'd pick the Brazilian if there was a guarantee he could perform, but his inclusion would mean another two starts in four days.",
      "Ugarte should benefit from coming into a team playing with confidence. The Sesko decision doesn't need much explaining because he deserves a start after a positive spell. Mbeumo simply can't be dropped and Amad has played more football than Cunha, so he should move to the bench.",
      "Steven's team",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "United may have a limited number of matches this season and plenty of players deserve their chance to feature, but with momentum as high as it is right now Carrick must stick with what is working best. There is a slight concern about starting Casemiro considering the tight turnaround.",
      "However, the Reds have a long break after this one due to being out of the FA Cup so the Brazilian has plenty of time to recuperate after this fixture before they take on Everton. Mbeumo remains the obvious choice at the top of the pitch.",
      "Carrick's side look better when he is leading the line. Sesko can offer a different headache for the Hammers if called upon from the bench.",

      "Manchester United have enjoyed a brilliant start to life under Michael Carrick and after masterminding a victory over one of his ex-clubs in Tottenham on Saturday he will look to repeat the trick at West Ham tonight. The short turnaround after the win at Old Trafford opens up some questions over rotation.",
      "Keeping Kobbie Mainoo in the starting line-up seems a must if United want to continue their good form. Since his recall, he has not missed a beat and against Spurs he was brilliant linking play through the middle.",
      "There could be a temptation to bring Leny Yoro into the starting XI in place of Harry Maguire should the experienced centre-back need a rest but the preference would be to keep the back four the same.",

      "The big debate will be whether to rest Casemiro for this fixture. United's problem is they do not have another player in their squad who can perform the defensive midfield duty better or to the same level as Casemiro. Manuel Ugarte would be the obvious replacement but the Fulham game showed how the Reds can lose control of a game without the Brazilian on the pitch.",
      "For that reason, keeping Casemiro in the starting XI is likely to be Carrick's preferred choice. The interim boss will be hoping the 33-year-old can get through this game ahead of an extended rest before facing Everton on February 23.",
      "Moving into the attack is where United could change things up. Matheus Cunha will stay on the left flank seen as though Patrick Dorgu remains unavailable.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has to start for United but could be moved on to the right wing to allow Amad a rest. This then allows Benjamin Sesko an opportunity to provide Carrick with a headache.",
      "Sesko deserves a shot at further minutes due to his impressive form since Ruben Amorim left and with a lack of fixtures between now and the end of the season, Carrick could decide tonight is the time to give him a run out from the start.",

      "\"If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck.\"",
      "Michael Carrick talks and carries himself like a Manchester United manager. He has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham since his interim appointment. Carrick has outfoxed Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta during that run, while getting the better of Marco Silva and Thomas Frank, two managers who United considered hiring in 2024.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The 45-year-old has earned a reputation as one of the most articulate pundits in the business, and believes it would be a no-brainer for United to give Carrick the job if he steers the club into the Champions League.",
      "\"I don’t see how you couldn’t give it to him,\" said Hargreaves. \"What would have been the point of working that hard? You can get elite managers in, but that doesn't guarantee success.",
      "\"What Michael’s doing is very impressive. The fans are happy, which is important. The players are happy and that’s important, but the most important thing is that the team wins.",
      "\"United have had big-name managers on the bench. They had two of the greatest in the last 10 years, up there with Pep and Ancelotti: Van Gaal and Mourinho. A huge name comes with more expectation.\"",
      "Carrick received support from matchgoers even before his appointment was formalised. His name was sung at Turf Moor when Darren Fletcher was caretaker, and \"it's Carrick, you know, hard to believe it's not Scholes\" was aired by fans after the victory over Tottenham last weekend.",
      "United sources have insisted that nobody is getting carried away. Carrick has played down questions about his future, but Hargreaves believes he would be worthy of landing the job permanently.",
      "He said: \"I’ve known Michael for 24 years. I played with him for 21. He’s not a 'me' guy. He’ll ask, 'What’s the solution? How can I make him play better?' He’s good with people. He’ll put players in positions to succeed. He’s got Bruno, the best creator in the division. Kobbie is back in the team.",
      "\"Casemiro playing as the six. Everybody’s in a good spot. The back four is super good. Every player is playing different roles compared to before. Wing-backs are full-backs. Centre-backs went from a three to a two. Midfield two is now a three. Tens playing wide or as strikers.",
      "\"Even Bryan Mbeumo has played on the right or as a 10. To change that many players with no pre-season and still make the team function — I don’t see how you couldn’t give him the job.",
      "\"You know what it’s like when it’s not good and when everyone’s happy, and you’re winning. Why stop that just to bring in a name? If you could get Luis Enrique, obviously. But the only thing going against Carrick is experience. The most important thing is the team functions, and it is functioning well.",
      "\"Pep got an opportunity as a young coach and took it. Zidane got an opportunity and did remarkable things with Madrid. Everyone said 'young coach', but he needed an opportunity. He ran with it. If Carrick finishes third or fourth, I don’t see how you don’t follow it through.\"",
      "\"He’s been faultless. Even his subs have been great. The starting XI looks good, everyone looks settled,\" added Hargreaves. \"Michael has done a good job of finding solutions and not being rigid. I don’t understand when we got into this position where every manager says, 'This is how I play and I’m not going to change it.' Why? I never played in a game of football that looked the same. I never played in two games that looked the same.",
      "\"So why would I always have the same plan or formation? Against Tottenham, there was so much rotation. Players popped up in different positions. Bruno was rotating all over the place. Shaw was pushing high. Casemiro was dropping between the centre-backs. Players found solutions out there and weren’t wedded to one style.\"",
      "Carrick has given fans something to smile about.(Image: MI News/NurPhoto)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been at the centre of Carrick's success since his appointment. The youngster was left in the cold during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Carrick has made Mainoo integral to his plans. He has rewarded Carrick's faith in him by delivering four excellent performances.",
      "\"I’ve never seen him have a bad game. That’s mad for a young kid,\" said Hargreaves. \"He didn’t play for a year and walked into the two hardest games in the league. Kobbie’s a ball player. He’s not going to win loads of tackles but can do enough, especially with who he plays with.",
      "\"If I were a coach, I’d think: 'I’ve got this kid and a guy who’s won so many Champions Leagues. He probably needs another hand.' Imagine Kobbie in between that. Kobbie is elite in terms of being able to pass anywhere.",
      "\"I mentioned at the weekend - not comparing George Best to Kobbie - but talking about the Munich Air Disaster and the Busby Babes, and George Best coming through shortly after and winning a European trophy. This club is built on promoting academy players. Look at The Class of 92', then Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Scott McTominay, and now Kobbie.",
      "\"After not playing for a year, to play as he has - I don’t know many players in the world who could do that. He’s not doing loads of interviews, not too up or down. Just a great player. I’m so happy for him because he deserves it.\"",
      "Mainoo has not played for England since starting in the Euro 2024 final against Spain, but he could force himself back into the squad for the World Cup if he maintains his current form.",
      "Mainoo is back to his best.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Harry Maguire is another United player with hope of representing the Three Lions this summer. The defender has been excellent alongside Lisandro Martinez, however, Maguire will not be a United player by the World Cup if an agreement is not reached over a new contract with his current deal expiring in the summer.",
      "\"From a leadership standpoint, if you want to defend your box as they did in the first two games, which you have to because teams have gone more old school, then Harry’s one of the best at that,\" said Hargreaves.",
      "\"He’s got a partner in Martinez who can play. All the great Premier League teams started with a centre-back partnership: United with Bruce and Pallister, Vidic and Ferdinand; Chelsea with Terry and Carvalho; Arsenal with Adams, and Liverpool too. Look at Arsenal now with Gabriel and Saliba.",
      "\"It’s all built on that. Since they’ve gone to a back four, that’s perfect. One of the biggest mistakes United made when things started to go wrong in the transfer market was losing leadership.",
      "\"They lost so many leaders within a few years: Van der Sar, Gary Neville, Rio, Vidic, Evra, Scholes, Giggs, Rooney, Ronaldo. You can sign players all you like, but they lost leadership.",
      "\"You only really know players when it’s difficult. Other than Bruno, they didn’t have enough leaders. With Harry’s leadership and everything he’s been through, he can mentor younger players. I hope he stays. Credit to him for how he’s come through and kept playing well.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's time as Manchester United manager didn't produce many highlights but undoubtedly one of the darkest days of his tenure came when Everton visited Old Trafford last November. The Reds fell to a 1-0 defeat against Everton despite playing against ten men for all but 13 minutes of the match.",
      "The negative 3-4-2-1 system was under scrutiny and proved it could not unlock a side that would definitely have taken a point as soon as they were reduced to 10 men.",
      "Unbelievably the Toffees secured all three points and less than two months on Amorim was sacked. Last weekend, United once again found themselves up against 10 men with the game goalless. Where Amorim failed, Michael Carrick succeeded.",

      "MEN Sport has taken a look back at the Everton defeat and highlighted five ways Carrick's tactics trumped Amorim's when tasked with breaking down a side who had seen a man sent off.",
      "Amorim always justified the decision to play Bruno Fernandes deeper in midfield because he wanted United to have more control in the centre of the pitch.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "However, that tweak saw Kobbie Mainoo drop out and it is clear to see that Mainoo needs to be in the team. Everton's winner came from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall running off Fernandes before Leny Yoro failed to stop the shot.",
      "Against Spurs, and since the arrival of Carrick, Fernandes has moved into attacking midfield and he has been excellent, as has Mainoo since being brought back in from the cold.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been excellent under Michael Carrick",
      "Rewatching the Everton game was painful for plenty of reasons, particularly because of how predictable United were. It was difficult for Amorim's side when playing a team with a goal advantage and the ability to sit on the edge of their area, but the Reds made it way too easy for them.",
      "United would play the ball out to Amad in the hope he could produce a moment of magic, but with Everton doubling up on him he would have to work it back and eventually the attack broke down. It was dull and uninspiring.",
      "In contrast, United switched up their attack against Tottenham, with the first goal a perfect example. Matheus Cunha did well to drift inside and create overloads in the centre, a move that ultimately won the corner from which the first goal came.",
      "A neat training ground routine allowed the ball to be laid off for Bryan Mbeumo to slot home. It seems simple but it is by far a better brand of football to watch.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo slots home the opener for Manchester United against Tottenham",
      "This goes hand-in-hand with the predictable nature of Amorim's system but the tempo in the defeat to Everton was shockingly low. When Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Old Trafford was rocking and hopeful of seeing their side take advantage.",
      "Instead, United killed that urgency with slow play which made it easy for Everton to defend. The Reds were too casual in possession and this created problems with passes being intercepted and clearances being made.",
      "Now, there is a sharpness to United's play that is not just evident against ten men. Carrick's side pass the ball around with a crispness and some of the one-touch football left Spurs scratching their heads at the weekend.",
      "Bafflingly, United were so defensive against Everton you would have thought they were the ones with ten men. A particular example of this was their approach to defending long throws.",
      "The Reds put all 11 men behind the ball, including Joshua Zirkzee. When they eventually cleared the danger, there was nobody upfield to offer a way out and Everton were able to just recycle possession.",
      "Against Tottenham, that was not the case and this allowed United to retain more control. Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez have forged a solid partnership in recent weeks and that gives United the confidence to leave a man upfield without the fear of conceding.",
      "When United eventually managed to work an opening against Everton they looked to get crosses into the box. Not a bad strategy except for a couple of key issues.",
      "Bruno Fernandes fires home Manchester United's second against Tottenham",
      "Firstly, there was no variation on the crosses, with all being looping balls that Michael Keane and James Tarkowski took pleasure in just heading away. On the few occasions they were beaten, Zirkzee forced a couple of good saves from Jordan Pickford.",
      "However, there were also too many occasions when Zirkzee and other forwards were not bursting into the box to try and get on the end of crosses. The combination of the two was a recipe for disaster.",
      "Now, United are showing a variation in their crosses and the second against Spurs came thanks to a brilliant delivery from Diogo Dalot which Benjamin Sesko was trying to reach.",

It extended the former midfielder's record in the job to six wins and a draw from seven games, having stood in as caretaker for three matches in November 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked.",
      "During that run, Fernandes told Carrick that he thought he would make a great manager. Now back at Old Trafford, he is proving that prophecy right. United are conducting what they describe as a \"thorough process\" to appoint their next head coach and although Carrick is refusing to get carried away, he is putting himself in the frame.",
      "Asked about Fernandes' comments ahead of the trip to West Ham, he insisted there was more to achieve this season before any thoughts turn to staying on.",

It's obviously nice when players that you respect, as I do with Bruno a lot, say good things about you, but ultimately it's about the team, getting the best out of the team, and actually that's all working together.",
      "\"So time will tell. It's not about judging how good or successful at this moment in time, because nothing's really happened yet. We've hopefully got a lot more to do between now and the end of the season, and see what happens after that.\"",

      "Despite his cool persona, Carrick is trying to enjoy the highs of winning and ride the emotion that comes with those successes, but he knows there is more to do if United are to return to the Champions League next season.",
      "\"It's a really easy thing to say, and listen, part of it, you've got to enjoy the buzz of winning. That's what we're in it for,\" he said.",
      "\"You've got to manage the highs of it and you've got to enjoy initially the feeling of winning a game. You can't just be flat-lined the whole time, but certainly going into the next game, you've got to then regroup and prepare again for what's next.",

      "\"But you've still got to allow yourself to feel the little bits and waves of emotion with it. It’s all a little bit boring and pointless if you didn't really to be honest, winning games is what we're all striving for.\"",

      "Michael Carrick knows what is at stake for one Manchester United fan on Tuesday night",
      "One Manchester United fan will be hoping his side's trip to the London Stadium on Tuesday is anything but a close shave, with a first haircut in nearly 500 days resting on the outcome of the game.",
      "Frank Ilett vowed not to get a trim until United won five games in a row in October 2024 and his wild locks have grown out of control since then, with the troubles under Ruben Amorim meaning he's not even gone close to seeing a pair of scissors.",
      "United only once managed to win three in a row under Amorim, but the appointment of Michael Carrick has led to a change in fortunes and Ilett is now 90 minutes away from booking in with the barber.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "His stance has won him more than one million followers on social media and it hasn't been popular with all United supporters, who see him feeding off a difficult era for the club. Tuesday will be day 493 since Frank last had a haircut but victory for United will put an end to his mammoth challenge and Carrick admits he is aware of the ongoing saga, mostly thanks to his children.",
      "Carrick's priority is strengthening United's grip on a Champions League place rather than landing a fan a haircut and he joked the story wouldn't be making it into the team talk at the London Stadium.",
      "\"I can say I'm aware of it, yeah,\" said Carrick. \"My kids have made me aware of it, if anything, but it certainly won't go into the team talk from a professional level, but I can understand what's going on with it and it does make me smile but it won't have an impact ultimately in the end.\"",

      "Frank is hoping United can get the job done on Tuesday now that the scissors are in sight and he will be tuning into the game to see how it goes.",
      "“Carrick is at the wheel, this hair is going soon, West Ham next, four out of five done – this is the first time it’s been four in a row since I started the challenge,\" he said.",
      "“This time it’s happening! Thank you so much to Carrick – thank you, thank you, thank you.\"",

      "Sandro Tonali pictured at Old Trafford.(Image: 2024 Newcastle United)",
      "Newcastle star Sandro Tonali is a player Manchester United admire as the Reds head into a summer transfer window in which they will look to overhaul their midfield. Casemiro will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season and United will need to sign a replacement.",
      "Tonali is contracted at St. James' Park until the summer of 2029, with the option of an additional year. Newcastle are thought to value the midfielder in the region of £100million.",
      "The 25-year-old is understood to be on a long list of midfielders being monitored by United. The Reds considered a move for Brighton man Carlos Baleba last summer, while Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have also been tracked.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Tonali's representatives spoke to Arsenal in the January transfer window. Newcastle are 12th in the Premier League this season, and Eddie Howe is facing the prospect of losing some of his best players.",
      "The midfielder's agent recently spoke to Italian media and said his client's future was uncertain. \"Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League. We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer,\" Giuseppe Riso said.",
      "\"These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do. There’s no preference at the moment. It’s still early.",
      "\"What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow. Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point in moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.”",
      "In November, Tonali said he was \"happy\" at Newcastle, but he was reluctant to commit his long-term future to the club, and admitted all players must consider their future options.",
      "Tonali has been repurposed as a No.6 at Newcastle, despite initially playing as a No.8 after his £55m arrival from AC Milan in the summer of 2023. Shortly after Tonali's arrival in the north east, he was banned from playing football for 10 months for breaching Italian betting regulations.",
      "Where Tonali's long-term future lies has made headlines. Pep Guardiola spoke warmly about Tonali before Manchester City's game against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup semi-final, and the Catalan was spotted speaking to him on the Etihad pitch after City's comfortable win.",
      "Arsenal were linked with a dramatic late move for Tonali in the final days of the winter window after Mikel Merino suffered a broken foot which required surgery. Newcastle denied any contact with Arsenal.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been brilliant since returning to the Manchester United team",
      "It is set to be the year of the midfield at Manchester United. If 2025 was all about revamping the attack, the focus this summer is going to fall on the centre of the pitch. United will target two new midfielders this summer, with one tasked with replacing Casemiro, who will leave at the end of the season when his contract expires.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is also likely to move on and there is every chance the midfield options available to whoever the head coach is at the start of the 2026/27 season will look a lot different to now.",
      "But six weeks ago, there was a fear that the entire midfield might need to be rebuilt. Bruno Fernandes had thrust his own future back into the news and Kobbie Mainoo's chances of playing under Ruben Amorim looked as distant as ever.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes now looks happy and settled again and Champions League football would surely convince the club captain to stay on, while no player has had a bigger transformation under Michael Carrick than Mainoo.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The academy graduate is not only back in the team, but looking like the player who enjoyed a spectacular breakthrough in the second half of the 2023/24 season. For all the talk of United signing a £100million midfielder this summer, Mainoo's recent form is a reminder they might already have one on their hands. He was the best player on the pitch in Saturday's win against Tottenham.",
      "“There's definitely more to come from him, and that's just the age he's at, the stage he's at in his career. He’s just starting out, essentially,\" Carrick said after watching Mainoo run the show.",
      "“He’s got so much experience under his belt of big occasions, big games, and pressurised situations. That's going to help him develop and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up, just playing next to him as well as the other players around him.",
      "“I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop. As I said, I'm really conscious that he's come in, he's played the four games, and he's found his rhythm. Young players will have times when they're up, and then they might have a little dip, that's not all of a sudden, he's good, or he's a poor player. Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that's really important, especially for younger players, and understanding that. So he's done fantastic at the moment. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go.”",
      "The irony of that is that Mainoo is actually one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, as he is still on the contract he signed as a 17-year-old in February 2023. His return to the starting XI has again triggered bonuses, but that still leaves him short of many of his teammates.",
      "Now that he is back in the fold, there is a desire to fix that. United never had any intention of letting their prized academy graduate leave and now they will show him how much he is valued by opening talks over a new deal, with the hope they can be concluded by the end of the season.",
      "That would be a significant boost ahead of the summer. On this form, Mainoo is one of the first names on the teamsheet, and with Fernandes as the starting No.10, there is only one spot left to fill in the strongest team. It is easy to imagine someone like Elliot Anderson coming in and finishing off that midfield trio.",
      "Whatever business United end up doing this summer, securing a new contract for Mainoo might be the best of it. He is the poster boy for the academy in recent years, as well as a brilliant footballer when shown the faith that Carrick has given him in recent weeks.",
      "He is also only 20 and there is clearly more to come, as Carrick explained on Saturday. This is a player who started the European Championship final at 18, and he should be part of United's midfield for years to come. Giving him a contract that reflects that status is now crucial.",
      "Mainoo has just over a year left on his existing deal, with the option of another 12 months, but United know he needs a new contract. If that is signed and sealed before the summer, then it will be one significant piece of business completed before the window opens.",

      "There was a wealth of scepticism in the air when the 44-year-old arrived at Old Trafford last month. United fans were well within their right, of course, given that he was only sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer for guiding the club to a lacklustre 10th place finish in the Championship standings in 2024/25.",

      "Ben Jacobs has claimed that United view the forward as an option to bolster their attack. He told The United Stand: \"Manchester United really like Anthony Gordon as well as a potential option, especially knowing that the player actually relishes the chances to have more game time through the centre as a number nine as well.

      "The goals came after Spurs were reduced to 10 men in the first half. Captain Cristian Romero was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Casemiro, with United able to make their numerical advantage count.",

      "\"He played Bruno (Fernandes) and (Matheus) Cunha as two 10s or two false nines, whatever you'd want to say. He moved (Bryan) Mbeumo, who's been playing centre-forward, out to the left, and Amad was on the right.",
      "\"What it did with two intelligent players like these two, it gave the Tottenham centre-halves a real problem, saying do we go in and follow them, or do we drop off? Does the midfield three, any two of the three Tottenham players drop in?",
      "\"This is the first minute, look at the space that Bruno has got, he's playing some of the best football of his career and surely the game-plan was to try and stop him getting on the ball. That's an early warning.",
      "\"Here, one coming to feet, into space, the other one, no one picking him up. As I said, they're talented boys, really special footballers, but you have to set a plan to stop the best players.",

      "Michael Carrick has given Manchester United a new lease of life(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may just be four matches into an interim head coaching stint with Manchester United, but he has already shown up the failures that Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim managed in their disastrous time in charge during the 2024/25 season.",
      "There was a wealth of scepticism in the air when the 44-year-old arrived at Old Trafford last month. United fans were well within their right, of course, given that he was only sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer for guiding the club to a lacklustre 10th place finish in the Championship standings in 2024/25.",
      "Meanwhile, Carrick's caretaker role with the club following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November 2021 lasted less than a month before he was replaced by Ralf Rangnick.",
      "During his initial stint at the helm, Carrick achieved two wins and a draw from a total of three matches before he announced his shock decision to depart after a win against Arsenal and be replaced by the German - with Ten Hag taking up tenure at the end of 2021/22. What ensued next was two years of rot and questionable choices with an FA Cup trophy lift thrown in before the Dutchman was ultimately given the boot in October 2024, with Amorim left to pick up the pieces.",
      "The Portuguese tactician failed to restore any glory to the Theatre of Dreams in his first season in charge, finishing a lowly 15th in the Premier League standings and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur - albeit, mainly utilising a squad he inherited from his predecessor.",
      "Giving Amorim the benefit of the doubt, the board backed him in the summer transfer window and afforded him a full pre-season schedule to play with to fine-tune his team. And while Amorim was handed a sizeable budget to bring in the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens, the 41-year-old never really managed to get the best out of his new arrivals.",
      "That's largely down to Amorim being insistent on favouring a failing 3-4-2-1 formation, utilising Amad as a wing-back when he clearly thrives in an attacking role, and dropping Bruno Fernandes deeper into the heart of the engine room alongside Casemiro, despite the skipper proving time and time again he is the club's most valuable asset in the pocket.",
      "A decision to drop Kobbie Mainoo, meanwhile, rubbed a number of fans the wrong way, especially given how fruitful the England international had been in the engine room prior to his arrival.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "And that's not to mention his public fallout with Marcus Rashford, pushing away perhaps one of the club's most talented all-time academy products, who left on a short-term deal to Aston Villa and has since gone on to thrive in a season-long loan with Barcelona when he could have been doing the business at Old Trafford instead.",
      "On the flipside, Carrick has not only managed to forge promising relationships with his squad in such a short space of time, but has also been able to do something that not Amorim nor Ten Hag, nor Solskjaer nor Jose Mourinho, Louis van Gaal or David Moyes could; get United back to running like the finely-tuned machine it was under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "You can see that there's an air of fresh start fever around Old Trafford at present, revamping it into a genuine Theatre of Dreams as of late compared to the one of nightmares it has been for the past 13 or so years since Fergie's retirement.",
      "That opinion is backed further by the fact that United have now eclipsed their Premier League points season tally from last season, currently sitting fourth in the standings and on the brink of European qualification with 44 points to the 42 that Amorim and Ten Hag managed in 2024/25.",
      "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United in January(Image: PA)",
      "To add further food for thought, there are still 13 matches remaining in the current campaign, meaning United could potentially bag a further 39 points by season's end, should Carrick's undefeated form continue to burn bright. Such events coming to fruition would put the Reds on a staggering total of 83 points - just one less than Liverpool achieved to win the title last time out.",
      "Let's not get carried away, with the form that Arsenal are in at present, it would take some form of divine intervention to see Mikel Arteta bottle the club's first league title in more than two decades. But if United could achieve even seven or eight wins from their remaining fixtures it should be enough to seal qualification to the Champions League.",
      "Given the collapse of relationships have been a key factor in underwhelming seasons for United as of late - from Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho's falling out with Amorim to Cristiano Ronaldo's alarming spat with Ten Hag - it's vital that Carrick is able to keep his players content going forward, win, lose or draw.",
      "If he's able to do so, the future certainly looks bright for the Wallsend-born coach, who could even be awarded permanent tenure this summer for his achievements. While there have been calls from pundits and fans alike for United to consider a more-seasoned head coach when Carrick's interim role concludes, it's hard to see past the Englishman given his form at present.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“Robin is a great manager, but he’s struggling a little bit at Feyenoord at the moment. I feel like the expectations for him are very high because of the career he had, so he’s under the spotlight a lot more than other managers in the Eredivisie.",
      "“He’s under fire over here in Holland at the moment, but I hope he’s given time to rectify it and prove how good he is.",

They said they’ve actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",

      "There are all manner of different categories here. Some of these managers are sh*t, some are over-promoted, some are clearly still in what is for now nominally a Premier League job in the hope they’ll do a good job in the Championship next season, some just happened to be in the right place at the right time when the job was being dished out.",
      "And some of them are Thomas Frank, who is almost all of the above but don’t tell the UK press boys that because he is like Bambi to those lads for some reason.",
      "To be entirely clear from the outset: while some of these managers are absolutely here for being sh*t, many of these managers are very good managers doing very good jobs. They just find themselves in positions their CVs from a year ago couldn’t possibly justify.",
      "",
      "He’s had quite the managerial career already at 43. Took Luton into the Premier League, which was crazy, then took them back out of it, which was fair enough, then had them well on their way to League One (crazy again) before being removed.",
      "You kind of felt he was always coming back to the Premier League one way or another, but it did probably need more than being quite good for a few months with Middlesbrough.",
      "He got himself the cushiest Premier League gig imaginable; taking over a team already doomed to relegation that won’t get pinned on you, and a situation where you are almost guaranteed to improve things.",
      "This he has duly done by collecting six points in 14 games. Obviously appointed with next season in mind, which is fair enough but history does suggest that while it’s fair to assume he will get Wolves out of the Championship, which direction is a 50-50 chance.",
      "",
      "A slightly harsher version of the ‘only here for next season’ trope, because Parker did at least earn his way into the Premier League with Burnley. And he has a proven Championship track record now.",

      "We all know that players exist who are too good for the Championship but nowhere near it in the Premier League, so it stands to reason it should apply to managers as well. Which could make for an interesting career, permanently either becoming a victim of your own success or rewarded for your own failure.",
      "",
      "It’s probably fair enough that consistent punching above weight at a smaller club should eventually earn a manager a crack at a big job.",
      "But it’s also fair enough that when, after just a few months, it’s clear that a) the job has overwhelmed you and you are drowning in your own nonsense and that b) the smaller club have carried on punching quite merrily without you, it’s time to agree that, sure, it was worth finding out, but find out we have and let’s bring an end to the whole thing.",
      "When it’s been eight months and that manager is actively propelling the big club towards relegation, then it is definitely time.",

He wouldn’t have learned any lessons from it either, sure, but he would have P45ed this small-timing, out-of-his-depth, anti-football-enjoying fraud into the shadow realm months ago and Spurs would now be becalmed and miserable but safe in 11th under the club-understanding interim eye of Ryan Mason.",

That’s not to knock the (for now) interim manager, but it’s increasingly clear with every passing moment that refusing to pick Kobbie Mainoo for reasons that were small and twatty should have been enough alone to have Amorim sacked and probably deemed in breach of contract for gross negligence.",
      "Carrick has done brilliantly, even if the real quiz comes if/when he’s handed the permanent job, but none of that alters the fact that United would not have looked at the former Middlesbrough manager twice were it not for his storied Old Trafford playing career.",

      "Andrews, clearly, has the right stuff and is doing a wonderful job. But the credentials with which he got that job remain staggeringly slight. Brentford deserve huge credit for the lemonade they have made from life’s lemons, but it really was a monumental gamble to entrust their Premier League survival to a man who had never managed a single game of senior football and had only even been a Premier League coach for a single season, working as Thomas Frank’s set-piece coach.",

      "",
      "We wonder if defeat to a 15th-placed Tottenham side sliding into a relegation battle after two wins in 16 games might be enough for Eddie Howe to believe he is in fact not the right man for the job after insisting he would “step aside” if he believed that to be the case.",
      "Aston Villa and Liverpool are acceptable defeats, Brentford at St James’ Park less so; add that run of three losses to another one against Thomas Frank’s Tottenham and most of the remaining #HoweIn Toon fans would surely turn against a manager who undoubtedly has a difficult job in manoeuvring a shallow squad to compete on what was four fronts until last week, but is also definitely now failing to get anything close to the best out of the vast majority of his players.",
      "The tide Howe is fighting against has already swept Frank out to sea. Are there any Tottenham fans who still want him to manage their team? At some point soon they will stop feeling angry and start feeling sympathy for a man arguably the worst football club to be told ‘you’re out of your depth’ at: one that purports to be Big with neither the back catalogue of successes nor the player quality to make it so.",

      "Four wins from four in the Premier League, through to the Champions League last 16 after getting the better of one of the old-guard Chelsea managers, Cole Palmer back and breaking records, it’s going about as well as it could have done for Liam Rosenior. Even his negative, ineffective tactics in defeat to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final were reported by many as a masterstroke that wasn’t.",
      "Enzo Maresca will be among the critics looking at a run of Brentford, Crystal Palace, West Ham and Wolves and brushing off the winning as a par score – although Chelsea drew with Brentford and Palace under the Italian earlier in the season – and likely view upcoming clashes against Leeds and Burnley with similar disdain.",
      "Leeds are a vastly different proposition at home than they are away – Daniel Farke’s have picked up 22 of their 29 points at Elland Road this season – granting the Rosenior naysayers further opportunity to scoff should Chelsea beat them at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.",
      "But the 3-1 defeat to the Whites at the start of December was maybe the low point of Maresca’s reign. As Gary Neville said on a night when Maresca rang the changes to his cost, Chelsea were “beaten up” and looked to lack anything close to the “character” – maybe the Rosenior buzzword – that they’ve shown in spades under the new manager.",

      "Dyche is now facing the wrath of a group of fans, the majority of whom didn’t want him in the first place,  who didn’t take kindly to the stark difference in vibe felt between their football club and Leeds after Farke’s side brushed them aside last time out.",
      "Growing frustration will surely turn to all-out mutiny should they fail to beat rock-bottom Wolves at home on Wednesday and grant Evangelos Marinakis an opportunity to appoint his fourth permanent manager of the season which we fully expect him to grasp with both hands.",

      "We find ourselves agreeing with Owen Hargreaves more than most pundits these days – certainly the ones with a Manchester United bent -and couldn’t think of any specific retorts to his claim that he’s “never seen Mainoo have a bad game”.",
      "He got a tad carried away in then suggesting the 20-year-old is some sort of George Best regen, but we’re happy to excuse his excesses as we too often fail to avoid hyperbole when watching the Red Devils academy graduate glide across the pitch as he has done since Prince Carrick arrived to break him from the dungeon master’s chains.",
      "What a fool Ruben Amorim is. And our frustration in him denying Mainoo football will turn to fury if he’s ruined his chances of appearing for England at the World Cup. Here’s hoping his performances continue to be at a level where Thomas Tuchel – for all of his faith in the tried and tested players for England – has no choice but to select him.",
      "West Ham’s Mateus Fernandes will provide a decent test, but we fully expect Mainoo to stroll through the game as he has done with all others.",

      "Newcastle United are said to be ‘well-placed’ to re-sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest in the summer, but the reality is very different…",
      "Newcastle‘s recent transfer activity is proof that money can’t buy you happiness, with Eddie Howe’s side derailed by Profit & Sustainability rules and their superior Premier League rivals in recent months.",
      "Their 2025 summer transfer window was shambolic from start to finish, with the prolonged Alexander Isak setting the tone for an incredibly frustrating few months.",
      "Wantaway Isak lingered around like a bad smell until deadline day, with the Magpies risking missing out on a remarkable full XI of potential signings before overpaying to sign Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa.",
      "And the 2026 summer transfer window risks being equally traumatic for Newcastle, who could be left searching for a new manager and replacements for several key players.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: ‘Angry’ Howe in busy sack race while Arsenal force more rule changes",
      "Howe has commented on potentially “stepping down” as Newcastle have only won one of their last nine games, while it is looking increasingly likely that Sandro Tonali is going to leave after his agent clearly tried to get him a move in January.",
      "But former Premier League chief executive Keith Wyness foolishly thinks Newcastle are ‘well-placed to agree a deal’ to re-sign Anderson to replace Tonali in a ‘sensational twist’.",
      "“Well that’s exactly it, it’s having that succession plan ready now in terms of midfield, but you know I think that they’re actually pretty well-placed [to sign Anderson],” Wyness told Football Insider.",
      "“It’d be surprising what they might have to pay to bring Elliot Anderson back having filled that gap. But again, they’re stuck in this whole vice we talked about last week of the SCR formulas and the ability to spend, despite having the richest owners in the world. It’s all been rehearsed and talked about so much, and it seems so unfair.",
      "“But yes, they’ve got to find that midfield solution now. This is why clubs don’t like players moving in January. It does give them this period now to do the research and to get some time in.",
      "“But, I think that certainly if he was to go, at the right price, I think Newcastle and Eddie Howe wouldn’t mind actually refreshing the squad and the ages in that midfield and get things moving again.",
      "“They’ve still got some work to do in that squad in Newcastle, certainly I think at both ends of the pitch and in the midfield. So I think that that would be something they need to address. But I think they’ve got to start thinking about life without Tonali for sure.”",

I’ve read conclusions, mailboxes, and Lewis Oldham’s recent piece – all rightly praising Carrick placing round pegs in round holes, but it’s much more impressive that just that. On top of deserved wins, they’ve been a quality watch too!",
      "The difference in on-the-ball style of play has been sensational. I was raised on early Wenger-era Arsenal, so I know well what entertaining football looks like, and this is it. I watch entire Utd matches a lot as most of my friends are fans. Recently I’ve enjoyed watching the calamity, but a strong and entertaining United is good for the league. Only crap part is now having to listen to your Nevilles and Ferdinands spout shite about it being Fergie’s blueprint (let the man go, lads).",
      "I mean, these fellas couldn’t knit three passes together under Amorim and were risk-averse and boring under Ten Hag. Even Ole’s counter-attacking group didn’t have the fluidity we’ve seen in the last three weeks, and relied heavily on a firing, motivated Rashford.",
      "The intensity and interchanging of Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno and Amad has opened new doors and new ideas. The incisive passing from the spine of this Utd team is clearly an instruction that brings a welcome risk-taking element that is now almost entirely absent from the City/Liverpool/Arsenal contingent who only appear to encourage creativity in the last 20 yards of the pitch. Seeing Maguire, Dalot, Casemiro (!) and Martinez play 1-2s out of the back and flick touches into the path of penetrating teammates has been brilliant.",
      "There’s an unpredictability about this group when they have the ball. Look at some of the chances they’ve created and one-touch football that’s been on show in the entire opposition half (and even their own half at times!). It’s fun, it’s exciting, it’s effective. It also gets the fans on your side. Best about it though is that the players who looked so shite under previous managers are now seemingly having more fun playing with less “structure”. If this continues, don’t be surprised if the players go to the top dogs and ask for him permanently. The thought of a Nagelsmann or otherwise being appointed to input their system on a group of players absolutely flying under a trusting manager might be met with a little derision.",

Firstly, the order of events: Szoboszlai fouls Haaland, the ref plays advantage and then Haaland fouls Szoboslai, so the goal is disallowed. Why did City then get the resulting free kick? Surely you don’t get a free hit on an opponent just because the ref has given you advantage? The second foul must be penalised, the game has continued.",
      "Also, it seems nuts, but don’t the laws of the game say Szoboszlai should have been cautioned, not sent off, because of the advantage:",
      "If the referee plays the advantage for an offence for which a caution/sending-off would have been issued had play been stopped, this caution/sending-off must be issued when the ball is next out of play. However, if the offence was denying the opposing team an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, the player is cautioned for unsporting behaviour; if the offence was interfering with or stopping a promising attack, the player is not cautioned.",

Then Liverpool should have had a free in the last 15 seconds, where they could’ve lumped it up-field to 10 men in the box, and dramatically cocked up a final chance to draw level.\nDave (this is what football analysis should be), Wigan",

      "I’m never slow to criticise officials and in particular the clowns when on VAR duty, but yesterdays Liverpool/City game highlighted some of the difficulties the actual laws of the game can hamper them. This is not sour grapes (it is partially) but my god that was one of the worst officiated games I’ve ever seen.",
      "Firstly, Silva’s tug on Salah’s shoulder, when is a foul not a foul? Neville says that Silva is “clever” as he doesn’t pull Salah for “too long”, or put another way, he fouls him but grets away with it. Don’t get me wrong, Liverpool players are just as guilty as any other team when it comes to this type of offence, Konate on Marmoush is less obvious but is in the realm, so just give them!, It’s the only way to (try and) cut them out. Trippiers pull on Potter was worse and yet the VAR, despite the shirt clearly being pulled, deems it “insignificant contact”!!!! To repeat my comment from a couple of weeks ago, show me the rule where it says a shirt pull is allowed and I’ll shut up about it.",
      "Guehi’s foul on Salah, correctly given outside the box but will Dias stop Salah getting a shot off, i.e. a goal scoring opportunity, he won’t, last season’s Salah scores, this season’s hits it with the outside of his foot and it goes closer to the corner flag than the goal, but it is still an opportunity.",
      "The penalty, it’s a penalty, some are claiming “but the ball is out of play”, again show me a rule that says you can wipe a player out after the ball has gone and I’ll agree, don’t give “a coming together” either, Alisson is late.",
      "Bernardo Silva, a wonderful player but is is there a more odious little shit in the game? Clearly Rodri’s cloak of invisibility has been passed to him. I was convinced he’d already been booked so was amazed to see him not sent off. His challenge on Kerkez sums up another massive flaw in the application or context of “the laws”.",
      "It’s as cynical a challenge as you will ever see, it’s not “endangering an opponent”, it’s not “reckless”, as such, a red card cannot be issued, but what it actually does is give City more than one advantage. It has broke up an attack. it wastes valuable seconds as the time to take the free kick will not be added on and it allows City to organise and set themselves for the free kick. red cards for this would again go some way to stopping them.",
      "Finally we have the biggest clusterf**k, the Cherki “goal”, how on earth is denying a goal scoring opportunity relevant when the ball goes in the net anyway, unfortunately for everyone, the laws of the game are applied correctly, almost, but the referee gives the goal, what happened to sticking with the on field decision? I’m pretty sure, but not certain, that “goals” have bee overruled and a penalty awarded, allowing the defending team an opportunity to stop a goal being scored, madness.",
      "I say almost as there was one element which was totally ignored! Haaland’s rugby tackle is a yellow card every time, Alisson is yellow carded for his challenge for the penalty yet Haaland is not, he’s not even late, he jumps on Szboszlai with no attempt to get to the ball (well he might be, but still).",
      "One commentor (btl really is filled with numpties) said that adding “the best part of quarter of an hour on”, was to give Liverpool more time, as they have conceded more “added on time” goals than anyone else, it’s hard to see how this was to their advantage.",
      "On the game itself, a draw felt like a fairer result, other than Haaland’s chance early on, Liverpool missed the “easier” chances with Ekitike’s header and Wirtz’s weak effort. I remember Semenyo blasting one high and wide and a decent shot from outside the box, but can’t recall Alissons other “saves” whereas Donnarumma’s is recalled by everyone, I know, “it’s his job” and that’s what the best keepers pull out.",

      "",
      "Surprised to see nothing here or anywhere else in regarding the foul from Reinildo on Gyokeres as he scored his second goal. Flying challenge above the knee with absolutely no hope of getting the ball. These only seem to be punished with a red if there is a big injury (like Isak’s leg break). A truly awful decision.",

It’s banter and brain farts and nonsense football club, and an air of Spurs shooting themselves in the foot at the 11th hour to the hilarity of everyone else. The reality isn’t as entertaining – it’s more slow and subtle…like the demise of Blockbuster and Nokia who didn’t see it coming.",
      "Whilst Spurs were never top of the tree in the same way those two were, they were doing ok. Go back 10 years, they’re toe to toe with Leicester in a crazy year. The year after they’re owning Liverpool, the year after that going unbeaten at The Lane. But this is where the lack of investment starts to creep in. The cloak of fiscal responsibility means they don’t sign a player in a calendar year. When they do take their hand off the cheque book, they absolutely soil themselves – they have no idea how to spend the money they’ve hoarded – Lo Celso and Ndombele were meant to be Mane and Firmino. The rot is setting in. The painful rebuild is never faced up too.",
      "Once Poch has gone, they get into a weird few years of never committing, fluctuating between big bastard names who demand money, and patsies. The ultimate of which is the current manager. At the time of writing Brentford are 500/1 to go down, Spurs are 11/1. They’re 45 times more likely than Frank’s old club to go down. Get your head round that for a second.",

      "All seemed to be going swimmingly enough in the early stages, with Arsenal winning eight of their first nine games to extend that unbeaten run to 49 league games across three seasons, but the defeat when it came threw them all off-kilter.",
      "It was an absurd and controversial defeat, at Old Trafford of all places, and it left a mark. Arsenal won only one of their next five games, and that a 5-4 absurdity in the North London Derby.",
      "They recovered their composure from there on but the aura of invincibility was lost as they trailed in 12 points behind Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea. Looking back now, you can almost see the Premier League’s tectonic plates shifting; Arsenal haven’t won the league since.",

Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",

Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",

Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",

The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever.

Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",

      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",

      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Some are excelling in jobs they were lucky to get, others stinking the place out in jobs they are lucky to retain, and they amount to half the current Premier ...",
      "Arbeloa isn’t long for Real Madrid. Here are 12 players, managers, ex-players and ‘spies’ pushing for him to be sacked.",
      "It’s Eddie Howe vs Thomas Frank in El Sackico and Sean Dyche is also on the brink, and will Kobbie Mainoo’s first ‘bad game’ come for Man Utd vs West ...",
      "Eddie Howe’s Newcastle are bang average at home, rotten on the road, can’t hold a lead, and don’t know how to turn possession into goals…",
      "The intensity and interchanging of Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno and Amad has opened new doors and new ideas for Man Utd. They are brilliant.",

      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and could make another change.",
      "The pressure has eased on West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and apparently just managing the occasional draw is enough to keep Spurs in utter purgatory with the mood-hoover Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – thiship bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there, despite an absurd and very Spurs draw against Man City and yet still, as they sleepwalk towards the Championship on the back of winning two of their last 16 Premier League games, there is no real talk of his demise.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 13 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League with an eight-point lead over an unconvincing Liverpool in sixth, and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. It’s all still an astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "Completing the double over a Newcastle side that also chucked them all the money for Wissa is magnificent. That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, 10 points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, even more so.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 14 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory at Wolves.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league. Smashing Nottingham Forest in a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer was huge and they are clearly more upwardly mobile right now than other teams around them in the table.",
      "Almost certainly not going down, and that is almost certainly enough for Farke.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… okay? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Have lost all their games since then, though. But they should still beat Derby’s infamous 11-point record – they have eight points with a guarantee of at least three more to come because they still have a game against Spurs in their locker – and after that Edwards’ primary role has always been about what happens next season rather than this.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, 2026 has seen another huge swing in Nuno’s fortunes. For neither the first nor last time, Tottenham came to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "Nuno and West Ham essentially relegated Burnley with a win at Turf Moor and suddenly, it’s not all so negative at the London Stadium where the delicious prospect grows of not only securing survival for themselves but relegating Tottenham in the process.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 12 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool. The home defeat to Brentford confirms Newcastle’s slump back into mid-table and has Howe under some notable pressure ahead of what looks like a timely appointment with Dr Tottenham in a fascinating clash between Spurs’ abysmal home form and Newcastle’s abysmal away form.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",
      "An impressive win over Newcastle eased the pressure, but that ludicrous conclusion to the Man City game puts Slot firmly back in the spotlight.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford gave Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy. Losing at Leeds a day before West Ham beat Burnley is not the best weekend.",
      "",
      "A big storyline this season has been teams carelessly succumbing to The Drift and slipping out the back of the big mid-table gang and into real trouble.",
      "Bournemouth have done it but turned it round. Tottenham have done it and are still in deep sh*t. Palace have done it and only begun the turnaround against newly-succumbing Brighton who are suddenly on a 12-game Premier League run where their only win was against Burnley at home.",
      "Their next four league games are against high-flying Villa, high-flying Brentford, a six-pointer against Forest, and table-toppers Arsenal. Hmm.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "It would be a kindness now for all concerned to end this misery. The astonishing thing is not that Frank is favourite, but that he is still odds-against and that, in all likelihood, someone else will actually go before a man who is currently leading Spurs to relegation.",
      "There was some promise in the early weeks of his reign, but it has been obvious for months and months now that the Dane is out of his depth in every way for this job.",
      "He’s small-timing it on the field and in his press conferences. He’s mildly diverting in those pressers, but it doesn’t seem enough for the near-unanimous cover being provided for him by the media, who are making the exact excuses for Frank, whose PPG has now dropped below that of Jacques Santini and Jaunde Ramos, that they mocked Ange Postecoglou for attempting.",
      "It was all the way back in November during the harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week that Frank first really did look f*cked and it’s only been the occasional Champions League night since then when things have appeared unf*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at that time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s very familiar now; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that extended the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "And yet… no. There is still no serious talk of Frank being sacked despite two wins in 16 Premier League games and the increasing if still inexplicably ignored reality of a relegation scrap for which they appear ill-equipped.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley was good enough is damning. That got him another week, so it seems only fair that another draw against Man City gets him the rest of the season. Losing against an in-form Manchester United is also probably fine because Cristian Romero.",

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",

      "Pulisic has scored 10 goals this season and featured prominently in Milan’s Champions League campaign, with his form in Serie A restoring his standing after a mixed spell earlier in his career.",
      "His potential availability is less a reflection of output and more tied to Milan’s wider planning. Milan are understood to be open to moving on valuable assets if it allows them to refresh the squad and rebalance their structure.",
      "Interest is building from England, with Arsenal, Tottenham, and Manchester United all monitoring the situation as Milan weigh their options.",
      "Arsenal would need to decide whether he fits as a rotation option or a genuine challenger in wide areas.",
      "Tottenham are evidently the shortest on quality in attacking areas, while Man United’s interest may be complicated by recent recruitment in attacking roles.",
      "United spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, with a view to raising the level of the starting XI. Any new arrival this coming summer would face stiff competition.",
      "On the other hand, a recent shift to a 4-2-3-1 under Michael Carrick could facilitate Pulisic playing on the right of an attacking three featuring Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Arsenal look well subscribed in wide areas, with Eberechi Eze, Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, and Noni Madueke all capable of featuring on the wings.",
      "Their North London neighbours, Tottenham, however, look light. Destiny Udogie and Archie Gray operated as wing-backs in a 2-0 defeat to Man Utd at the weekend.",
      "If Thomas Frank survives the season and Spurs remain in the Premier League, they’ll surely want to add to an attacking core that doesn’t feature an out-and-out wide player.",

      "One of my favourite betting angles this season is centre-forwards committing fouls on centre-backs.",
      "This season's Premier League is a bruising product to watch. The data and the eye test are telling the same story in that the league has tilted back towards directness with far more emphasis on winning first contact. And when that happens, centre-forwards don't just score goals, they start giving away fouls.",
      "The result? Centre-backs are being fouled more often than the market expects.",
      "Joao Pedro has come to life under Liam Rosenior, putting in some electric performances as the central striker where he's also been making a healthy number of fouls. In six starts as the centre-forward under the new boss. he's made eight fouls. Joe Rodon is in the firing line then when it comes to fouls drawn where he is a bulky 4/1 with Sky Bet to be fouled +2 times.",
      "Everton midfielder James Garner looks a strong play to hit +2 fouls in this one at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Garner has hit this mark in 10 of his 20 starts in central midfield this season, showing he's no stranger to getting his foot in at key moments.",
      "Bournemouth's Alex Scott, meanwhile, has been a magnet for fouls, drawing 14 in his last eight appearances. The battle between Garner and Scott in the middle of the park should see the Everton man commit a couple of challenges as he tries to disrupt Scott's rhythm.",
      "Just two wins in 16 Premier League games has left Tottenham a mere six points from safety and suddenly flirting with the drop.",
      "Sky Bet aren't messing about either. Spurs are now just 10/1 to go down.",
      "If they don't find form fast and West Ham keep winning, that relegation scrap could get very real indeed. This is getting serious.",
      "Spurs are easily swerved here at 19/10 with Sky Bet too having won just one of their last 11 Premier League home matches.",
      "Meanwhile, when the chips are down Eddie Howe usually delivers a result for Newcastle and he'll be using the frustration within the home fanbase as a weapon in the hope the north London faithful turn on their team. That's why a fast start is expected which makes the half-time/full-time market for Newcastle/Newcastle at 5/2 with Sky Bet a smart way to boost the odds on an away win.",
      "One of the standout bets on the midweek card is Crysensio Summerville to have a shot on target at Evens with Sky Bet. The winger has been a thorn in Premier League defences lately, registering nine shots on target in his last six matches.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo's tactical system is clearly suiting Summerville, giving him the freedom to drift into dangerous positions and create big moments. Against a Manchester United side that has shown vulnerability out wide, expect Summerville to be buzzing for another attempt on goal.",
      "Brighton's wobbles are a great betting edge to exploit. Just one win in 12 games isn't a blip, that's a crisis - yet the markets still have them priced as a dangerous outfit. Villa, notoriously ruthless and efficient at home, are on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet for maximum points. That looks generous based on what Brighton are serving up.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's side are struggling for creativity and confidence. The end could be near for him as Brighton boss.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen played like a man with a big point to prove on his debut. It wasn't always pretty or easy on the eye but he made his presence felt in that 1-0 win Brighton. Three fouls and a yellow card in his first appearance shows a striker visibly eager to impose himself and to make a statement.",
      "Strand Larsen averages around 1.9 fouls per game in the Premier League. That's potentially almost two yellow-card-worthy moments every 90 minutes. He carries the aura of a striker playing like it's only a matter of time before he oversteps, mistimes a challenge or lashes out in frustration. Like he did at Brighton when stopping an attack with a cynical pull of the shirt.",
      "Strand Larsen is a striker - sure - but a striker who's touchy, combative and clearly wants to make a mark. The odds are gigantic at 19/2 with Sky Bet for a card.",
      "This version of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City always gives you a chance. It's a far cry from their controlled and possession-obsessed style.",
      "Fulham, meanwhile, aren't here to make up the numbers. Both teams to score have landed in 12 of their last 15 games and they've managed that feat on their last four visits to the Etihad. That's not luck, that's a proven blueprint of being able to hit City on the counter, capitalise on mistakes and play with freedom.",
      "City will score - of course they will - but Fulham are likely to join the party. Both teams to score looks a bet at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White and Wolves. Make no mistake, there's bad blood there.",
      "Every touch will be scrutinised, every run will be jeered and if he gets on the scoresheet, the emotions are going to explode.",
      "Gibbs-White isn't shy either. He's combative, fiery and at 10/1 with Sky Bet to score and pick up a card, the value is screaming. Picture the scene: a Gibbs-White goal sparks celebrations in what has become a very big game now for Forest. The shirt may come off which triggers a booking.",
      "Combine the two through the Sky Bet BuildABet function and 10/1 looks like a steal.",
      "If you want a betting market that rewards understanding football match-ups rather than predicting perfection, the \"to be fouled\" market is as good as it gets.",
      "Bookmakers price fouls largely off averages and historical data. What they struggle to fully account for is role within a specific match-up. Like a foul-heavy centre-forward playing up against a wily centre-back. That's what we have here.",
      "This isn't about Virgil van Dijk losing control or his cool. That rarely happens.",
      "It's about Van Dijk being dragged into a very specific type of duel against his opponent in Brian Bobbey, who is not a subtle centre-forward. His game is built on confrontation.",
      "Last season at Ajax he averaged 1.8 fouls per 90, which is a huge number for a striker operating in a possession-dominant side. Even more telling is the recent trend of nine fouls across his last six games where he is bullying big-name opponents. Van Dijk is 10/11 with Sky Bet to win +1 fouls.",
      "Arsenal are scoring goals at a relentless rate, conceding here and there and making life very, very hard for anyone trying to keep them quiet. That is a perfect cocktail for backing the over 2.5 goals line when the odds flirt around the Even money mark. Their last 13 games are averaging 3.4 goals per 90 minutes and 10 of those matches have gone over 2.5 goals",
      "Even without Brentford contributing, Arsenal alone could easily cover this line. They've hit three or more goals in 10 of their last 13 matches. That's ruthless attacking form from a team who know exactly how to punish mistakes.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 13:57, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Chelsea have been flat-track bullies under Liam Rosenior in the Premier League. Four wins and 11 goals have put them firmly in the Champions League race, making ground on third-placed Aston Villa and moving above Liverpool. Leeds will test their improvements.",
      "Daniel Farke's side were going down until the sides met at the start of December. Leeds switched to a back three for the first time and ended a four-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory full of energy at Elland Road. They have lost just twice in their 11 league games since then, moving six points above the bottom three.",
      "Chelsea had just earned a spirited 1-1 draw with 10 men against Arsenal and were being talked up as possible title contenders before Leeds ended those hopes and marked the beginning of the end for Enzo Maresca.",
      "Rosenior's arrival has not been without its issues. His tactics were questioned in their Carabao Cup exit to Arsenal and they avoided defeats to Napoli and West Ham with dramatic second-half comebacks. They cannot afford to keep giving the opposition head starts.",
      "Cole Palmer roared back into form with a hat-trick at Wolves on Sunday, but this will be a wholly different assignment against an aggressive Leeds side that thrives under the lights, winning five and drawing one of their seven evening fixtures this season.David Richardson",
      "Everton vs Bournemouth - 7.30pm, Tuesday",
      "The move to the Hill Dickinson Stadium has not yet paid off for Everton, whose European hopes have been boosted by the fifth-best away record in the Premier League, leaving them just two points behind sixth-placed Liverpool.",
      "Everton are still adjusting to their new surroundings, with just four wins at home since leaving Goodison Park, their last coming in early December, but Bournemouth have only two victories on the road.",
      "The visitors have recently eased relegation concerns with a five-game unbeaten run. They should have earned a third consecutive victory on Saturday against Aston Villa, denied by Emi Martinez's seven saves, but new signing Rayan showed more promise on his first start since signing from Vasco da Gama for £30.3m.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian, who is seen as a long-term replacement for Antoine Semenyo, followed up his assist at Wolves the week before by ghosting past Lucas Digne on the right before firing past Martinez. Bournemouth are still providing plenty of attacking threat without Semenyo and the injured Justin Kluivert and Marcus Tavernier.",
      "Everton haven't lost in five either and their late turnaround win at Fulham added to goals in the final 15 minutes against Brighton and Leeds in their previous two games. David Moyes' side are grinding out results and now they need one on home turf to really worry Liverpool and the top seven.David Richardson",
      "Tottenham vs Newcastle - 7.30pm, Tuesday",
      "Two managers under pressure. Two stretched squads. And so much on the line when a team with a wretched home record hosts visitors with away-day issues.",
      "Thomas Frank and Eddie Howe have been forced to field questions about their managerial futures amid worrying runs of results and performances from their teams and this is a game they dare not lose.",
      "Howe can at least lean on a favourable record against Frank - he's won six of their nine meetings. His points-per-game record against the Dane is Howe's best against any manager he's faced at least five times.",
      "But with just two wins out of their last 15 on the road in the Premier League, Newcastle will be just as nervy as the home side going into this one.",
      "Spurs supporters were right behind their side at Old Trafford on Saturday, despite the handicap of Cristian Romero's early red card. But, without their captain on Tuesday, it would not be a surprise to feel the atmosphere sour if Newcastle do make a positive start in the game. Tottenham fans have seen their team win just four of their last 26 at home in the league.",
      "Being sucked into a relegation battle is not out of the question for the Londoners, while European qualification is looking increasingly tricky for Newcastle. For both, a win would be precious. For both, a defeat would be devastating.Peter Smith",
      "West Ham vs Manchester United - 8.15pm, Tuesday",
      "It's two years since Manchester United last beat West Ham. Crysencio Summerville is on a five-game scoring streak. And Nuno Espirito Santo has revived the Hammers' survival hopes with three wins in four Premier League games.",
      "But the momentum Manchester United will bring to east London on Tuesday night under Michael Carrick's management would be daunting for any opponent right now.",
      "Last time in the capital, they pulled off a thrilling win at Premier League leaders Arsenal, and with four wins on the spin, former Hammers midfielder Carrick is marshalling a team filled with confidence.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been at the heart of Carrick's fast start, scoring against Spurs to reach 200 goal involvements for the club - and with 10 in his last eight Premier League away games Nuno will need a gameplan to limit him.",
      "But after beating one of his old sides on Saturday, the expectation is that Carrick will do the same to West Ham this midweek, regardless of the Hammers' recent resurgence.Peter Smith",
      "Aston Villa vs Brighton - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Home losses to Everton and Brentford have curtailed momentum and there really will be panic on the Holte End if they succumb to defeat against Brighton. Manchester United and Chelsea are catching Villa. Liverpool are not far behind.",
      "The fear is that it is not only the teams below them who are catching up with Villa but the schedule too. Emery's side could yet play 60 games this season compared to United's 40 - and are without Youri Tielemans, John McGinn and Boubacar Kamara.",
      "None of that midfield trio are expected back until April and that presents a challenge for Emery to find solutions within the squad. With Leeds at home next up in the Premier League followed by Wolves away, any slip would be a major blow to their top-five hopes.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler's concerns are even more immediate given the chants of, 'you don't know what you're doing' and 'you're getting sacked in the morning' during Brighton's home defeat to rivals Crystal Palace on Sunday. A result at Villa might be required.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace vs Burnley - 7.30pm, Wednesday",
      "Some may argue that the pressure has been on all season for Scott Parker and Burnley - it's always a tough ask for promoted teams to be competitive in their first season back in the Premier League.",
      "But for a club that has often stuck with managers in difficult moments, the board's ears might begin to prickle after boos on Saturday as the Clarets lost 2-0 to relegation rivals West Ham - that is despite having 18 shots, their most in a Premier League game this season.",
      "It leaves them 11 points from safety and with no win in 16 league outings since beat bottom side Wolves on October 26. Until recently, they might have earmarked a trip to Crystal Palace as one where points could be gained.",
      "The Eagles were rarely out of the headlines in January amid a tumultuous period, but picking up their first Premier League win in nine games against rivals Brighton will give them a boost.",
      "It has taken the sting out of the tail at Selhurst Park when one wondered if a superb period of success was spectacularly unravelling before our eyes.",
      "That seems to have been halted for the time being and at home against teams near or below them, Crystal Palace have a good record.",

      "City might need something special to topple Arsenal but the prospect is yet to be rendered inconceivable. The statement at Anfield will have done as much to convince the City players themselves as it has to remind those of us who merely pass comment that the race is still open.",
      "Gary Neville believes Pep Guardiola, Erling Haaland and Gianluigi Donnarumma to be central to this rival plan. But that's too simplistic and overlooks the importance of Bernardo Silva, Rodri, as well as the returning Ruben Dias - the spine of strength. They all know how to win titles.",
      "Coupled with that is the immediate impact of January additions Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo; compelling reinforcements at this stage of the season. They both bring fresh ambition.",
      "Moving to within three points of the Gunners with victory over Fulham would ensure the scoreboard pressure mounts and Arsenal have proven to be unreliable leaders when chasers make their move to overtake in the past. City may have to leave it late again against Fulham, who have lost eight games this season after the 80th minute.",

      "Every day of the weekend brought a fresh blow for Nottingham Forest. Their insipid defeat to Leeds on Friday gifted three points to a relegation rival, before West Ham won well on Saturday and Crystal Palace ended their poor run with a victory on Sunday.",
      "The upshot is that Forest risk being in the bottom three before they even take to the field against bottom club Wolves on Wednesday night and with former boss Nuno Espirito Santo having improved West Ham's fortunes, the scrutiny on Sean Dyche is increasing.",
      "Four of the last five Premier League wins for Forest have come away from home where the counter-punching style can be more effective. Dyche's style of play is yet to convince the supporters and expectation could create tension by the Trent in midweek.",
      "While Wolves' own relegation has long since felt inevitable, and they threw the game away early at home to Chelsea on Saturday, they have been in games more than one might expect of a team adrift at the bottom and that can unnerve fragile opponents.",
      "Forest's FA Cup exit means there's an 11-day break before their next fixture against Liverpool and the mood during that period will be shaped by the outcome of this game. Failing to beat Wolves would be unthinkable, and yet many fans are already dreading it.Adam Bate",
      "Sunderland vs Liverpool - 8.15pm, Wednesday",
      "Sunderland are unbeaten in all 12 of their Premier League games played at the Stadium of Light this season, a record that puts them fourth in the home form table, and is the longest run by a promoted side since 1977-78. No team wants to travel to that outpost in north-east England, least of all Liverpool, having only managed to win two of their last 10 on the road.",
      "This fixture has got the potential to make things infinitely harder for Arne Slot after a troubling weekend. Things could go from bad to worse with no right-back to speak of (after stand-in Dominik Szoboszlai was sent off in defeat to Manchester City) and a crisis of confidence that just won't shake. Liverpool have conceded 21 goals away from Anfield this term - more than bottom side Wolves (20).",
      "But the desperation to keep up with their rivals in the top-four race might just be enough for Liverpool to rediscover some spark. Slot's side still boast some of the best attacking numbers in the league, and the Reds boss will be equally aware of the position they will find themselves in if they don't win. The gap to the European spots is already four. It can ill-afford to get any larger.Laura Hunter",
      "Brentford vs Arsenal - 8pm, Thursday",
      "Arsenal seem to be running away with the Premier League title, while Brentford are up to seventh after their first win away at Newcastle since 1934. The Gunners are top of the form table over the last 10 matches (W7 D2 L1) and the Bees are just behind (W6 D2 L2).",
      "Brentford's home form remains - as it has done for several years - among the best in the division, but Arsenal's away form is the best, bar none. If those stats aren't enough to whet the appetite, this is a battle between two set-piece specialists.",
      "Brentford - led by their former set-piece coach Keith Andrews - piqued interest with their success from long throws, so much so that, in October, Erling Haaland said playing them \"reminded me a bit of Stoke City with [Rory] Delap\". Michael Kayode and Mathias Jensen are the men tasked with delivering the monstrous deliveries that have been the source of three goals so far - the joint-second most in the division.",
      "In all, they have scored 11 goals from set-pieces and conceded nine, making them one of only eight teams yet to enter double figures in that regard.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side, on the other hand, are in a league of their own. Twenty of their 49 league goals have come from set-pieces (40.8 per cent), with 14 of those scored from corners. Both totals are unmatched in the Premier League this season. They have also only conceded five of 17 so far in that manner, which is also the least in the Premier League.",
      "If this game is to be decided by fine margins, few fixtures are better equipped to deliver.Dan Long",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 07:22, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Gary Neville on Man Utd potentially appointing Michael Carrick: \"What United have said is they're not going to be bounced into, irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months, making an appointment. They're going to wait until the end of the season\"",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",

      "Man Utd have won four Premier League games on the bounce for the first time since 2024; Michael Carrick has overseen wins against Tottenham, Fulham, Arsenal and Manchester City; he believes the team are now playing with \"expression and excitement\"",
      "Sunday 8 February 2026 07:02, UK",
      "It's four Premier League wins in a row for Manchester United under Michael Carrick and a season that was unraveling just weeks ago now looks full of potential and promise.",
      "A 2-0 victory over Tottenham at Old Trafford extended Carrick's 100 per cent start as head coach and will further strengthen his case to be given the job on a long-term basis. At the very least, his impressive impact surely puts him in the conversation.",
      "Saturday's win also marks the first time in two years that United have won four Premier League games on the spin, with hopes of a top-four finish and a return to the lucrative Champions League now looking more realistic than not.",
      "Carrick was particularly pleased with the purpose of his side, encouraging \"expression and excitement\", as Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes scored the goals that extended their unbeaten streak to eight games overall - their longest run since 2022.",
      "\"The first goal is normally vital, to get ahead, but I think it's just encouraging the expression, the attacking play,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Not so much enjoyment where you can do what you want and it's a playground, kind of flicks and tricks, but more playing with a purpose and confidence.",
      "\"The connection with everyone has been as good as anything. The feeling, the emotion and connection with players, staff and fans - it feels good. We've had to win games in different ways. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the stadium this way, to look forward to the excitement.",
      "\"I'm pleased with the buy-in. We're in a good emotional place and that helps you. The four games we've had look different, we've not cracked it. I'm aware of that.",
      "\"We're just moving on to the next one and not settling for what we've got. Not taking things for granted is something we speak about a lot and the boys have been really good for that so far.\"",
      "Carrick has transformed United's fortunes since he was parachuted in to replace Ruben Amorim last month. As well as beating Spurs and Fulham, he has also masterminded wins over the division's top two sides Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "Captain Fernandes believes Carrick has added 'something special.' He said: \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch.",
      "\"It's very good. I was sure he would be a great manager and he is showing it. We hope we can help him even more.",
      "\"Everyone understands the pressure of playing for this club, everyone knows the expectations around it. He knows what it means for this club to win. It adds something special to the team.\"",
      "Fernandes himself has been at the heart of United's revival. Asked if the midfielder is among the most in-form players in the Premier League currently, Carrick added: \"Listen, it'd take a long time to sum it up [his contribution here].",
      "\"I think he's offered the club so much in the time he's been here, since he walked in the door. He played different roles today for us and ended up on the left. The second goal was from the left as we changed things around a little bit.",
      "\"He's a team player, he gives so much to the group. He's got big moments in him but we know the quality he has. He cares a lot for this football club and the team and that is clear to see.\"",
      "There was plenty of hyperbolic conversation in the press room at Old Trafford on Saturday. The question most were asking: 'Are Manchester United back?'",
      "Not to rain on the parade, but it's perhaps a little too early to declare United as fully reformed. They do, however, look imposing in Carrick's mould, fluid in attack and organised defensively.",
      "He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. Tangibly it hasn't. But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times given what came before.",
      "Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since. What I like most is the coordination in each attacking phase; so well balanced.",
      "Carrick is also showing impressive maturity and composure in-game. His decision-making is drawing praise. This looks to be the start of something with huge promise - and maybe even longevity.",

      "Manchester United have won four Premier League games in a row for the first time since February 2024 under Erik ten Hag. It's taken two years, but it seems like Michael Carrick has cracked it. He was true to form post-match, calm and controlled in his exchanges with reporters, emphasising that nothing has been achieved yet. He's right, tangibly it hasn't.",
      "But for these long-suffering United fans, the gift of four on the bounce will feel like a lottery win. These are heady times, given what came before. Carrick's United have already eclipsed last season's points total with over a third of the season remaining. It's impossible to overstate the underperformance in the 18 months preceding his appointment, but equally important to highlight the impact since.",
      "Casemiro is in his best form as a United player. Luke Shaw is also rolling back the years. Diogo Dalot looks transformed. And the decision to leave Kobbie Mainoo out in the cold for so long by the previous regime is looking sillier by the week. Combined, the team have scored 10 goals in four under Carrick, and conceded just four. The improvement across the board is as obvious on the eye as it is measured by results.",
      "Man Utd's decision makers have plenty to ponder if this upturn is here to stay.Laura Hunter",
      "Cristian Romero as captain is a problem for Thomas Frank, despite him not wanting to admit it. Continually, Romero has proved himself to be unreliable and reckless. And now he's surely also beginning to lose some of the respect of his team-mates, sent off for the second time this season at the cost of a four-game suspension. He's the first player to be sent off twice in the Premier League this season.",
      "Some might argue he should not have even started the game at Old Trafford given his midweek rant about the Tottenham squad's \"disgraceful depth\", but Frank backed him. He badly let his manager down. Now he's lost the moral high ground too.",
      "There is something awfully ironic about a player so troubled by Tottenham's lack of options that he took to social media to spell out his gripe publicly, who himself is now unavailable to feature for his team until mid-March. Romero has one red card for every 25 games he has played for the club. Those in glass houses should not throw stones - the defender would be wise to remember that.Laura Hunter",
      "Gabriel Jesus' return from injury has meant one key thing from the perspective of Viktor Gyokeres. He is no longer guaranteed to lead the line for Arsenal.",
      "Given it has been a tough season for the Swede, it may have been easy for him to go into his shell even more. He has been used to averaging a goal a game or better in the last couple of seasons. With 11 goals in 31 appearances for the Gunners, he is well off those levels.",
      "But a noticeable improvement is apparent. The 27-year-old has eight goal involvements in his last eight games. In 2026, he has more goals than any other Premier League player across all competitions.",
      "Yes, some might point to the opposition in some of these. Kairat Almaty should've been brushed aside. Leeds and Sunderland are not easy games, but still ones you'd expect Arsenal to win. But amongst that are also goals and assists against Chelsea and Inter Milan too.",
      "Notably, the goal against Inter was similar to his second against the Black Cats. Gyokeres was able to bear down on goal with the opposition pressing. The finishes were different, but the nature was the same. And he was fresher having come off the bench.",
      "Perhaps that's the key for unlocking the best from Gyokeres towards the back end of the season. With Jesus and Havertz back as options, does Arteta look at Gyokeres as more of an impact player on the bench.",
      "That role would appear to suit his strengths some more. Very rarely do Arsenal play in a way that allows Gyokeres the chance to run in behind and get a march on defenders, since they are usually holding possession in areas high up the pitch.",
      "But, in tight games like against Inter or Sunderland, their resolute defensive structure means they can soak up pressure and then hit teams on the break. With Gyokeres fresh and up top in those moments, there's no player in that Gunners squad they'd rather have leading the charge.",
      "The strength in depth Arteta has at his disposal is going to be crucial from now until the end of the season. Nine goals from the bench is the highest of any Premier League club and proves just how much quality he has. But just as important as that. is how he utilises it.",
      "Would Gyokeres have been dreaming of coming to the Emirates to be a player to come off the bench? Of course not. However, that may be where he is most effective from now up until the season's end.Callum Bishop",
      "Defying expected goals has been a common theme for Aston Villa this season but it looks like their luck is beginning to run out.",
      "Morgan Rogers' well-taken goal was against the run of play and the promise they showed in the early stages of this game quickly faded.",
      "A tally of just 0.44 xG highlights the lack of cutting edge, intent and quality in the final third which plagued this performance.",
      "If it wasn't for Emiliano Martinez and the seven saves he made, Villa would have walked away empty-handed.",
      "A nine-point gap to Arsenal at the top of the table has quickly opened and dreams of competing for the title have shifted to fears over the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United closing in behind them.",
      "They still hold an eight-point gap on Liverpool in sixth but if they continue to play like this, that will reduce and their hopes of securing Champions League football will follow suit.",
      "In both the defeat to Brentford and the draw to Bournemouth, Villa have been dull and uninspiring. Injuries have plagued the squad, but there is no time for excuses; Villa need to find their spark again.Patrick Rowe",
      "One goal, one assist - Rayan's already lighting up the Premier League after just two appearances.",
      "The 19-year-old Brazilian is seen as Antoine Semenyo's long-term replacement after signing for Bournemouth in a £30.3m deal from Vasco da Gama during the January transfer window.",
      "The winger came on to provide an assist in the 2-0 victory at Wolves last weekend and was then handed his first start against Aston Villa, hitting the crossbar with a header in the first half before netting the equaliser in the second.",
      "Rayan's size instantly makes him stand out. He is not as lightweight as his compatriot Estevao at Chelsea and is more of a direct runner like Semenyo. That's how he scored what should be the first of many for Bournemouth, driving past Lucas Digne into the area before finishing.",
      "He will have little issue in adapting to the physicality of the Premier League, winning eight of his 13 duels against Villa and under Andoni Iraola, he can be moulded into the club's next hot property.David Richardson",
      "West Ham love a talisman. A maverick-type individual who doesn't necessarily bend or sway in the same direction of the team but will always deliver.",
      "From Carlos Tevez to Dimitri Payet, an individual who captures the hearts and minds of Hammers is West Ham heritage.",
      "Crysencio Summerville could be another talisman on a long line of individual stars at West Ham as he continues drive West Ham's survival bid.",
      "His fifth straight goal in as many matches at Burnley was a crucial one. For many obvious reasons, as it set the tone for the Hammers' eventual victory.",
      "However, on a personal note, it marks the \"coming of a Hammer\" for Summerville, who hadn't scored all season before his current run.",
      "While his talent has never been questioned since making the move from Leeds in 2024, his consistency due to injury has hindered his overall impact.",
      "There's no time like the present for Summerville to continue to leave his mark, with West Ham in need of someone to guide them into Premier League safety.William Bitibiri",
      "In a season marred by injury and frustration, doubts about Cole Palmer were just starting to creep into mainstream football conversation.",
      "Before Saturday's win at Wolves, Palmer had just four goals this season, with only two Premier League goals from open play since January 2025, and looked a player bereft of confidence in a disappointing substitute appearance against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup in midweek.",
      "How about a hat-trick to silence the doubters?",
      "With this triple, Palmer became the first player in Premier League history to score three hat-tricks in the first half of a match, while his four hat-tricks overall are the most of any Chelsea player in Premier League history.",
      "But it was the manner of his three goals which will mean so much to the Chelsea star. He took his two penalties with his quintessential coolness - and smashing in his hat-trick goal from open play three minutes after his second displayed the confident Palmer Chelsea fans had grown so used to seeing in the last two seasons.",
      "\"In terms of Cole, we know what a world-class player he is,\" said new Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior, who lauded his hat-trick hero throughout his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He's played a lot of football for the last year, not much rest, but when he's at his best, he's unstoppable.\"",
      "With eight wins in their last 10 games, Chelsea are a team on the up - and a fully-fit, confident Palmer will only increase opponents' fears of an already formidable side.Noah Langford",
      "Rob Edwards had seen his side go a whole month without scoring a Premier League goal so perhaps the Wolves boss could be forgiven going with such an attacking line-up for the visit of Chelsea. It was a 4-2-3-1 with Angel Gomes as a deep-lying playmaker.",
      "\"We wanted to be really positive, we wanted to be brave, press higher, and then we wanted to try and have more of an attacking threat on the pitch. Removing a defender and putting a more attacking player on it, simply speaking that was the thinking.\"",
      "He abandoned the plan when 3-0 down inside the first half. The penalties conceded by Matt Doherty and Yerson Mosquera were labelled \"ludicrous mistakes\" by Edwards. His side threatened to capitulate in the minutes that followed before going to a back five.",
      "The issues were as much mental as tactical but it was a chastening reminder for Edwards of the fragility - just one of the reasons why Wolves are rooted to the bottom of the table. Dealing with these battle scars is just part of the challenge he faces now.Adam Bate",
      "The boos that rang around St James' Park were angry and pointed. Newcastle fans expect better than this.",
      "Eddie Howe was keen to accept that - but also provide mitigating circumstances. Five injured players are out in Joelinton, Fabian Schar, Tino Livarmento, Lewis Miley and Anthony Gordon. There is also a hectic fixture list which is not holding up, while simple mistakes are being punished.",
      "The excuses have been there all season for Newcastle. A lack of attacking fluency could go date back to Alexander Isak's transfer saga - that set the club back in their pre-season preparations. Newcastle now don't know who their No 9 is out of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, perhaps Isak's transfer drama is finally catching up with them.",
      "But there are also circumstances that Howe can control. Newcastle have conceded 15 goals in their last five games - even though defence is an area the club actually strengthened in last summer.",
      "Everything that made Howe's Newcastle hard to beat is drifting away. And that tough fixture list, it's hotting up. Up next are four testing away games in Spurs, Aston Villa, Qarabag and Man City. If Howe can't find a solution to this slump, this could get ugly.Sam Blitz",
      "Everton manager David Moyes was not sure whether to talk up his side's European prospects or play them down after their late come-from-behind win at Fulham, and instead ended up doing both!",
      "\"Hugely important [win] and I think it probably keeps us away from the big R word at the bottom of the league, that's for sure,\" he initially said after the game without a hint of sarcasm, before revealing his true feelings.",
      "\"I don't want to come in here and say we're trying to avoid relegation. I don't want to do that because Everton have had too much bad news and bad publicity, so I'd rather come in here and say we're having a go at Europe.",
      "\"You might laugh at me in a few weeks' time and say, 'How stupid was I', but I'd rather be positive.\"",
      "However, with the Toffees now in a tightly congested pack hot on the tails of sixth-placed Liverpool, Moyes and his players really can dare to dream of a first European appearance for nine seasons and why not, given their impressive form since the Scot returned to manage the club last January.",
      "In fact, Everton rank sixth for points won in that time, so do not be shocked if that is where they finish come May.Richard Morgan",
      "Elland Road. Under the lights. It's a formidable challenge for any Premier League side and the home advantage Leeds garner in these matches was plain to see on a wet, windy and wildly successful night for Daniel Farke's side. They've won all five of their evening kick-offs here this season now.",
      "The playing surface wasn't ideal for either side - Farke suggested it was more suitable for sheep than footballers - but Leeds' high-intensity play, fuelled by the energy of their supporters, left Forest stuck in the mud.",
      "Across the pitch, Leeds players were excellent, from Karl Darlow's saves and James Justin's chance creation to Iliev Gruev's box-to-box excellence and the goal-scoring of Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.",
      "Their nine-point advantage on the drop zone was trimmed to six by Saturday's win for West Ham but that made this impressive thumping of Forest all the more important. A tricky run of fixtures is coming up but with points on the board and taking the confidence from this display, Farke's side should be optimistic of winning this Premier League survival battle.Peter Smith",
