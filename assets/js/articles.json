      "Marcus Rashford's future at Manchester United remains uncertain for 2025/26 as the summer transfer window reopens. The forward fell out of favour in the Red Devils starting XI when Ruben Amorim arrived at Old Trafford in November after the dismissal of Erik ten Hag.",
      "And as a result, he was sent out on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of the season, writing on Instagram at the time: \"I would like to thank Manchester United and Aston Villa for making this loan deal happen. I was lucky to have a few clubs approach me but Aston Villa was an easy decision - I really admire the way that Aston Villa have been playing this season, and the manager's ambitions.",
      "\"I just want to play football and am excited to get started. I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best for the rest of the season.\"",
      "While Rashford impressed at Villa Park under the tutelage of Unai Emery - scoring four goals and providing six assists in 17 games - it seems unlikely at present that the club will exercise their £40million option to buy him permanently. As a result, Rashford is set to return to Old Trafford, although it is unlikely that he will work his way back into the team under Amorim.",
      "As he is under contract until 2028, the price will ultimately have to be right for Rashford to be given permission to leave the Red Devils. With an interesting summer transfer window in full effect, here's the latest on Rashford's situation - including all of the teams that he has been linked with a move to ahead of 2025/26...",
      "While Villa hold a £40m option to buy Rashford after his loan spell, they do not hold first refusal on him should another club come and match that offer. Meanwhile, with Rashford looking to find his way back into the England squad under Thomas Tuchel, he will hope to play Champions League football in 2025/26 - something he will not be able to do with the Villains, and as a result, he may choose to give other elite clubs priority.",
      "Meanwhile at the end of the season, Rashford took to Instagram to write a heart-felt message which came across as more of a farewell than an 'I'll see you again soon.' He wrote: \"Just a message of thanks to everyone here at Villa for what has (injury aside) been an incredible few months for me.",
      "\"It is a really special club and I appreciated the way Villa fans embraced me with open arms from 1st minute on the pitch. Manager, team, and coaching staff have all been brilliant. I know it is a huge disappointment not to have made the Champions League place which everyone worked so hard all season for but I know this club and team will come back stronger.\"",
      "While it has been reported that Rashford is currently holding out hope for a move to Barcelona, the likelihood of a transfer coming to fruition seems to be getting slimmer by the day. The English international has already reportedly announced that he's willing to take a pay cut from his current £350,000-per-week deal to play for the Catalan giants, however, it appears as though Barca have had their heads turned by other players elsewhere.",
      "It is understood that Barcelona's sporting director, Deco, recently made his way to meet with Athletic Club's Nico Williams after holding talks with the left-winger's agent. It is said that the 22-year-old Spaniard is keen on joining the La Liga giants this summer, and Barca could utilise a relatively cheap £48.1m release clause to secure the star.",
      "With five goals and five assists this season, Williams has proven himself at the highest level of Spanish football - but Barcelona have been warned that they will have to sell players to get a deal over the line due to financial stipulations. La Liga president Javier Tebas recently said of the club: \"They don’t yet meet the requirements to sign freely, they can’t sign yet under the 1:1 rule. If they want Nico, they will have to sell and adjust their accounts a lot.\"",
      "Elsewhere, it is said that Barcelona are also interested in acquiring the services of Liverpool sensation Luis Diaz, who scored 13 goals and provided seven assists this season to excel in the Premier League. However, with a valuation of around £59m at present according to Transfermarkt, a deal may come as a little too rich for Deco's liking.",
      "With regards to Rashford, it is reported that Barcelona would be looking to secure a loan with an option to buy, but if United are only looking for an immediate permanent transfer, he may need to reassess his options.",
      "While Newcastle United are currently content with Alexander Isak up top, it is reported that the Magpies are willing to table an offer to save Rashford from his current tribulations in the north west, as Eddie Howe sees him as the perfect player to rotate with the £160m Swedish star.",
      "Newcastle are reportedly prepared to shell out as much as £40m to secure Rashford this summer, but it is understood that he is likely to reject any advances from the Tyneside-based team as he continues to hold out for a move to Barca. Given that Newcastle managed a fifth-place finish in the Premier League this season, the side will once again compete in the Champions League in 2025/26 - something that may help turn the head of Rashford ever so slightly.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today."

      "Manchester United's plan to win the Premier League title by 2028 has been ridiculed by former striker Teddy Sheringham – who branded it “pie in the sky”.",
      "Sheringham also claimed United boss Ruben Amorim will be sacked if he makes a poor start to the new campaign, after ending last season in 15th place – their lowest-ever Premier League finish. Despite that shambolic season, United chief executive Omar Berrada has doubled down on his belief they will lift the Premier League trophy by 2028.",
      "Berrada launched Project 150, the aim of which is for United to win a 21st league title by 2028, the year the club celebrates its 150th anniversary. But after 18 league defeats last season and the failure to secure European football for only the second time in 35 years, Sheringham accused Berrada of living in dreamland with his title claim.",
      "“Omar Berrada’s comments are dreamlike,” said Sheringham. “In football clubs, you’ve got to have small steps to get to places. If you see those small steps and are encouraged and moving in the right direction, that’s when you start looking positively at the future.",
      "“But when people come out with quotes like that, it can be pie in the sky when you’ve got to give the manager time to get things right. For United, the results must improve. It can’t go on like this. The way the talk is – 'it’s alright, we’re gearing for next year, everything is ok for next season'.",
      "“But I think they’re a long way off being anything like the United of old and the pressure will be on Amorim, without a doubt. If he starts the season like the end of last season, there's only one way things will go.”",
      "Sheringham, who scored in United's dramatic 2-1 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in 1999, to clinch the Treble, also said every player should be up for sale – apart from skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“Any player that’s underachieving at United would be surplus to requirements,” said Sheringham. \"And there’s not a lot of players at United who are playing at the top of their form, other than Fernandes.",
      "“So I would think that any offers that come in for anyone playing for United would be very welcome, to be able to get players out and to get others in. Sometimes players fall off a cliff, but I can’t see him [Fernandes] doing that, he’s still got the appetite to go out and do better and lead by example.",
      "“But if Fergie had an offer of £100million for one of his 31-year-old players, going on 32, for the business end of the football club, you’d have to think about things like that.”",
      "Sheringham also said he has sympathy for United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who managed just 10 goals last season, claiming the service provided by his team-mates is simply not good enough.",
      "“We’ve been speaking about Højilund for a good couple of years now,” said Sheringham. “First and foremost, I still think he’s a decent striker, I just think he’s been starved of service at United.",
      "“The way they play, they play with two out and out wingers, no real support apart from Fernandes getting forward. It’s all about the service for centre-forwards and he’s had none. I struggle to think about any striker that you could put in there, that would suffer from the same service and still score goals.",
      "\"You’d have to be some player like Didier Drogba, who did things on his own at times, to score goals. Being a young man as Høljund is and coming into a new country and into the Premier League, trying to understand it, I think he’s had a tough ride.”",

      "Everton should target a summer move for Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund according to their former player Pat Nevin. Hojlund has endured two difficult seasons since joining the Red Devils in a £72million deal from Atalanta.",
      "The 22-year-old scored 10 goals in 52 appearances last term as United struggled to find the net and 16 goals in 43 outings during his debut season in 2023/24. Ruben Amorim is looking to strengthen his forward line this summer having already added Matheus Cunha from Wolves, and the likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen linked to transfers.",
      "Nevin, who played 150 games for the Toffees and scored 21 goals, reckons David Moyes would be able to prise the Denmark international away from Old Trafford on loan. And he believes the Everton boss will find a player well-suited to his style.",
      "Moyes will find himself short a striker as Dominic Calvert-Lewin's contract runs out at the end of June. And Nevin reckons the perfect solution is out there.",
      "Speaking to Spin Genie, the ex-Scotland international has urged Moyes to make a move. \"There are some good names out there,\" said Nevin.",
      "\"The loan market is something Everton have looked at in the past and I think it's something they should revisit again. It gives them all sorts of possibilities as they're not spending £50 million.",
      "\"There are two or three players that they could think about bringing in from Manchester United but Rasmus Hojlund is the one that sticks out. If you look at his style of play, it’s a perfect match with how David Moyes likes to play. While his numbers haven't been great this season, Moyes loves hard workers and that's something you can never complain about in regards to Hojlund.",
      "\"It's not very often David Moyes has had a 20-30 goals-per-season striker. He’s had strikers who run in behind and create space to bring others into play, so, if he's available, Hojlund could be a tempting option for Everton to sign on loan.\"",
      "Everton have already missed out on Liam Delap this summer, after the striker joined Chelsea. Moyes has admitted that the Toffees will need to find greater success to enjoy an easier time in the transfer market.",
      "“Players, if they have the chance, want to play in the Champions League. I’ve just come out of a club ( West Ham United) where three out of four years we played in Europe and what a difference it makes when you’re a club in Europe because the players are attracted, whatever European competition that is, is attractive to a lot of players and makes a big difference,\" he said.",
      "“We’re not at that at the moment so I don’t know if I can compare us selling Wayne [Rooney] but we were always a club that didn’t have a huge amount of money. We had to generate some money ourselves.",
      "“But then, the club had £500million to spend and in that period and I don’t think it was as good as when we spent carefully and were a little bit wiser.\"",

      "The 2-2 draw on Monday was a tense affair as three players were dismissed in total, with Jorge Figal joining Herrera in receiving an early bath, while Andrea Belotti was sent off for Benfica.",
      "Herrera was given his marching orders just before half-time after attempting to barge his way through to speak to the referee while he was in the middle of a VAR review.",
      "The former Spain international had to be held back by security officials and referee Cesar Arturo Ramos reached for his back pocket and issued the red card after being informed of the player's conduct.",

      "However, Boca Juniors said they would appeal against the length of the bans, with Ole reporting that the club have questioned why Belotti was only given a two-match ban for a high boot on Ayrton Costa.",

      "In the end, the allure of trophies is what swayed Harry Kane to Bayern Munich in the summer of 2023. Throughout his time at Tottenham, Kane was renowned as one the continent's top strikers and was on the radar of every top European club.",
      "In 2021, Kane did everything he could to try and force a move to Manchester City, including publicly stating his desire to leave Spurs during a round of golf with Gary Neville. However, he waited two more years before Bayern forked out £100m to bring him to Bavaria from North London.",
      "While Bayern won the race, Manchester United had been working on a move for the England captain for some time. When Erik ten Hag first took up the reins at United, it was exclusively revealed by the Mirror that he wanted Kane to be one of his first transfer signings. However, it was not the right time for Kane, as he was determined to become Spurs' record goalscorer.",
      "Moreover, if the England skipper was to leave, it would have been for a club that was immediately ready to challenge for the big trophies and not one that was building or in transition.",
      "After overtaking Sir Jimmy Greaves' Spurs tally the following February, United thought they had the perfect opportunity to sign Kane. Spurs finished outside the top four, during a campaign which saw Antonio Conte be sacked by the club, while United had just won the League Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third.",
      "Kane had also publicly said that he wanted to overtake Alan Shearer's record of scoring 260 Premier League goals, seemingly ruling out a move abroad. With City enjoying Erling Haaland's services and Liverpool signing Cody Gakpo at the time, a move to United appeared to be the only realistic Premier League move.",
      "It was a more promising situation than 12 months before when Kane was reluctant to move to Old Trafford after United's struggles under Ole Gunnar-Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. The Red Devils finished sixth with their worst points tally for 32 years and had also endured their fifth consecutive campaign without a trophy.",
      "Kane's motivation to leave Tottenham was driven by his desire to win a major trophy. At the time, the North Londoners were seemingly in a better position to win a title than United.",
      "The England frontman had decided that he would only leave Tottenham for a side that's ready to compete for big trophies immediately and not one that was in transition. Kane was impressive in his final campaign at Spurs, but their 8th placed finish meant the writing was on the wall in regard to his future.",
      "Initially, it was reported that Kane's representatives had a \"secret meeting\" with Paris Saint-Germain, who were interested in a move. PSG transfer chief Luis Campos held an \"informal conversation\" over Kane's future, according to Foot Mercato.",
      "At the time, PSG were embarking on a fresh approach to transfers and were in the process of moving Lionel Messi and Neymar on, so they could build a younger and fresher team. A move to the French capital did not suffice and with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy being reluctant to sell to a Premier League rival, Bayern Munich were in the right place at the right time.",
      "When the rumours about a move to Germany were ongoing, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy urged Kane to move to Bayern and plunder as many goals and trophies as possible. In his column for Daily Mail, Murphy said: \"If Bayern Munich come calling this summer, he should go. It would be hugely sad if a player of his quality finished [his career] without winning a trophy. It's something he himself would regret after retirement.\"",
      "He added: \"Going abroad might cost him Alan Shearer's Premier League goals record but, in the grand scheme of things, that shouldn't put him off. In five years, we could be talking about Harry Kane, Champions League winner with multiple Bundesliga titles and cup medals.",
      "\"I'm sure Kane will get other offers. Manchester United have been mentioned, but he hasn't got time to be part of a team that is building. If he was going to leave, it would be primarily to win trophies from the get-go, which would make Bayern his best option.\"",
      "Kane would go on to snub any other interest from United to secure his £100m move to Bayern. After a disappointing first season saw Bayern fail to win a trophy for the first time in a decade, Kane won the Bundesliga under Vincent Kompany, helping himself to 38 goals and 13 assists in 47 matches along the way.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

Even outside of such pairings, the Premier League fixture selection is designed to avoid having clubs from the same area travelling on the same train lines across the Football League and the Premier League to avoid 'pinch points' on rail and road networks.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come under fire from supporters for his decision-making at Old Trafford following a series of cost-cutting measures that has seen him slash concessions and raise prices, on top of scrapping free lunches for staff. He has also axed Sir Alex Ferguson from his ambassadorial role amid the club's perilous financial position.",

      "\"This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans,\" the statement read. \"When the Club said they were introducing this new model for Members tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",

      "Despite several blunders last season against the likes of Lyon, Leicester and Brighton, he remained the club's first-choice keeper. However, his position is one that Amorim may look to strengthen this summer.",

Just as significantly, Chelsea do not have to leave London until over a month into the campaign, a home starter against Crystal Palace being followed by a trip to West Ham before a derby with Fulham at Stamford Bridge is followed by a short hop to Brentford.",

      "Senior men Christian Eriksen , Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are to be joined by Hubert Graczyk , Jack Kingdon , Sam Murray , Tom Myles , James Nolan and Tom Wooster in being released at the end of their contracts on June 30.",
      "The entire squad is available for the right price but there are several who clearly have no roles to play under Amorim.",
      "Rashford shone in parts while on loan at Aston Villa and has been linked with a switch to Barcelona but only a select few clubs can afford his £1m a month salary. Similar is true of Antony, who did well at Real Betis. Except the La Liga club cannot afford the Brazilian’s wages either.",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, was supposedly told to find a new club after a row because he was left on the bench for much of the nightmare Europa League defeat to Tottenham last month. Veteran midfielder Casemiro is welcome to find a new club, so too flop striker Rasmus Hojlund because he is yet to adapt after two full seasons up front.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Manchester United supporters have slammed the ‘fresh kick in the teeth’ as ticket prices continue to rise under Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The Red Devils unveiled a controversial new pricing strategy ahead of the 2025/26 Premier League campaign.",
      "Season tickets have increased by around five percent, while a new approach for non-season ticket supporters has been implemented. United have categorised their fixtures for next season, with some more expensive than others.",
      "And that new approach has not gone down well with fans. A statement from the Manchester United Supporters’ Trust read: \"This really is a fresh kick in the teeth for Manchester United fans. When the Club said they were introducing this new model for Members tickets, we urged them to keep the majority of matches at current levels and only apply the highest price category for a small number of the biggest games, and reduced prices for lower demand games.",
      "“Once again, they have failed to consult any of the fans representative bodies on the details of the decision, and once again they’re making choices against the interests of fans and, we believe, the Club as a whole.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the club’s Fans’ Advisory board has also spoken out on the change in ticketing prices and strategy. A statement read: “We, the Manchester United Fans’ Advisory Board, strongly advocated for an across-the-board price freeze for 2025/26 season, one we felt was justified due to the current circumstances.",
      "“While we did not get the freeze we argued for, we are relieved that the club was persuaded to limit the increases to the same percentage rise as recent seasons, and we are pleased they froze prices for our youngest fans.",
      "“We also shared our concerns over policy changes and advised against any immediate changes without consultation including those to minimum usage, match categorisation, concessions and relocations. However, we welcome the club's renewed commitment not to make any such future changes without consultation with fans including through MUST, FAB and the Fans' Forum.",
      "“We acknowledge that the senior leadership of the club, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Omar Berrada, made themselves available throughout the process and the club were well informed of fans’ feelings when making their decisions.”",
      "Omar Berrada also said: “While they did not agree with all the decisions, we would like to thank the members of our FAB for their tough but constructive advice throughout the consultation process. We believe that, taken together, these measures represent a fair and balanced outcome for fans, while generating additional revenues to strengthen the club.”",
      "The changes have been too much for legendary former United star Norman Whiteside, who has given up his season ticket a year after the relocation of his seat.",

      "Gyokeres has fired his way to becoming one of European football's elite marksmen, bagging 97 goals in just 102 games for Portuguese outfit Sporting CP, whom he has helped to a pair of league titles.",
      "When head coach Ruben Amorim departed Sporting to take up the reins at Old Trafford in November, the prospect of Gyokeres following suit was mooted, given the Red Devils' faltering forward line. Although United have persued the 27-year-old with robustness this summer, reports earlier this month detailed that Gyokeres had turned his nose up at a Manchester reunion.",
      "Now, Portuguese outlet A Bola say that Gyokeres has become frustrated with a lack of transfer movement, but has set out which clubs he would like to join this window. They are Mikel Arteta's Gunners and Juventus, who have supposedly tabled a mammoth £11-million-a-year wage offer.",
      "According to the report, five clubs have expressed an interest in signing Gyokeres, with the Swedish striker currently enjoying a well-earned holiday.",
      "In England, both United and Arsenal have long been documented to hold the goalscorer in high regard, and Atletico Madrid, Juve and Saudi Pro League side Al Ahli are among the other noted suitors.",
      "However, Gyokeres has supposedly prioritised moving to either the Emirates or Turin, and to rub further salt into the Red Devils' wounds, it is claimed he would also welcome any approach made by rivals City and Liverpool.",
      "It is said that the £70million-rated Swedish star would also prefer moves to the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG or Bayern Munich, and he remains 'upset' that he has not yet been allowed to make a switch.",
      "While Gyokeres has seemingly made it crystal clear that a move to north London would be his ideal Premier League transfer, the Gunners also have their eye on another striker.",
      "Reports from German outlet BILD suggest that RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko is close to joining Arsenal this window, and personal terms have been agreed between both parties. With the Bundesliga club failing to qualify for European football this term, a fee in the region of £70m-£85m could seal the deal.",
      "Gyokeres may then turn his attention to his other priority, Juventus, who Corriere dello Sport reports have offered him a lucrative £11m per year to leave for Serie A.",
      "With it seeming increasingly likely that Gyokeres will not join United, Frankfurt's Hugo Ekitike has emerged as another name who could be brought in to bolster United's firepower.",
      "As first reported by The Times, Amorim's side are interested in making a move for the Frenchman, and a £60m price tag has been slapped on the star who scored 22 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "\"I'm glad we have him [Ekitike]. If he decides otherwise, that's our motto: If a player develops faster than us, we let him go,\" admitted Frankfurt chief Markus Kroshce ahead of what promises to be an incident-packed transfer window.",

      "The Reds stormed to their first title since 2020 last season in what was boss Arne Slot's first campaign as manager after replacing Jurgen Klopp. Arsenal finished as the runners-up for the third successive year, while City's hopes of defending their crown for a fifth successive year ended in tatters.",
      "Nottingham Forest were the surprise package of the year, securing qualification to the Europa Conference League. Down at the other end of the table, relegated Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have been replaced by Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland.",
      "Anticipation for the new season will only be growing as the summer goes on, with the summer transfer window in full swing. Liverpool have been working hard to give Slot the best chance of leading a successful title defence.",
      "They have already signed Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez on their way into Anfield. And it appears that those moves may well pay off for the Reds.",
      "According to a supercomputer from BettingLounge.co.uk, Liverpool will finish top of the league for a second successive year. The supercomputer is a probability model, not determined by human predictions or bias.",
      "It instead estimates the outcome of each remaining fixture based on a team’s current strength (based on factors such as league position and form) and betting market odds. The machine then simulates the remaining games in a season 10,000 times and constructs an average league table from the 10,000 simulations, to rule out anomalous results.",
      "Slot's side have been backed to lose just four games and win 24 matches to claim the title. Their closest challengers are tipped to be City, who are predicted to finish three points behind the Reds.",

      "Having responded to a season that ended on a minus goal difference with four defensive signings last year, Manchester United are redressing the balance this summer after their goal difference became ten times worse.",
      "Matheus Cunha lived up to his number '10' with Wolves last season, tallying 15 Premier League goals. Bryan Mbeumo got five more for Brentford and United are in the market for a new No.9.",
      "Well-placed figures at United spoke about three or four signings before the end of last season. Three of those would go straight into the first team.",
      "A new frontman, Cunha, Mbeumo, Amad and Bruno Fernandes in the same starting XI is an imposing attack. Ruben Amorim will have Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and probably Joshua Zirkzee to call upon as well.",
      "Beyond the three intended attacking additions, the starting XI may otherwise be untouched. United absolutely need an athletic midfielder but they have to get Manuel Ugarte, a considerable investment at £50.75million, up to speed after a patchy first season.",
      "A new signing's maiden campaign can always be couched as one of adaptation. Ugarte was not Erik ten Hag's pick to shore up a porous midfield and United's style under the Dutchman was no different before his eventual defenestration in October.",
      "Ugarte was entrusted by Ruud van Nistelrooy, a fellow fluent Spanish speaker, during his caretaker stint and he started in 28 of his former Sporting coach Amorim's 42 matches in the dugout. Yet Ugarte ended the season behind Casemiro, regarded as a busted flush, in the pecking order and was benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's fine form was reserved solely for Europe and he could be redundant in a season comprising only domestic football. Provisionally, Amorim has to reinstall Ugarte with Fernandes as his probable partner in midfield.",
      "Ugarte and Fernandes have started in a midfield two 11 times and United were beaten on only four occasions. Two of those defeats came three days after Europa League knockout ties, a period when United were half-hearted in their weekend fixtures.",
      "Whether United are able to shift Casemiro or not, they require a major reinforcement in the middle third. Mainoo's positioning is largely irrelevant as the alternative is Toby Collyer, whose three starts for the club have come against teams from Scotland, Romania and League One.",
      "United are about to release two over-the-hill centre backs but they do not need another one. United recruited Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven within seven months, Harry Maguire has had his contract extended while Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw could be permanently relocated to centre half.",
      "\"I've enjoyed it,\" Heaven said of his first four months at United. \"It's been tough, the team has really helped me to play my best and I just want to keep going next season.",
      "\"I always try my hardest when I play to impress people and I think I've been doing that. I just want to continue.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, should return well before the end of the calendar year. The 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson made a decent transition to the first team, albeit in relatively sedate circumstances (and two defeats).",
      "Talking about a lighter workload in relation to Shaw suggests a punchline is imminent. In all seriousness, with a reduced schedule Shaw could possibly hack it as a left winger if he improves his conditioning. United took a relative punt on Patrick Dorgu and it seems inevitable that the left wing will be a position to strengthen next year when Shaw has a year left on his contract (unless a club has taken him off United's hands by then).",
      "Shaw, 30 next month, started five games last season and all of them were at centre back. United lost four and, privately, Amorim must rue picking him in the Europa League final when his form and fitness did not merit that privilege.",
      "United cannot rely on Shaw, who has played in 27 out of 112 matches in the past two seasons. Harry Amass is a sprightlier left winger though there is significant risk in having a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old vying for such a demanding role with Mbeumo pencilled in on the other flank.",
      "Dorgu's first four months were mixed and one assist was a derisory return. It would not have helped that whenever he had the ball and looked up he saw either Rasmus Hojlund or Zirkzee. Dorgu will not be cut any more slack this time next year.",
      "Staff at United speak positively about the Dane's athleticism and his Serie A pedigree. \"It's been tough, challenging,\" Dorgu admitted. \"But I'm happy I played a lot.",
      "\"I think the manager trusts me and I try to help the team, so just happy to be on the pitch and I try to do my best over here.",
      "\"It's a bit different from my old team but I was playing attacking there as well. I just need to adapt to the players and how everyone moves on the pitch.",
      "\"It's obviously different because the fanbase is so massive. A lot of people talk! Everyone is talking about United. It is difficult for young players but I think if you have the right mentality I think everyone can cope with it and it's about performing on the pitch.\"",

Amorim told Garnacho he can go.",

      "Young United fans have idolised Rashford and many still do. He was not as domineering a presence as Paul Pogba during the club's player-power period or indulged as much as Anthony Martial, which made his transgressions under Amorim and Erik ten Hag - after the latter had restored authority to the United manager's role - so disappointing.",
      "After Sir Alex Ferguson did a U-turn and delayed his retirement in 2002, a United player turned to Dwight Yorke, in exile but optimistic ahead of the apparently impending managerial change. \"That's you f*****d, Yorkie.\" Yorke laughed. Rashford knows there is no route back at United with Amorim in charge.",
      "Ten Hag stood up to Cristiano Ronaldo, so Sancho was always going to be small-fry after he publicly accused the Dutchman of lying. Hardly any teammates sympathised with Sancho and urged him to reoncile with Ten Hag. He never did.",
      "Amorim looked bemused when he was incongruously asked in February whether Sancho could have a future at United. \"Jadon Sancho is not my problem.\" He is now.",
      "United need £14.58m to avoid a loss on Sancho under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. It was amusing, for a while, that Chelsea had agreed an obligation to pay up to £25m for Sancho until someone at Stamford Bridge reached for a calculator.",
      "Antony, La Liga-worthy and back in the Brazil squad, has a higher resale value than Sancho but only a handful of clubs would be in the market for the winger and have the financial wherewithal to hit the magic £32.52m mark. Antony has created a market for himself but United may have to tolerate another season-long loan, burnished by a loan fee and an obligation or option to buy.",
      "Of the four forwards in the departures' lounge, Garnacho is the most regrettable. He could not see the wood for the trees in the days leading up to the Europa League final, despite the giveaway that he would be benched when he was named as a substitute five days beforehand at Chelsea. That marked the first time he had been benched for successive games since January.",
      "Garnacho came on at 0-0, defended fecklessly for Marc Cucurella's winner, was rollocked by Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire and still got his hair bleached on the eve of the final. He very deliberately remained on the San Mames pitch, chewing the fat with Sergio Reguilon, as the United team was announced with all of his teammates were in the dressing room.",
      "Most United punters would have started Garnacho against Tottenham. That he didn't does not excuse his post-match petulance. Speaking in his native tongue, he cast doubt on his future.",
      "It felt telling that in the United corporate section for the semi-final at Athletic Bilbao, the only players whose agents were visibly present were Garnacho's and Kobbie Mainoo's. Garnacho's representatives, Enrique de Lucas and Carlos Cambeiro, appear to have been largely useless in advising their client on his social media etiquette. They made everyone aware they were at Chelsea in January when the club considered bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho all but confirmed his bench berth hours before the Europa League final with a passive aggressive post of his FA Cup final goal. He was at it again when United touched down in Manchester after the tempestuous post-season tour. Garnacho uploaded a picture of the Manchester Airport tarmac with the word \"Finally\", accompanied by crying-with-laughter and praying emojis. Whenever he grows up, it will be away from United.",
      "De Lucas and Cambeiro have allowed Garnacho's sense of entitlement to inflate. He and other puerile teammates had to be told to stop raising their middle fingers for photographs in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Garnacho left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium with sunglasses on at gone 11.30pm at night. He blanked everyone as he strolled through the mixed zone and he looked downright miserable when ordered to fulfil meet-and-greet duties post-match in Hong Kong.",
      "Pogba revelled in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter and was never disciplined. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was well-liked by United players but they also found him to be a soft touch. He had a tendency to squirm whenever the topic turned to Pogba.",
      "Rashford's working relationship with Solskjaer was not as rosy towards the end and he was particularly dismayed by the handling of his shoulder injury towards the end of the 2020-21 season. Solskjaer also sensed a shift in Rashford's demeanour amid a nationwide love-in over his free school meals campaign.",
      "United could not have foresawn Rashford's form nosediving after a career-best season but there were red flags. An antagonistic story the day after he was benched for the Manchester derby in March 2022, his brother's public dalliance with Paris Saint-Germain and a significant change to his entourage.",

      "After developing a habit of signing Dutch-centric under former boss Erik ten Hag, United's recruitment strategy is changing for the better this summer. After signing Cunha and now being in hot pursuit of Mbeumo, it is clear they want proven Premier League talent.",
      "In Cunha, United have secured the signature of a specialist No.10 who fits Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation like a glove. He also scored 15 Premier League goals last season.",
      "By signing a player who has already developed a respectable track record for cutting the mustard in England's top tier, United will be hoping he can hit the ground running at the start of next season.",
      "Expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 berth, Cunha will be responsible for creating goals and scoring them. He had a direct hand in 21 goals in 33 league appearances in 2024/25, assisting six in addition to the 15 he netted himself.",
      "Mbeumo, who is being targeted to play as the right-sided No.10, exceeded Cunha's tally by five, helping himself to 20 Premier League goals. Only Liverpool ace Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22) got more.",
      "Mbeumo was one of the stars of the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, and it is exciting and refreshing to see United in pursuit of one of the division's best players. If he arrives at Old Trafford, he will, just like Cunha, be expected to hit the ground running.",
      "However, neither of them spent last season at a club where the pressure can be comparable with what it is at Old Trafford. That will be a big test of their character.",
      "But with Cunha having made it clear he wanted to join United and no-one else this summer, and Mbeumo prepared to turn down a reunion with Thomas Frank at Tottenham Hotspur in favour of a move to Old Trafford, it says everything you need to know about their hunger to don the famous red shirt.",
      "Securing Mbeumo's signature would send out a real statement of intent. Although he is not the goalscorer United want to fill the No.9 spot, he would be joining them on the back of a 20-goal season, meaning they would expect him to contribute.",
      "United have not had a player score 20 Premier League goals or more in a single campaign since Robin van Persie plundered 26 in Sir Alex Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13. A club of United's stature should be able to rely on a 20-goal-a-season man.",
      "Both Bruno Fernandes and Cristiano Ronaldo went close to scoring 20 Premier League goals in a single season in recent years, each falling short by two in 2020/21 and 2021/22 respectively. Marcus Rashford scored 17 league goals when he scored 30 times across all competitions in 2022/23.",
      "If Mbeumo were to join United and get anywhere close to reaching 20 goals next season, he would instantly enter the conversation to be ranked as their best signing post-Ferguson. Just getting into double figures, particularly when he is not an out-and-out centre-forward, would be considered a success for a debut season at Old Trafford.",
      "United need a natural goalscorer this summer to shoulder the attacking burden, but having a player of Mbeumo's quality and capability in front of goal would ease the pressure. The same can be said of Cunha.",
      "With no United player having scored 20 league goals in a campaign for 12 years, Mbeumo would be a significant upgrade on their current attacking options."

      "After the report surrounding Gyokeres and his supposed decision to join Arsenal over United, it may now be time for the Reds to turn their focus back towards Osimhen.",

      "It feels like Osimhen has been almost forgotten this summer so maybe United have the chance to swoop in ahead of their rivals.",

      "That news is a hammer blow for Rashford who has been dreaming of a move to Camp Nou as his time at United looks to be at an end.",
      "With Williams on the way to signing, it now looks increasingly unlikely that the La Liga club will move for Rashford as well or, at the very least, he will not be seen as a priority.",
      "According to talkSPORT's Alex Crook, Gyokeres has told family and friends that he is expecting to join Arsenal in the transfer window.",
      "It is claimed that while he has a pre-existing relationship with Amorim, the desire to play in the Champions League is edging him towards north London.",

      "Kudus arrived at the Hammers in August 2023 and after a good debut campaign endured a difficult second season in East London.",

      "Speaking to Betway, Lescott explained:",
      "I don’t want to sound disrespectful, but I think they can replace him. I think they have a strong enough team and style, and I think Unai Emery’s proven that. They haven’t missed any player, really, they’ve been able to rotate, add, take away, suffer injuries. Martinez is top, very, very good, but I think if they acquire someone with experience, I think that’s key – the experience of who comes in to play that position, because they’re still relatively young at the back. That experience can add an amount of calm. I think it’s a loss, 100 per cent, but I don’t think it derails them where there’s question marks asked about whether they can achieve similar things to this season.",
      "A new twist in the Emi Martinez saga unfolded last night when it was reported by GiveMeSport that the Aston Villa goalkeeper had offered his services to United this summer.",
      "It is thought that Villa would be reluctant to see the Argentine leave their club but are wary of potentially breaching profit and sustainability rules if they do not sell him.",

      "No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al-Hilal… he must be waiting for Manchester United. I don’t know if Manchester United are going to come. That’s the problem.",
      "Malaysian media outlet Sabah understands that Osimhen is not currently interested in moving to either United or Arsenal this summer but has kept the door open for Chelsea.",
      "It is claimed that Galatasaray and Al Hilal are still frontrunners for his signature having both offered him lucrative salaries.",

      "\"We have brought in one player [Joan García] and we're working on another really exciting signing.\"",
      "He added: \"A lot of obstacles have been put in our way, but we have managed to overcome them,\" Laporta added.",

      "The 19-year-old spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan with Walsall, but struggled for game time. However, he is not thinking about his short term future.",
      "\"I’m just more concentrated on this tournament,\" he told PA Sport. “But, yeah, since [Ruben Amorim came in, I was away with international camp and, obviously, went on loan in January, so I’ve not really been around it too much.",
      "\"But I want to be a Man United player in the future. If that doesn’t happen, then it obviously wasn’t meant to be. We’ll just see what happens in the future.\"",
      "He added: \"Even if my first [loan move] didn’t go well - and it didn’t - I had it in the back of my head,\" he added. \"And I was telling staff around the club, it’s not going to define me as a player.",

      "\"We know with these clubs like Brentford, Brighton is always difficult to negotiate for their top players, so it's not easy to reach an agreement, but United are on that. They are talking to the club, always in contact with player agents, and with an agreement with Bryan Mbeumo, because the player wants to go to United.",

      "No.9, they already know who I want. The comments know, the people know who I want, who I would go and get: Osimhen! It looks like he’s turned down Al Hilal… he must be waiting for Man United. I don’t know if Man United are going to come. That’s the problem.",
      "Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the ex-United centre-back expressed his pleasure at the business that has been done and a deal that is expected to be done shortly.",
      "I’m happy with Cunha, he’s one of the ones I mentioned on my list. I hope it goes well for him. The problem is that I’ve been happy many times in transfer windows and it’s gone wrong. I’m hoping he’s not going to be added to that list. If they get Mbeumo, I’d be very happy because he wants to come. Mbeumo wants to come, I know it. His stats over the last three seasons in the Premier League are up there, by the way. Goals and assists, goal chances, ridiculous."

      "After Omar Berrada declared Manchester United would go in search of versatile players this summer, it is easy to understand why Bryan Mbeumo currently sits top of their wish list.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves earlier this month, United have earmarked Brentford star Mbeumo as their next target to go after in this summer's window.",
      "Despite seeing an opening offer worth £55million knocked back a fortnight ago, United are understood to still be in talks with Brentford over a deal. Furthermore, Mbeumo is just as keen to get a deal over the line.",
      "It is thought Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to the one United paid Wolves to sign Cunha (£62.5m), although he was attainable via a release clause. That made the deal relatively straightforward to get done.",
      "Despite interest from Tottenham Hotspur, who recently appointed former Brentford chief Thomas Frank as their new boss, Mbeumo has told confidants that he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer. It is players of his character and mentality United need.",
      "Mbeumo enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 20 Premier League goals, meaning his stock is at an all-time high. He would boost United's chances of increasing their attacking output and would offer a sense of the versatility Berrada believes United need.",
      "Mbeumo, if signed, would be able to operate as a right wing-back, a right-sided No.10 and potentially as a striker. He would tick plenty of boxes.",
      "But with United keen to move at speed this summer, in terms of securing incomings and overseeing outgoings, they may have to keep other options in mind if talks over Mbeumo do not progress as quickly as they would like them to.",
      "According to a report by The Guardian, United have expressed interest in West Ham United ace Mohammed Kudus. It is claimed United, Chelsea, Newcastle United and another unnamed Premier League club are keen on his signature.",
      "It has been widely reported in recent weeks the Ghanaian wants to leave West Ham this summer and open a new chapter. Despite links with a move to Saudi Arabia, he is not keen on a move to that part of the world at this stage in his career.",
      "Kudus has an £85m release clause in his Hammers contact that will reportedly become active for Premier League clubs for the first ten days of July. However, the Hammers are keen to cut their cloth this summer and raise funds via player sales, meaning they may be prepared to negotiate a lower selling price.",
      "A £65m fee has been mooted and that would represent a more realistic valuation of the 24-year-old, who was on United's radar back in 2022 when at Ajax. Despite not scoring 20 goals like Mbeumo did in 2024/25, Kudus has a lot of similar characteristics.",
      "Just like the Brentford ace, he is extremely versatile and likes to drift into central positions when tasked with starting out wide. He has pace, power and the ability to make something happen in the blink of an eye.",
      "Although his second season in England was nowhere near as fruitful as his first, which produced 14 goals and nine assists, he is still a player of great quality. Admitting he prefers to play as a No.10, he would be a tailor-made fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Mbeumo ought to remain United's priority target in their search for a right-sided option, but Kudus should be considered as an alternative option if a deal for the former cannot be reached. However, the Reds are unlikely to entertain Kudus' £85m release clause."

      "The 20-year-old left back started in 18 out of a possible 23 games following his arrival, including all seven Europa League knockout ties.",
      "Dorgu is set to remain a starter on the left wing for United at the start of next season and he admitted his first four months at the club had been \"tough\" and \"difficult\".",

      "\"It's a bit different from my old team but I was playing attacking there as well. I just need to adapt to the players and how everyone moves on the pitch.",

      "Ayden Heaven was technically the first recruit under Amorim in February after he joined from Arsenal's academy. Heaven made one substitute appearance for the Gunners before he moved to United for a knockdown £1.5m compensation fee.",
      "The 18-year-old came on in the FA Cup fifth round tie with Fulham and emerged against his former club in the Premier League a week later before making his full debut in the Europa League round-of-16 second leg against Real Sociedad.",

      "He joined West Ham from Ajax in August 2023 for £38m and enjoyed an outstanding debut season in England, scoring 14 goals and registering nine assists. He often flexed vis versatility in his first season at the London Stadium, playing through the middle and out wide, but with a tendency to drift inside.",
      "\"Recently, I've played on the wings or even as a striker sometimes but I've always been a midfielder.\"",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's appointment as head coach last November, United immediately transitioned to a 3-4-2-1 formation, meaning the centre-forward is supported by two attacking-midfielders. Cunha has been recruited for the left-sided No.10 spot and Mbeumo is being targeted to play in the right-sided role.",
      "Kudus, though, would be a suitable alternative to Mbeumo if a deal for the latter fails to materialise. United saw an opening offer worth £55m for the Brentford ace turned down earlier this month.",
      "Kudus' second season in England was nowhere near as fruitful as his first, with his 35 appearances yielding just five goals and four assists. However, at the age of 24, there is still plenty of time for him to work on his consistency.",
      "The attacker, who was on United's radar back in 2022, is also extremely versatile, capable of playing on the left, the right or through the middle. He would tick a lot of boxes if the price could be driven down."

      "Manchester United fans have already ticked first signing and new home kit revealed off their summer bingo cards and they have now managed to cross off another milestone on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Premier League released their fixture list for the 2025/26 campaign with some of the biggest matches of the season not far away for the Reds. The first Manchester derby of the season will be on matchday four while a trip to Everton's new stadium is delayed until February.",
      "However, on the opening weekend, no match will be anticipated more than the clash between United and Arsenal at Old Trafford. It will be an interesting test to see whether or not Ruben Amorim's newly rebuilt squad can challenge with a side who are desperate to go one step better next season and win the Premier League.",
      "Before they can think too hard about that, Amorim and Ineos will need to make new additions to their squad. MEN Sport has taken a look at how the Reds could line up to face Arsenal if they enjoy their dream summer between now and then.",
      "Goalkeeper - Emiliano Martinez",
      "Andre Onana is not expected to depart Old Trafford this summer and there is a strong chance that he will be in goal as first-choice by the time the Premier League returns. However, the arrival of Martinez from Aston Villa would give the Cameroonian some much-needed incentive to become more consistent.",
      "It would be some Premier League debut for Martinez too, considering his ties to Arsenal and the manner in which he left the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Defenders - Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire",
      "No new faces in the back three but that's not always a bad thing. United will need some stability heading into next season and these three, when fit, are arguably the best choices available to Amorim.",
      "Ayden Heaven would be a good option to come in if needed. As would Lisandro Martinez but, unfortunately, the Argentine will be missing the opening months of the season.",
      "Wing-backs - Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu",
      "This is potentially the most difficult position on the pitch to choose heading into next season. Noussair Mazraoui and Amad will feel hard done by for missing out but before a pre-season ball has been kicked, you would feel that Dalot and Dorgu are the options Amorim will go for.",
      "Central midfielders - Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes",
      "Due to the potential new signings, we can expect Fernandes to take up a deeper No.8 role next season rather than featuring as a No.10. The captain was the only reliable cog for Amorim this season gone, and you would expect him to fit seamlessly alongside either Casemiro or Manuel Ugarte.",
      "We have chosen the Brazilian as his performances at the end of this season were perhaps more consistent. But that selection alongside Fernandes is up for grabs.",
      "Attacking midfielders - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Spoiler alert, the remaining players in this dream XI are all fresh additions. Cunha is already in the squad and having signed so early, you would expect him to slot straight into the team.",
      "Mbeumo remains a transfer that United are confident in making and between the two of them, they bring 37 goals from this season into the side which is desperately needed.",
      "Striker - Viktor Gyokeres",
      "He's the man that Amorim wants to lead the line more than anyone else next season. Gyokeres looks destined to leave Sporting and Arsenal's interest in him is on shaky ground right now.",
      "You would feel that if it is not going to be the Swede, it will be a new signing of some description leading the line. Rasmus Hojlund's future looks in doubt while Joshua Zirkzee's career at United looks better suited to a No.10 role."

      "Still, Man Utd are far from the stage where they can secure a £100m+ statement signing, a la Liverpool with Florian Wirtz, but this has not prevented the Spanish press from spouting some fanatical nonsense regarding a move for Raphinha.",
      "The former Leeds United star is a credible contender for this year’s Ballon d’Or, so a downwards step to Man Utd should be the furthest thing from his mind.",
      "Despite this, a recent report claimed Man Utd have tested the waters with an audacious £127m bid for Raphinha, and an update on Thursday suggested some ‘voices’ at Barcelona consider this to be the ‘perfect move’.",
      "It does not take a genius to work out that the Red Devils realistically have no chance of signing Raphinha at this point, but he is at least said to be ‘very upset and annoyed’ at Barcelona.",

Although he hasn’t submitted a formal request to leave, he has made it clear that if he loses prominence in the coming months, he will seriously consider his future. The situation has generated tension within the Barcelona team.’",

      "Because while in general it remains open to debate whether you’d prefer a tough start and easier run-in or vice versa, when it comes to sorting out which manager might be the first one sent packing, there is a clear preference.",
      "So let’s rank the whole lot of them – minus Brentford, on the surely reasonable basis that we don’t know who their manager will actually be – on how likely (or otherwise) they are to win the race that nobody wants to win.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "19) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "18) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s essentially no chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five.",
      "",
      "17) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "16) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "15) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "14) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nSee Marco Silva.",
      "",
      "13) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "12) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "10) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "9) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "Dunno, so it’s into mid-table Maresca must slot. He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of this list but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "What you may notice we’ve cleverly avoided here is any attempt at predicting what we actually think Man United will actually do next season in terms of being good/bad/indifferent. And that’s because we genuinely have not one clue. Could be anything, couldn’t they?",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "6) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, but again, that doesn’t really matter for our purposes. Arteta’s is a quirky situation where the range of possible outcomes is such that he sits uncommonly prominently in this list but would be even closer to the top of any possible manager of the year list.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "5) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games, Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo. There’s also the added early-season headache of those Conference League qualifiers, too, which none of our other European entrants have to worry themselves with.",
      "",
      "4) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack. As with Arteta – perhaps even more so – what we’re doing here isn’t quite as straightforward as ‘do you think this manager will do well or what’.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "1) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have been dealt a major blow as head coach Mikel Arteta is ‘set’ to lose a key member of his staff in a ‘record’ deal.",
      "Premier League runners-up Arsenal have been told it would be “crazy” to spend £85m on a player who is unproven in the Premier League this summer.",
      "The Premier League’s top two will have to keep their options open when it comes to acquiring a new striker in the summer transfer window.",
      "Arsenal have now pulled out of a deal to sign Viktor Gyokeres after making a £59m bid for the Sporting CP striker earlier this week, according to reports.",

Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",

The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",

      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",

      "But it was the length of Guerrero’s ban that proved to be one of the more interesting aspects of the case. Initially, FIFA gave him a 12-month ban but their appeals committee reduced it to six.",

Off the back of Argentina’s 2-1 World Cup group stage win over Nigeria, Maradona was selected for a drugs test and pinged for five variants of ephedrine, a stimulant banned by FIFA.",

      "Trenter the dragon\n‘Trent Alexander-Arnold makes underwhelming start to life at Real Madrid at Club World Cup’ was the headline in the Mirror, while we concluded that it ‘wasn’t great’ as we detailed everything he did – there really wasn’t much – against Al-Hilal.",

      "Take a guess which newspaper/website is boycotted by Liverpool fans.",
      "‘Here’s why the ex-Liverpool star can be quietly pleased with his debut in the Miami heat,’ say The Sun. And we really want to know why, because a 1-1 draw with Al-Hilal is really quite embarrassing for Real Madrid. And we know that he did something close to the square root of f*** all in that 1-1 draw.",
      "‘An attacking threat?’ ask The Sun. Well, he created the sum total of one chance in 64 minutes so we would say not. Football Espana say ‘he struggled to make an impact in attack before being substituted’ and the statistics certainly back that up.",
      "But according to The Sun: ‘It was his initial pass deep in his own half that started the move which ended with Gonzalo Garcia’s 34th-minute opener. The England international pumped his fists into the air when the ball hit the back of the net.’",
      "Ah, the glorious pre-pre-pre-pre-assist. He really is ‘already showing signs of old class’.",
      "The Sun then note that he ‘looked defensively solid’. Which is true if you ignore all the times he failed to track his winger, the time he was outjumped at a corner, the times players drifted past him (he did not make one tackle) and the time he appeared to entirely forget he was a defender. Apart from all that, he ‘looked defensively solid’.",

But even if the TV bosses take up their full allocation, it would mean no more than five top-flight games played on Boxing Day.’",

      "Ruben Amorim is working closely with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to rebuild an ailing Manchester United squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",

      "They’ve had one bid rejected for Bryan Mbeumo of £55m plus a further £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford, and are considering an improved bid amid competition from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham.",
      "According to a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes on Monday the Red Devils have made a genuinely unbelievable ‘offer of €150m [£127m] for Raphinha’, having found some loose change down the back of one of their canteen chairs now collecting dust in a warehouse.",
      "‘The figure has surprised even in the Camp Nou offices’ the report claimed, ‘where a proposal of such magnitude was not expected by the Brazilian winger’.",

      "‘The board, headed by Joan Laporta and Deco, is now at a crossroads: continue betting on a player who is at his peak of performance or accepting an offer that could mark a before and after in the club’s economy. Internally, there are already voices that consider that selling Raphinha for that amount would be a perfect move and that it would happen at the right time, even if Flick continues to be inflexible’",
      "That report comes as transfer expert Fabrizio Romano confirmed the Catalans have reached an agreement with Nico Williams for the winger to join the club this summer in a huge blow for Arsenal.",
      "He wrote in X: ‘Nico Williams and Barça have agreed personal terms on 6 year deal! Agreement sealed on player’s contract until June 2031 with the salary in the region of €7/8m net per season. Barça are currently working on financial terms to get deal done with Athletic.’",
      "While it’s not yet clear how long Barcelona will look to spread out the payments for Williams, the Spain international’s release clause stands at €58m [£49.5m], which is cash they don’t have on hand but would do if they accept United’s mammoth and genuinely unbelievable ‘offer’ for Raphinha.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Liverpool\nApparently, Liverpool were looking to offer Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa to Napoli in exchange for the Nigeria striker. Which actually makes sense. We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. That could still happen, but more likely now as a stand-alone deal.",
      "",
      "19)  Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Napoli\nWe almost want this to happen just to see Antonio Conte’s head fall off by Christmas. We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli. And reports suggest he has no intention of lowering his demands. Another loan beckons.",

Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",

United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",

But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle.

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",

Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",

      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",

United remained confident of getting their man, but decisive action appears scarce. They were expected to make a second offer to Brentford a week ago, but we know not how much or if it was ever submitted.",

Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",

There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. So why the wait? Zubimendi is in the middle of three-week FIFA-mandated holiday, while reports suggest both clubs would prefer for the deal to go through the books in July.",

But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder.

      "According to reports, Viktor Gyokeres feels ‘betrayed’ as he has ‘rejected’ a meeting, while Arsenal have made a decision on meeting his asking price.",
      "Those already bored of this transfer saga better brace themselves for it to drag on for a while longer…",
      "Gyokeres is among this year’s top scorers in Europe and has attracted interest from clubs across Europe in recent months.",
      "The former Coventry City star has been a revelation since joining Sporting Lisbon, grabbing 97 goals and 28 assists in 102 appearances for the Primeira Liga champions.",
      "Despite this, Gyokeres hoped for a smooth exit from Sporting Lisbon this summer as it’s been reported for months that he has a gentleman’s agreement to leave for around 70 million euros.",
      "However, Gyokeres’ relationship with Sporting Lisbon has deteriorated, with club chiefs deciding to demand a much higher fee. It is now being suggested that it could cost as much as 100 million euros to sign him.",
      "READ: Arsenal targets dominate list of the best available strikers this summer",
      "This is currently impacting Gyokeres’ hopes of leaving Sporting Lisbon as Arsenal and Manchester United are yet to meet his asking price.",
      "Arsenal and Man Utd are crying out for a new striker and they have been mooted as the most likely Premier League clubs to sign Gyokeres this summer.",
      "The Gunners are also linked with Benjamin Sesko. Conflicting reports have emerged on who they prefer to sign, but a report from journalist Alfredo Pedulla claims Gyokeres has been their first choice for a while.",
      "“I’ve known for a month that the first choice for Arsenal in the striker position is Gyokeres,” Pedulla told The Italian Football Podcast.",

      "“Then there were all the issues between the president of Sporting Lisbon and Gyokeres’ agent (over the alleged promises about his asking price).",
      "“Andrea Berta, the new Arsenal sporting director, prefers Gyokeres over Sesko. Many say that Sesko is the first choice of Arsenal. This is not the news I have. Gyokeres is Arsenal’s priority.",
      "“Gyokeres is possible [for Juventus] if Arsenal withdraw [from the race]. Juventus cannot compete with Arsenal.”",
      "Still, Arsenal could easily miss out on Gyokeres this summer, as a new report from Portuguese outlet Record claims they are not currently to pay more than 55 million euros as an initial package.",
      "This opens the door for a hijack, with the report noting that Serie A giants Juventus are stepping up their interest in Gyokeres, who has ‘rejected’ the opportunity to have a meeting with Sporting Lisbon chiefs.",
      "It is said that the striker feels ‘betrayed’ by his current club and currently has no intention to build bridges as he looks to force a summer exit.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United target Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly decided to ‘refuse’ a move to one club as he has chosen his ‘above all dream’ transfer.",
      "Put yourself in Andrea Berta’s shiny, handcrafted brogues and tell us which striker you would sign for Arsenal this summer…",
      "A new report has revealed Arsenal’s striker “priority” during this summer’s transfer window, with a journalist revealing what he’s “known for a month”.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "The longer Viktor Gyokeres’ future remains undecided, the more clubs join Arsenal in pursuing an interest in one of Europe’s most potent strikers.",
      "Arsenal are in ‘advanced talks’ over signing a new striker as a fresh report has revealed sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘plan’ in an ‘unusual approach’."

      "A transfer insider has suggested that the impending signing of Bryan Mbeumo at Manchester United means there’s a “limited” chance their top scorer keeps his role, but he feels he’ll be “immense” elsewhere.",
      "United have already moved to rectify their forward issues this summer. Last season, during their 15th-placed Premier League campaign, they scored 44 goals in 38 games.",
      "They have signed Matheus Cunha to add some firepower, and Bryan Mbeumo could follow, after 20 goals for Brentford last season.",
      "There’s a battle ongoing between United and Tottenham for the forward, but it’s believed Mbeumo wants to join the Red Devils, while a recent report suggested Spurs had ‘cooled’ their interest as they saw the deal to beat the rival side as ‘impossible’.",
      "That signing, and other United decisions, while push Amad Diallo out of his role, according to insider Graeme Bailey.",
      "He told TBRFootball: “Amad probably knows he’s heading towards playing the right wing-back role.",
      "“If you recall, in [Ruben] Amorim’s first game in charge against Ipswich Town, that’s where Amad played. When he says right wing-back role, a wing-back role in a Ruben Amorim system is not the wing-back role that we usually associate with English football.",
      "“I think the Cunha and Mbeumo signings, and [Joshua] Zirkzee still being there, tell us that the chances of Amad playing as an attacking midfielder are quite limited next season.",
      "“We might see Amad play in that right-side role, that’s what [the transfer moves] are telling us. We know Amad is prepared to play there, he’s done it a number of times for Amorim, and let’s not forget the players who played that position for Amorim – [Geovany] Quenda at Sporting and look how good he is. He’s not a dissimilar type of player.",
      "“It tells us that, while he likely won’t play an attacking-midfield role at United, Amad is still very much in Amorim’s thinking. It’s a position, if they do it right, he’ll become an immense threat in, that [right wing-back] role.”",
      "Diallo was United’s joint-top scorer in the Premier League last season, with eight goals alongside eight assists, and a nunber of those came from the attack.",
      "However, he also showed he was capable of starring in the wing-back position. Amad scored a hat-trick against Southampton in a game he started as a wing-back, and there were more goals and assists in other games he played there, too.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the striker he “wants” the Red Devils to sign is “waiting” for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are among the three clubs in the race to sign Nottingham Forest standout Callum Hudson-Odoi.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have edged closer to making their next signing as Tottenham Hotspur have ‘cooled’ their interest.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur are ‘growing in confidence’ as they look to sign a Premier League winger also linked with Manchester United.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is a player in demand and Tottenham Hotspur’s appointment of Thomas Frank might have affected Manchester United’s hopes of making him their next big summer signing."

      "Manchester United have been handed a boost in their bid to sign a replacement for Andre Onana as a £40m star has ‘offered himself’ to the Red Devils in a ‘major twist’.",
      "It was claimed back in April that Onana had been ‘sentenced’ to the Old Trafford exit, with Nice’s Marcin Bułka and Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez among a whole host of goalkeepers linked with a move to replace the Cameroonian.",
      "But transfer expert Ben Jacobs told GIVEMESPORT last week that the United bosses hadn’t yet decided whether to source a new stopper or retain Onana as first choice.",
      "The report stated:",
      "‘Onana went on holiday focused on Manchester United as he has not been warned that he is for sale or at risk of losing his regular starting berth, GMS sources understand, but influential figures are assessing the market and will communicate their decision to him after the initial plan was to bring in a replacement for Altay Bayindir ahead of his expected exit.’",
      "A report on Monday then claimed that they have made their minds up, or rather Amorim has made the decision for them – Onana will remain United’s No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Portuguese boss has ‘conveyed to the board his intention to count on him as a key piece in his project’ and ‘does not contemplate any other alternative’.",
      "It’s claimed Amorim ‘trusts’ Onana and still sees him as the ‘ideal profile’ to build from the back thanks to his ‘technical conditions and ability to play with his feet’.",
      "He insists that Onana can ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure and a well-defined idea of the game’, but the United boss may have his head turned now that Villa’s Martinez ‘has offered himself’ to the club.",
      "GIVEMESPORT claim the World Cup winner wants to join the Red Devils and that Villa ‘have refused to rule out reluctantly granting his wish due to fears of breaching the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules’.",
      "Martinez looked as though he was waving goodbye to the Villa fans after victory over Tottenham last month in their final home game of the season and ‘in a major twist, Martinez has made it clear that he is willing to join Manchester United if they make an approach’.",
      "The report claims Villa want £40m for the 32-year-old as they use AC Milan’s £25m valuation of Mike Maignan amid interest from Chelsea in the France international, ‘complicating matters for Manchester United and Martinez’, though it’s thought Villa do need to sanction big sales amid their PSR concerns.",
      "Maignan has just a year left to run on his deal while Martinez is under contract at Villa park until 2029.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘GMS sources have been informed that Manchester United have still not made a final call on whether to sign a new first-choice option between the sticks or if Andre Onana is surplus to requirements, while Atletico Madrid has been pinpointed as another possible destination for Martinez if Jan Oblak leaves.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their ‘preferred’ replacement for Andre Onana and all parties are open to the transfer.",
      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘initiated talks’ to sign an elite goalkeeper target, after an ‘agreement’ killed the chances of a Barcelona deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been forced to hatch a new ‘plan’ as they look to replace current No.1 Andre Onana.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly looking to bring in a new goalkeeper over the summer with the Red Devils turning their attention to a Poland international."

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for five of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Joan Garcia – £21.3m/€25m (Espanyol to Barcelona, June 2025)\nArsenal were known to be sniffing around but with Barcelona eager to enact a Ter Stegen succession plan, they triggered Garcia’s release clause to make their first signing direct from Espanyol in 31 years.",
      "",
      "19) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "20) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",

Of course, both players are Manchester United players, so it would not be a deal that would be unfamiliar to either club and could suit both if the fee is right. I’m not sure if it would be a permanent buy with an option to send him back with a fee, or a straight loan with an option/obligation.",

      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes, starting with two City cast-offs…",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker to Everton\nWalker might be past his best, but there’s no doubt he would improve the Everton back-line. And he’d fit in perfectly as another old fogey in a defence that’s already home to Seamus Coleman, who turns 37 in October. Walker turned 35 in May, while Nathan Patterson, 12 years his junior, remains awfully injury-prone.",
      "The England right-back would have to take a pay-cut to join Everton, but his desire to stay in Thomas Tuchel’s England squad trumps money, amid reported interest from Fenerbahce. That ambition paid off in January when the Manchester City defender chose AC Milan over Saudi Arabia, and has been rewarded with a 100% call-up rate under the new England boss. The same logic could apply if Walker joins Everton and performs at a decent level.",
      "He’s desperate to reach 100 caps. And while Fenerbahce are hardly a nothing club that would ruin those hopes, proving he can still cut it in the Premier League (not the Turkish Super Lig) would be far more beneficial to that end.",
      "As for Everton, there’s obviously some risk given Walker’s recent decline. But he’s still an upgrade on Coleman and Patterson, though the latter’s potential is miles beyond Walker’s current level.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish to Everton\nSticking with Manchester City players moving to Everton’s shiny new stadium, we’re very intrigued by the prospect of Grealish making this move.",
      "There’s reportedly interest from Serie A champions Napoli, which is obviously the better option, unless he doesn’t want to leave England. Grealish would be a pretty like-for-like replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who left Naples for Paris Saint-Germain in January, and the move would ensure he’s playing Champions League football next season.",
      "However, this is all about intra-Premier League transfers, so enough of that Italian muck. If recent rumours are anything to go by, Everton are showing real ambition ahead of their move from Goodison Park to the Hill Dickinson Stadium, with new owners the Friedkin Group keen to usher in a new era with better players. It makes sense; and if Man City can ship both Grealish and Walker off to Merseyside on permanent deals, they’ll be thrilled.",
      "We miss the old Grealish and reckon David Moyes might give him the freedom to express himself, even though his wingers do have defensive duties. Show him the love and let him thrive in the final third, and Grealish will repay it by tracking back and doing his bit in the low block. We really hope he stays in the Premier League.",

      "Raheem Sterling to Fulham\nChelsea and their latest bomb squad deserve their own feature, but for now, we’re trying to work out where the hell Raheem Sterling ends up after an underwhelming loan spell at Arsenal.",
      "“People like to talk, don’t they? Well so do I. And I’ll say this – you’re about to see the best of me,” Sterling said after joining the Gunners on deadline day last August. No further comment.",
      "He scored a single goal (against League One Bolton) in 28 matches for Arsenal, and it’s clear his days of playing for a top club are behind him after spells with Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City.",
      "The 82-cap England international needs a fresh start, but we also reckon staying in London could be a crucial factor in where he goes next. He seems quite Fulham, doesn’t he? At Craven Cottage, Sterling can quietly go about his business and either score two in 30 or 15 in 30, and nobody would really bat an eyelid. Though the latter might even be enough to get him back into the England squad.",
      "Marco Silva needs to bolster his attack, particularly on the left, and if Sterling’s wage demands are realistic, the 30-year-old could enjoy a renaissance for Chelsea’s west London neighbours.",
      "",
      "Sean Longstaff to Leeds\nPlenty of Newcastle supporters will be happy to see Longstaff go, though there’ll be a few staunch Geordies upset to lose a homegrown player.",
      "What’s certain is that Eddie Howe’s Newcastle have outgrown him. Rumours of a move to Leeds make sense for both Daniel Farke and the player. He’s not the most exciting addition, but Premier League experience will be crucial if any of the promoted trio are to buck the trend and avoid the drop. Signing a bunch of youngsters from abroad isn’t going to cut it.",
      "Longstaff will run all day, and that sort of effort will quickly win over the Elland Road faithful. He can chip in with goals and is comfortable enough on the ball to hold his own in midfield for a newly promoted side.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Tottenham Hotspur\nGarnacho to Chelsea has been six months in the making, but at this point, he’s nothing more than an alternative to Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens. A move to the aforementioned Napoli now seems far more likely for the Argentine.",
      "With that in mind, we’ve gone with a transfer to Spurs, who are expected to miss out on Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, now bound for Manchester United.",
      "Six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League games in 2024/25 was an underwhelming return for a player tipped to become a star at Old Trafford. Even at 20, he needs a fresh start, and Ruben Amorim has reportedly made it clear that’s exactly what he should pursue.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez to Arsenal\nA transfer feature isn’t really a transfer feature without linking Arsenal with a striker. Darwin is admittedly a left-field option for Mikel Arteta, but the Spaniard’s eclectic transfer record means we wouldn’t put it past him. If he can turn Kai Havertz into a competent centre-forward, he might back himself to do the same with the Liverpool maverick.",
      "Arsenal are crying out for an elite striker, and that’s exactly what Nunez was supposed to be at Anfield. Perhaps under different management and in a more structured system, he could still become that.",

      "Marcus Rashford to Liverpool\nThis is another left-field ‘hear us out’ shout, but one we’re fully behind for multiple reasons, the most compelling of which is that it’d be really very funny.",
      "Arne Slot is thought to be prioritising a more natural striker than a wide forward, but Rashford is capable of playing through the middle – more so than Cody Gakpo or Luis Diaz, anyway. And with the latter being targeted by Barcelona, a cut-price Rashford could be the ideal signing to maintain the depth that helped Liverpool cruise to the Premier League title.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko to Brentford\nClearly in need of a left-back – having used Keane Lewis-Potter there for much of last season – Brentford could do a lot worse than Zinchenko. The Ukrainian is renowned for his world-class technical ability, even if his defending remains a concern.",
      "A move abroad still looks the likeliest outcome, but with a year left on his contract, Arsenal are desperate to sell this summer, opening the door for a surprise Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "Joao Felix to Wolves\nPortuguese? Check. Jorge Mendes client? You bet. Surplus to requirements at his current club? Absolutely. Welcome to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Joao Felix.",
      "We’ve already endorsed a move to Leeds, so it’s abundantly clear where we think his level is now after disappointing spells with Chelsea, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid. He’s still technically a Blues player but is certain to leave permanently this summer. Saudi Arabia feels extremely likely for the failed wonderkid, but the most plausible Premier League landing spot for him is Portugal C Wolves.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho to Crystal Palace\nAssuming they will be playing in Europe next season (these things always work themselves out), Palace will need a bit more depth across the pitch. They should feel confident going into a Europa League campaign with a manager who’s won the competition, and adding someone like Sancho would only add to that confidence.",
      "Sancho might think FA Cup winners Palace are beneath him, but we’re not so sure. He doesn’t have a future at Manchester United – even if Ruben Amorim hasn’t tried him out yet – and he flopped on loan at Chelsea, who paid £5m to send him back.",

      "Omar Berrada: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it?\"",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",

      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
