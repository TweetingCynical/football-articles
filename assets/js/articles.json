      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick is familiar with Hayden Hackney(Image: Craig Thomas)",
      "Manchester United boss Michael Carrick is understood to be a big fan of Middlesbrough midfielder Hayden Hackney. Following speculation linking the 23-year-old with a switch to Old Trafford, Hackney has now spoken about what lies ahead.",
      "Carrick has taken charge of his former side for a second time following Ruben Amorim's sacking and has already secured wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. His previous role saw him spend nearly three years as Middlesbrough manager.",
      "Throughout that period, the 44-year-old worked closely with Hackney. The midfielder has attracted top-flight interest for a while now, and Carrick's arrival has only intensified speculation connecting him with United.",
      "However, Hackney has now broken his silence on a possible January switch, clarifying his situation at Middlesbrough and putting paid to any last-minute plans Carrick might have had.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "After 30 Championship fixtures, Middlesbrough occupy a share of top spot with Premier League promotion within reach. They edged past Norwich 1-0 on Saturday in a crucial encounter, with skipper Hackney scoring the decisive goal.",
      "Speaking afterwards, Hackney was questioned about his future and left little doubt about his transfer intentions. Asked whether he would be departing before the deadline, he replied: \"No. I'm really happy.",
      "The 23-year-old scored his side's winner against Norwich(Image: Getty)",
      "\"The manager [Kim Hellberg] has got me playing the way I enjoy playing, getting the best out of me. So yeah, I'm really enjoying it. This is what I've wanted to do ever since I was a kid: play for Middlesbrough.",
      "\"And where we are in the league at the minute, as long as we just keep going, we feel confident. Winning promotion with Middlesbrough would mean everything to me. I don't know how I'd be, but I know I'd be over the moon. That is the dream.\"",
      "This development will serve as a minor setback for Carrick, who has previously heaped praise on Hackney. During his time at Middlesbrough in 2024, Carrick lauded the midfielder's qualities.",
      "\"You couldn't ask for much more from Hayden,\" Carrick remarked two years ago. \"He's grounded, he's humble, he's down to earth and loves to learn. He loves the place and he loves the club as well. To have that, added with the talent he has got, it's the perfect scenario. I think it just shows his consistency really, over a long period of time.",
      "Hackney played under Carrick(Image: PA)",
      "\"It's not easy when you're a younger player, but he's certainly done that. There is a level of talent out there in and around football and sometimes it might not be that different player to player, but levels can be jumped, or not, if your head is not in the right place and you don't go about your business in the right way and treat your profession with respect.",
      "\"Hayden certainly does that. He's been exemplary really since I've been here and I really enjoy working with him. He's desperate for more, desperate to learn, and he's a real credit to his family, to himself and to the club.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford was on the scoresheet for a second game in a row(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford is continuing to prove his worth to Barcelona as uncertainty surrounds his future ahead of the summer transfer window. The Manchester United forward, currently on loan at the LaLiga champions until the end of the season, is making a strong case for a permanent move with his impressive performances.",
      "Rashford netted Barca's third goal in their 3-1 victory over Elche on Saturday, helping to restore their four-point advantage over Real Madrid at the summit. After replacing Raphinha in the 46th minute, the 28-year-old was a constant threat and got his reward by firing home from close range, just moments after squandering a one-on-one opportunity.",
      "Despite the win, Barca manager Hansi Flick criticised his team's failure to put the game to bed, stating: \"We can't keep missing these chances. It's good that we created so many chances, but we needed to finish off the game in the first half and score many more goals.",
      "\"This is always our focus. We want to win every match. It's good to see this, and we're happy to play with confidence and play so well.\" If the Catalan club opts to sign Rashford permanently, there have been tentative suggestions that a deal could involve Marc Casado, who Man United are reportedly interested in acquiring.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "However, whilst any talk of a swap deal has been dismissed by Hansi Flick, who insisted the young midfielder won't be departing the club, the future of the United loanee remains uncertain. Rashford's strike against Elche, along with the lift he provided when introduced, has now become a talking point amongst Spanish journalists.",
      "Writing in Marca, Fernando Carnerero commended Barcelona's determination to see out the match despite squandering numerous clear-cut opportunities against Elche. The opposition's threat on the break presented a genuine challenge for the visitors, but that was nullified by Rashford's goal which followed a \"great run\" by Lamine Yamal.",
      "He wrote: \"Barca missed another chance to seal the victory when Rashford went one-on-one with the Englishman, but his shot went well wide. Flick's men were still playing with fire with 20 minutes remaining. Elche had another good opportunity, but Álvaro Rodríguez couldn't quite reach it and Eric García cleared it for a corner.",
      "\"However, Alejandro Muñiz signalled for a goal kick, and from that corner came Rashford's goal to make it 3-1 after a great run by Lamine Yamal. The goal was vehemently protested by the Elche players and resulted in a yellow card for Sarabia.\"",
      "Javier Gascon from Mundo Deportivo may have criticised Rashford for spurning a golden chance before his goal, but conceded redemption arrived through his strike which sealed Barcelona's triumph. The Spanish publication also provided individual player ratings for everyone who took part in the match, including Rashford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He was described as an 'opportunist' following his performance during the 45 minutes he was on the pitch. The report stated: \"He came on after halftime to attack the spaces.",
      "\"Like all his teammates, he missed an unforgivable goal in a one-on-one with Peña. He made amends, scoring the third goal with a clinical finish into an empty net. Peña then denied him a fourth goal.\"",
      "The England international received high praise from Santi Gimenez in his assessment for AS too. The journalist identified Rashford's second-half introduction as the turning point that reignited Barcelona's hopes.",
      "He stated: \"But it was Rashford who breathed life into Barcelona thanks to another moment of brilliance from Lamine Yamal, who, from outside the pitch, prevented the ball from going out of play with a header, controlled it and assisted the Englishman, who unleashed a furious shot into the net, fuelled by the frustration of someone who, like so many others, had missed sitters.\"",

Holland was confirmed in his new position at Old Trafford earlier this month as part of the backroom team put together by Michael Carrick, who is the interim first-team head coach until the end of this season.",
      "The 55-year-old previously served as assistant manager to England boss Gareth Southgate between 2016 and 2024, a period during which the Three Lions reached two major tournament finals.",
      "Following the Euro 2024 loss to Spain and Southgate's departure, Holland was named as head coach of J1 League side Yokohama F. Marinos, where he was dismissed in April of last year.",

My wife still reminds me of that regularly.\"",
      "Villas-Boas was axed after nine months back in 2012 but Holland retained his position. The subsequent boss, Roberto di Matteo, claimed the Champions League but was shown the door after merely eight months.",
      "Steve Holland spent six years as Chelsea's assistant manager(Image: Julian Finney/Getty)",

      "It's been over 20 years since Wayne joined United in 2004, later becoming the club's greatest-ever goalscorer with 253 goals in 559 appearances. When he hung up his boots in 2021, he also held the distinction of being England's all-time top scorer.",
      "With his dad having carved out such a remarkable legacy, Kai's young career naturally invites comparison. Yet Wayne and Coleen have always been mindful of the pressure their sons would face and refused to force football upon them.",
      "That is why Kai was allowed to sign for Manchester City aged seven, having admitted he wasn't enjoying himself at United. He ultimately left City when Wayne relocated to America to play for DC United. The teenager would then rejoin United in 2020, although his Old Trafford debut represented a rare chance for their club legend to see his son play.",

      "\"Adults, it's different, you could speak to them, so he just said, 'Oh, dad, there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped.\"",

      "Kai has been raised in the public eye and became a Puma ambassador at 12. Coleen has previously outlined her and Wayne's strategy for raising young footballers and shared how their eldest reacts to being compared with his father.",
      "\"We've never pressured them into even playing football,\" Coleen told the Mirror in September 2024. \"We've always just let them decide what they want to do. My eight-year-old was playing and doing really well but then decided he didn't want to, and that's OK.",

      "The man in the dugout has maintained: \"It doesn't affect the team. I fully respect the supporters. They're incredible. They have been for so long and had a lot of ups and some downs as well, but, you know, I'm not offended by it or anything, and the players certainly aren't.

      "However, as The Mirror revealed, United won't be pursuing the England international, instead focusing on landing a world-class defensive midfielder. The club already snapped up Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha last summer so they're well-covered in attacking midfield positions.",
      "Yet there was a period when Palmer nearly put pen to paper with United. Speaking on the Talk of the Devils podcast last year, academy coach Colin Little disclosed what he understood about a potential Palmer transfer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"I know Cole Palmer's family quite well, I know his dad and his uncle,\" he said in 2025. \"We (Man United) were close to getting Cole Palmer when he was about 16, believe it or not.",
      "\"He was umming and ahhing, and I knew he was a big United fan. He was at that age where you're allowed to leave, 16 is it? They were umming and ahhing, Man City, about it.",
      "\"I think City, in the end, made him a good enough offer, but really he was always a United fan, and it was close, I remember speaking. I think City needed to show him a bit more love and that kind of stuff. We never quite got it over the line, but it would've been nice if we did, wouldn't it?\".",
      "Palmer will be staying put for now(Image: Photo by Franco Romano/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Palmer put pen to paper on a nine-year deal with Chelsea upon his arrival in 2023, meaning he remains contracted to the club until at least 2033. Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has addressed the rumours directly this week.",
      "\"There's no reason for assurance. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere. There's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation. That's where I'm at,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. I've had numerous conversations with him. Our thoughts are on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him.",
      "Cole Palmer was linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: Photo by Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "\"He loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player. You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth. There's no point in having a discussion about it.\"",
      "\"But I've scored away and a few here today, so I'm buzzing. I just try and take each game as it comes and show the Chelsea fans and everyone what I came here to do, and that is just play football.\"",

      "A former Manchester United star recalled his decision to leave Old Trafford(Image: Stu Forster/Getty Images)",
      "Louis Saha has enjoyed considerable success since retiring from football, but his final moments at Manchester United were agonising. Two of the striker's former clubs are poised to meet this weekend, having moved from Fulham to United in January 2004.",
      "The France international made an immediate impact under Sir Alex Ferguson, finding the net seven times in 12 league outings during the remainder of his debut campaign. He bagged 42 goals across 124 appearances throughout his Old Trafford stint, helping secure two Premier League crowns.",
      "Saha also witnessed the club's thrilling Champions League final triumph over Chelsea in 2008. However, the forward was absent from the matchday squad for the Moscow showpiece.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League final left Saha convinced his United career was finished. The French striker had been suspended for the 2006 World Cup final and had once more been denied a place on football's biggest stage.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Speaking about the Champions League final to FourFourTwo in 2019, Saha said: \"It was the worst. I'd worked really hard to come back from injury, and I'd also learned from my mistake at the World Cup.",
      "\"It took me four or five years to realise how painful it was, when I wrote my book, because when I finally tried to explain how it felt, I realised how much damage it did to my confidence. It was after missing that final that I talked to the manager and said, 'I need to leave.'\"",
      "He added: \"It became very religious for me when I missed the Champions League final as well [as the World Cup final]. I thought, 'Why has God given me these platforms to perform, but then taken it away from me?' It was the first time I ever cried about football. I couldn't bear it – I was in pain for two or three weeks.\"",
      "After his Champions League disappointment, Saha completed a switch to Everton that summer. During a three-and-a-half-year spell with the Toffees, he netted 35 times in 115 appearances, including an early strike in Everton's FA Cup final loss to Chelsea in 2009.",
      "Louis Saha was an instant hit after signing for Manchester United in January 2004(Image:  Ben Radford/Getty Images)",
      "Looking back on his Everton transfer, Saha said: \"It was the right move at the right moment for me. I loved Manchester United - I had a lot of injuries but the manager was always there for me. He taught me to be loyal and have respect. Those things remain within me today.\"",
      "Stints at Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland and Lazio followed before Saha hung up his boots in 2013. Since retiring, the 47-year-old has built substantial wealth through his company AxisStars.",
      "He co-founded the enterprise with Katie Hamer and the firm, which enables connections between \"professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners,\" is believed to be associated with more than 500 former athletes. As CEO of AxisStars, Saha has reported a net worth of around £4.3billion.",
      "Saha scored five in 24 games during his final season at Manchester United (Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "A profile of Saha on the AxisStars website states: \"Since hanging up his boots, Louis has moved into the world of business where he has used his experience to develop propositions to support athletes and other people in the public eye, in their careers.\"",
      "Saha enjoyed three-and-a-half seasons at Fulham before his United switch, with his 27 goals helping the west London outfit secure Premier League promotion in 2001. He had found the net 13 times in 21 league outings at the beginning of the 2003/04 season, prompting United to make their move.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford has played with and under Michael Carrick at Manchester United(Image: PA)",
      "Marcus Rashford has been told he could be given a \"clean slate\" at Manchester United following the appointment of Michael Carrick by one of the club's former players. The ex-United midfielder was named as the club's interim head coach until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was sacked.",
      "Carrick, 44, has had an impressive start to his Old Trafford reign with victories over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two matches at the helm. With the January transfer window approaching and Carrick's contract set to expire at the end of the season, it's possible he won't be involved in any player transfers during his short tenure.",
      "This summer is a crucial one for United, who will appoint a permanent manager tasked with deciding the futures of several players currently out on loan, including Rashford. The 28-year-old forward joined Barcelona on a season-long loan last summer and has openly expressed his wish to secure a permanent deal with the Spanish heavyweights.",
      "With Rashford currently due to return to Manchester at the end of the season, club legend Teddy Sheringham stated that past issues with former managers won't affect a potential reunion with his childhood club.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "In an exclusive interview, via Mr Q, the former forward shared his thoughts on whether he'd like to see the club's loaned players return. He stated: \"I think there are a few players like that, Sancho, Rashford, and Hojlund, who are out on loan at the moment.",
      "\"When a new manager takes over, everyone has a clean slate.\" Rashford and Carrick played together at United for three seasons and Sheringham believes that the public doesn't fully understand the relationship between the interim boss and the loaned players.",
      "He elaborated: \"You don't know the situation or what relationship Michael Carrick has with all these players. He might have a way of making them perform. So it's great that they're still attached to Manchester United and that Michael Carrick has that option and has them at his disposal.",
      "Marcus Rashford is on loan at Barcelona(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Get them back in and see where their mindset is. They're obviously good players, so give them another chance if they want it and all is forgiven. That's the way I see it.\" With Carrick's immediate positive impact on the United squad, there's been speculation about whether the club's hierarchy could offer him the permanent job if the good results continue.",
      "Sheringham conceded that the club might opt for an experienced manager, but he feels that Carrick's approach is exactly what United need. The former England striker expressed: \"Listen, they might go down either line, but I like the fact that Michael Carrick is in there.",
      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a stellar start to life with Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"He knows the club, understands the supporters and what they want from a football team. He has the backing of Sir Alex Ferguson and can tap into his experience. I know it's very early days, but I think it's a really good fit.",
      "\"I like his demeanour around the place, and I presume he's strong enough to handle things when they start getting tough. He's been there and done it, and seen it all as a player, so I wish him the best of luck.\"",

      "Michael Carrick wants to bring Marcus Rashford back to Manchester United - if he is named the club’s next permanent manager.",

      "That has already led to speculation that Carrick could be handed the position on a permanent basis at the end of the season. And if that is the case, the Telegraph report that he would like to bring Rashford back into the fold at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford was ostracised by Amorim, who said he would rather play the 63-year-old goalkeeping coach, than the England international. He joined Aston Villa on loan at the end of the 2024/25 season, before making the move to Barcelona for the current campaign.",
      "The La Liga giants have an option to make that deal permanent, with all signs suggesting that they will execute that £26million clause. However, Carrick, who played with Rashford during the final years of his playing career, still sees a place for him at his boyhood club.",

      "Speaking after his midweek goal in the Champions League, Rashford admitted that the style of play under manager Hansi Flick has taken him some time to adapt to.",
      "“I think for the front guys we have to put as much pressure on the ball as possible because the problem is when players have time on the ball to pick the passes and to see what our backline is doing,” he said.",
      "“If they do have time then the backline have to adjust. But it’s our way of playing, it brings an intensity to the game. I think when we play at this intensity it’s difficult for teams to match us.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“For me it takes a little bit of learning to get used to because you can’t let them rest on the ball. Whoever is closest to the ball always has to put pressure. So it’s a little bit different to what I’d done before. But this is the style of defence we play and when it works it’s really good.”",
      "Flick has regularly heaped praise on Rashford and hinted that the final decision over his future will lie with Sporting Director Deco.",
      "He said: \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's Deco's job to do things for next season.",

      "Bennett had been with the Premier League giants since he was 10 and has risen through the ranks, captaining the youth side that claimed the FA Cup in 2022, scoring against Nottingham Forest in the final.",
      "The 22-year-old never made an appearance for the Red Devils senior side and was unlikely to force his way into the first-team picture given the quality that already exists in their ranks.",
      "Bennett said upon completing his move to Fleetwood: “I’ve just turned 22 and I think now is the time to kick on and play as many games as I can. I’ve been out on loan, I’ve played a lot of football, and it’s about getting more experience and growing as a player and as a person.”",
      "Last term Fleetwood, who were initially managed by Charlie Adam, finished 14th in the fourth tier but their style of football was a big draw for Bennett. He said: “The style of football really worked for me. We wanted to play, be comfortable on the ball, and the back five suited me. There are a lot of good players here and that helped me kick on.",

      "In total 7% of United’s 46,800 season ticket holders live outside the UK - from as far afield as Bahrain and Bermuda, New Delhi and New York Outside of the UK the largest number of season ticket holders headng to Old Trafford are in the Republic of Ireland, with 1,616, or 3.5% of the total. Next on the list is Norway, with 837 fans holding tickets.",
      "Third on the list is the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta - which has a population of just 570,000, around 60,000 fewer than the area covered by Manchester council - with 185 season ticket holders.",
      "Patrick Dorgu celebrates scoring at Old Trafford(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "The figures, uncovered by Mancunian Matters, also show Denmark has 95, Switzerland 73, Sweden 62, Iceland, 23, the Netherlands 22, Belgium 20 and Poland (eight).",
      "There are seven season ticket holders living on the other side of the world in Australia while there are 13 in Thailand. Across the Atlantic there are 66 in the USA and 10 in Canada. Countries with a single season ticket holder include Italy, Croatia, India and even Russia.",
      "Joe Tedesco, President of Manchester United Supporters’ Club Malta, the world’s oldest official United supporters’ club, said: “I actually thought Malta would have more than 185 season ticket holders, we used to have around 500. Covid had a big impact; a lot of people gave up their tickets because they couldn’t travel, and afterwards, the prices of the flights to the UK rocketed.”",
      "He told Mancunian Matters: “Now it’s not unusual to have to pay €600 for a return flight. We are also affected a lot by the kick-off time and date changes for TV. This season in particular, we have had a lot of Monday night games. There have been a lot of instances where people have booked flights for the weekend, returning on Monday morning, only to see the game moved to the Monday night.”",
      "There are 209 season tickets, or 0.4%, registered to addresses outside Europe. In the USA the largest number of fans are in New York (12), followed by Illinois (nine), California (seven), Texas (six) and Virginia (six).",
      "It is unlikely that fans from far afield travel to Manchester 19 times each season. All season tickets are digital, and accessed through a phone app. Through this season ticket holders can create “relationships” with official members and forward their ticket on on a game-by-game basis",
      "The club states that all season tickets must be used for 16 out of 19 league games per season.",
      "United has over 330 supporters’ clubs globally, many of which share season tickets between their members depending on who is available to travel.",
      "Thai MUSC is one of the largest Manchester United supporters’ clubs in Asia. Their club chair said: ““Season tickets offer a great seat location and we can easily forward them to whichever of our members can attend the game.",
      "“Myself and our secretary travel to Manchester once or twice a season. Over the past few years it has been harder for our members to travel – each trip costs around £2,000 – and so we have donated the tickets to the Manchester United Foundation when no-one from the club can make the game.”",

      "Scott McTominay has been warned that Manchester United must be his sole destination should he opt to return to the Premier League.",
      "The 28-year-old departed Old Trafford in 2024 after spending 22 years at the club to sign for Napoli in a £25million transfer and has flourished ever since making the switch. McTominay clinched the Serie A championship last year, which brought individual accolades as he secured both the Serie A MVP and Serie A Footballer of the Year awards.",
      "He also received his maiden Ballon d'Or nomination, with his performances in Naples transforming him into a beloved figure amongst supporters in the Italian city. Since his departure from Manchester, he's spoken candidly about his affection for the club he supported as a youngster, though he's settled comfortably in Italy.",
      "Whilst a comeback to his previous club appears improbable in the near future, United should remain the only English side he represents, according to club icon Teddy Sheringham.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "In an exclusive interview, via Mr Q, the former United forward declared it would be a \"travesty\" if United permitted him to represent another Premier League outfit. He said: \"If he comes back to England, then there's no way Manchester United can miss out on him.",
      "\"He simply cannot come back to the Premier League without going to Manchester United. That would be a travesty. That cannot happen.\" When quizzed about whether McTominay could one day make the switch to Liverpool despite his Man United connections, a baffled Sheringham dismissed the possibility outright.",
      "He said: \"McTominay and Liverpool? Really? I don't think that can happen. There's too much friction between Manchester United and Liverpool for him to even consider going there.",
      "Scott McTominay was at Man Utd for 22 years before he departed for Napoli(Image: Getty)",
      "\"If he's coming back to the Premier League, he has to go to Old Trafford, certainly from Manchester United's point of view.\" Sheringham, who lifted the Treble with United during the legendary 1998/99 campaign, was amongst the most vocal critics of McTominay's departure to Napoli, arguing that his former club desperately needs a player with his qualities right now.",
      "He added: \"I'm devastated to see him performing so well somewhere else. They could do with Scott McTominay at Manchester United right this minute. When he left, I wasn't happy. He's one of those players who digs in when things aren't going quite so well and makes things happen.",
      "Teddy Sheringham believes Man Utd should never have sold the Scotland international(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"I think that's exactly what you need when you're struggling. So when he left, I really wasn't happy, and then to see him doing so well just makes it even more of a bad move on Manchester United's part. \"\"But I'm delighted for him on a personal level that he's doing so well in Italy.\"",

      "Harry Maguire is facing a crossroads at Manchester United this summer(Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's Harry Maguire faces a pivotal moment this summer as his contract nears its end. But the situation poses a dilemma for the club where he has been a defensive mainstay for seven years.",
      "Despite experiencing ups and downs in form, Maguire has managed to maintain his reputation in Manchester. Some might argue that despite the scrutiny he has faced since his move from Leicester City in 2019, he has justified his £80million price tag over time.",
      "However, the reality is the player will turn 33 in March and offers little in terms of resale value. The world's most expensive defender extended his contract with United for one year last summer but could now potentially leave on a free transfer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Currently one of United's top earners with a weekly wage of £200,000, Maguire will need to agree to a pay cut if he decides to renew his contract at Old Trafford. His next contract could be the final significant deal of his career, but United currently hold a strong negotiating position.",
      "Currently, only three other United players are understood to earn more than Maguire: captain Bruno Fernandes, the outgoing Casemiro and fellow centre-back Matthijs de Ligt. However, it's undeniable there are significantly more than three players at Old Trafford who hold greater value than the England defender today.",
      "Should Maguire agree to these terms, it's conceivable he could sign a new, shorter-term contract. Much of this will hinge on the player himself and his desire to remain part of the United squad.",
      "In a similar vein to the two-year deal Virgil van Dijk agreed to stay at Liverpool last summer, Maguire could potentially continue further into his mid-thirties as one of the longest-serving United stars among the current group. While he may not have had the same impact as his Anfield counterpart, United at least know what they're getting with Maguire.",
      "Scott McTominay and Maguire could feasibly reunite in Naples(Image: Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
      "One potential move being mooted for Maguire is a summer transfer to Serie A. After all, the Italian adventure has proved highly successful for former team-mate Scott McTominay, who has been outstanding at Napoli since his move in the summer of 2024.",
      "The Athletic has reported representatives in Italy have reached out to Maguire's agent, keeping an eye on the player's situation. The appeal is clear, as it would keep Maguire in one of Europe's top leagues, which is arguably better suited to his style of play.",
      "The Yorkshire-born player has developed a reputation for his composure on the ball, despite occasional dips in confidence over the years. The current Maguire exudes a more capable aura when in possession, a trait crucial for a defender's success in today's Serie A.",
      "His prowess in aerial duels would also be an asset in a league that has shaped the careers of many defenders. Antonio Conte's Napoli have been linked with the player since McTominay's arrival, hinting at a possible reunion in Naples.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "In recent weeks, there have also been strong reports about a potential move to Turkey. It is understood Super Lig clubs have reached out to Maguire's agent, hoping to pique his interest.",
      "Several high-profile English players have joined the Super Lig in recent years, with varying levels of success. Tammy Abraham, Daniel Sturridge, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Dele Alli have all made the journey across the Mediterranean, often landing in Istanbul.",
      "Signing with one of Turkey's top clubs usually offers the added advantage of a clearer path to Champions League football. Clubs like Galatasaray or Fenerbahce regularly participate in Europe's premier competition, providing an extra incentive for a move to the Super Lig.",
      "Maguire could extend his Premier League career beyond Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "While some players may be drawn to experience football abroad towards the end of their careers, this might not be the case for Maguire. Should he wish to remain in England, there will undoubtedly be a number of interested Premier League clubs.",
      "West Ham have been linked with the player on several occasions over the years. It's even believed the Hammers had all but signed a £30m agreement for the player in 2023, only for the deal to fall through.",
      "At the time, it was speculated Maguire would agree to reduce his wages to around £120,000 a week to join West Ham. This gives an indication of how much United could potentially cut the player's salary if he signs an extension, as well as providing a benchmark for what rival clubs might expect to pay should they sign him.",
      "Everton were also linked with the player during the summer of 2023, and the Toffees have a history of signing former United players. Maguire would fit David Moyes' preference for tall, robust centre-backs, and one could envision him fitting into a rotation alongside the likes of Michael Keane and James Tarkowski.",

      "Bruno Fernandes remains Man United's record January signing(Image: Shaun Botterill, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United broke their January transfer record when they signed Bruno Fernandes from Sporting CP in 2020. Following in the footsteps of a young Cristiano Ronaldo, Fernandes arrived at Old Trafford with a ringing endorsement from his Portugal team-mate.",
      "At the time of the deal, United were six points adrift of a Champions League spot, but Fernandes' arrival sparked a turnaround. With eight goals and seven assists in just 14 Premier League games, he propelled United to third place in the table.",
      "The immediate impact from the club's record January signing, who cost up to £67.8million, would not have surprised former United star Ronaldo. Before Fernandes agreed to join United, Ronaldo had tipped the midfielder for a big move.",
      "Speaking about his Portugal team-mate at the time, he said: \"In the national team, you have Bruno Fernandes, who nobody knows why he doesn't leave. A lot of talent.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Upon finalising his move to Old Trafford, Fernandes shared the pivotal role Ronaldo played in sealing the deal. Not only did the seasoned striker speak to Fernandes but he also gave positive feedback about the midfielder to his former teammate and then-United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "\"Yes, I talked about Manchester United with Cristiano,\" Fernandes told United's official website. \"He just said good things about United. He said he started living his dream here and he started being a really good player here. I think he is happy with my transfer.\"",
      "The Portuguese midfielder continued: \"I also talked with Ole and he said he asked Cristiano about me,\" Fernandes explained. \"And he said good things about me, which is good! Cristiano plays with me in the national team and he knows me and for me he's a good person. I want to follow his steps.\"",
      "Fast forward to 2023, Fernandes took over from Harry Maguire as United's skipper. Having previously captained Sporting, a leaked WhatsApp voice message from his time in Portugal revealed the high standards he expects from those around him.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo praised Bruno Fernandes before his move to Manchester United(Image: OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "According to Portuguese outlet Record, Fernandes said: \"Bro, I don't say anything! I honestly, if you want me to tell you, I'd rather not comment on anything. I think very badly of some of the attitude of some players.",
      "\"Actually not a certain attitude, it's an attitude that does not exist. There are players who have no attitude here, bro. They don't want to be here, they don't want to play.",
      "\"They don't want to be here then f*** off, let them say they don't want to play. They spend a year here getting money, and then they f*** off, bro. S*** attitude bro, for f**** sake.\"",
      "Fernandes remains a star player for Manchester United (Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Despite United's recent difficulties, Fernandes' competitive spirit has shone through during his tenure at the club. He has won both the FA Cup and League Cup since joining the Red Devils six years ago.",
      "The former Sporting captain was also part of the United team that heralded Ronaldo's return to the club in 2021. The Portuguese pair played together in 51 matches, winning 26 of them.",

      "Hugill, now 22, has been at the club since signing as a teenager from Sunderland but has been unable to break into the first-team picture. He's had spell away from Old Trafford with the likes of Altrincham, Burton Albion, Wigan and Carlisle, but will now complete a permanent move to Kilmarnock.",
      "United don't intend to let Zirkzee follow him out of the exit door despite there being talk of the Dutchman heading back to Italy, where he initially made his name before joining the Premier League giants in 2024.",
      "He has struggled for goals in that time, which led the club to invest heavily in their frontline, pushing him down the pecking order, and the likes of Juventus have been linked with a move.",
      "Carrick though insists he's ready to have Zirkzee be part of his squad. He said: \"Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group. It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time. That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.\"",
      "Zirkzee has been limited to just four Premier League starts and has only scored twice this term with minutes hard to come by. He saw Rasmus Hojlund leave in the summer and the Dane has since impressed back in Italy with Napoli, but it doesn't look as if Zirkzee will be joining him.",
      "Carrick had been told that, despite being named head coach until the end of the season, he would have to work with the squad he inherited. United's recruitment plans are on hold until the summer but the man in the dugout is not ruling out any just yet with the window closing on Monday night.",

Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with. We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.\"",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is back in contention again for the Reds having been out since the derby with a minor injury. Matthijs de Ligt has not returned to training and remains sidelined.",
      "As does Patrick Dorgu. He picked up an injury in the latter stages of the win against Arsenal and Carrick explained on Friday his injury was more serious than had been anticipated.",
      "Fulham signed Oscar Bobb from City on Friday but it remains to be seen if he will be fit enough to feature against United. Harry Wilson is a man in form for the visitors with the forward having scored three goals in his last four Premier League games.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United’s main focus today defensively will be to avoid conceding free-kicks near the opposition penalty area. Harry Wilson is on one of those runs where everything he touches turns to gold. Or goals, at least. He is clearly Fulham’s most dangerous attacker and United need to starve him of chances to get on the ball and cause any problems.",
      "Just the one change then and no surprise to see Cunha in for the injured Dorgu. I thought Sesko might get a start in this one given it is a different style of game and there is a need to give minutes to players, but Carrick is sticking with a winning formula. Good to see Lacey back on the bench.",

      "Carrick insists Manchester United can be successful with the Glazer family in charge despite thousands of fans preparing to protest against the American family and Sir Jim Ratcliffe this weekend. The 1958 group have organised a protest against the current ownership structure ahead of Sunday's game against Fulham, with faith in Ratcliffe's ability to effect change having ebbed away. Around 6,000 supporters are expected to attend the pre-match protest, which is still going ahead despite Carrick guiding United to back-to-back wins against Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games in charge. The 44-year-old said he had no problem with the planned protests and thanked the fans for the support they had shown him and the team since he arrived at the club.",
      "\"I don't think it connects with the two wins,\" he said of the protest. \"It doesn't affect the team. I fully respect the supporters. They're incredible. They have been for so long and had a lot of ups and some downs as well.\"",

      "Carrick said on Friday this was a bigger test than City or Arsenal and you can see where he is coming from. United’s kryptonite this season has been teams who come to Old Trafford and stick men behind the ball and breaking them down is going to be a challenge. They’ve come up with two very good plans for two big games so far, but if this coaching team can develop a plan that sees United dominate territory and create chances today it will be a major success.",
      "Someone in the press room has just asked whether Cunha could be suspended for his swearing in front of the camera last week, and we just don’t know about it. I think it’s fair to say the Brazilian will be available. He has got away with what happened last week. The FA said earlier in the week they would let us know if there was anything from their side, the radio silence since then suggests they weren’t interested in taking it any further. That is good news for United, as Cunha will be needed to fill in for Dorgu.",
      "United take on Fulham in the Premier League this afternoon. Michael Carrick is looking to win a third successive Premier League game after impressive wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. Carrick has made the perfect start to his interim role, but Fulham will pose a different challenge at Old Trafford, which should provide further clues about the improvements United have made.",
      "Fulham are seventh in the Premier League and have one of the most in-form forwards in the topflight, Harry Wilson, in their ranks. Regarding the team news, Joshua Zirkzee has returned to training this week but Matthijs de Ligt remain sidelined, while Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out after picking up a hamstring injury but the exact length of his absence is unclear.",

      "United interim head coach Michael Carrick will be eager to keep the positive momentum going this weekend when the Reds welcome Fulham to Old Trafford. Carrick's first two matches back in the United dugout could not have gone any better with wins against Manchester City and Arsenal recorded. However, Marco Silva's side pose a different challenge for the Reds. Fulham are expected to play a lot deeper and it will be up to United to try and press the issue during the game. Carrick was asked about whether he needed to adapt his style from the one which worked so well in his first two games.",
      "His response was to stress the need to take each game as it comes and he also emphasised the importance of utilising the full squad at his disposal. That being said, it would take a brave man to change the goalkeeper or the back four this weekend.",

      "Carrick has refused to rule out the possibility of Manchester United signing somebody before the transfer window closes on Monday, after being dealt with a blow with the news that Patrick Dorgu has picked up a hamstring injury. Dorgu had been in fine form for United and started the past two games on the left wing, scoring against Manchester City and Arsenal, but he is now out for a couple of months after picking up the injury at the Emirates.",
      "United have insisted all January that they would only make a move for a player who was a long-term target this month and the chances of that happening were receeding, but Carrick suggested conversations around recruitment were still going on.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "They will also be without Patrick Dorgu, who has picked up a hamstring injury, although Joshua Zirkzee could be fit enough to return to the squad after he was back in training this week. Victory will hand Carrick three wins in a row and match Ruben Amorim's longest winning streak in charge and he isn't worried about the prospect of needing a different approach this weekend.",
      "\"I don’t think we need to make too much of it, we are where we are and the feeling around the squad and the results we have had, the performances we have had and going into the next game, I don’t think the past is too relevant in that respect,\" he said.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Good morning and welcome along to the United matchday blog as the Reds prepare to face Fulham in the Premier League. Carrick confirmed Dorgu would be out for an extended period during his press conference on Friday, which is a blow for both the club and the winger. It also means United will be making at least one change to the side which beat Arsenal last weekend. Cunha will be hoping he is given the nod considering his excellent matchwinner at the Emirates Stadium. A win for United would make it three in a row for the Reds and would increase confidence further as they push for Champions League qualification.",

      "In front of them, Casemiro has started his farewell tour superbly. The Brazilian is looking more and more like the player United initially signed in Erik ten Hag's first transfer window and has provided the Reds with some fond memories for them to cherish once he has left at the end of the season.",

      "Roy Keane and Michael Carrick have been in the headlines",
      "Roy Keane hasn't been afraid to share his thoughts on Michael Carrick - or his wife for that matter. Carrick, 44, was appointed Manchester United interim head coach earlier this month following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "It's been a triumphant start for the former England international who earned stunning victories against Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games in charge. While some have suggested that Carrick's positive and immediate impact on the squad could place him in good stead to earn the permanent job, should the good results continue, Keane hasn't been on that particular bandwagon.",
      "The ex-United captain sensationally claimed after the 3-2 win over Arsenal that he wouldn't give Carrick the permanent job even if he won the last remaining 15 games of the season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not. They need a bigger and better manager. But he has got the opportunity and what a chance for him, and you know what, he's taking it.\"",
      "In spite of his comments pouring doubt on Carrick's ability to be the permanent boss, he's since seemingly reneged on his past remarks and has insisted he wants him to get the job. Speaking on The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast earlier this week, Keane admitted: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him.",
      "\"I hope they give it to him in the summer.\" He did state that while he hopes Carrick is promoted, he believes it'll be the wrong move for the United hierarchy to make. Talking to Gary Neville, Keane added: \"I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "\"Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",
      "Carrick has won his first two games in charge of United(Image: Nigel French/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.\"",
      "It wasn't just Carrick that took the brunt of Keane's comments but his wife, Lisa Roughead, too who was subject of a dig aimed by the Republic of Ireland icon. Lisa was accused of having a \"big mouth\" by the 54-year-old who said: \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "The comments reignited a feud between the pair from 2014 when Keane had aimed his trademark criticism in Carrick's direction. After United suffered a 2-0 defeat to Olympiacos, Carrick conducted an interview which Keane later lambasted on TV.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The pundit said: \"That interview was just like the performance, flat. He should say a bit more, have a bit more urgency, even in the interview.\" Lisa didn't take too kindly to Keane's words as she took to Twitter, now X, and wrote: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "She later showed regret for her post by deleting it and added: \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me.\" Carrick himself has also made his feelings clear on Keane's criticism, insisting that he 'isn't bothered' about what Keane and fellow former United players who have moved into punditry have to say.",
      "\"They're not putting more pressure on me,\" Carrick said ahead of the Manchester derby. \"I don't feel that. There are plenty of opinions around, some positive, some not too much. It's totally irrelevant in terms of what I focus on.",
      "\"There's a lot that can be said, it's the way of the world. I'm not going to pay too much attention to that. For me, the players and staff, we focus on how we're going to succeed.\"",
      "Asked specifically about Keane, Carrick added: \"It didn't bother me.\"",

      "Post-match, Hackney was asked about his future and he made his transfer plans very clear. Queried if he would be moving before the deadline, he said: \"No. I'm really happy.",
      "Hackney scored against Norwich(Image: Getty)",
      "\"The manager [Kim Hellberg] has got me playing the way I enjoy playing, getting the best out of me. So yeah, I'm really enjoying it. This is what I've wanted to do ever since I was a kid: play for Middlesbrough.",
      "\"And where we are in the league at the minute, as long as we just keep going, we feel confident. Winning promotion with Middlesbrough would mean everything to me. I don't know how I'd be, but I know I'd be over the moon. That is the dream.\"",
      "This news will come as a slight blow to Carrick, who has spoken so highly of Hackney in the past. Back in 2024, Carrick sang the midfielder's praises when he was in charge at Middlesbrough.",
      "\"You couldn't ask for much more from Hayden,\" said Carrick two years ago. \"He's grounded, he's humble, he's down to earth and loves to learn. He loves the place and he loves the club as well.",
      "Carrick praised Hackney when he managed the midfield star(Image: PA)",
      "\"To have that, added with the talent he has got, it's the perfect scenario. I think it just shows his consistency really, over a long period of time. It's not easy when you're a younger player, but he's certainly done that.",
      "\"There is a level of talent out there in and around football and sometimes it might not be that different player to player, but levels can be jumped, or not, if your head is not in the right place and you don't go about your business in the right way and treat your profession with respect.",
      "\"Hayden certainly does that. He's been exemplary really since I've been here and I really enjoy working with him. He's desperate for more, desperate to learn, and he's a real credit to his family, to himself and to the club.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has just brought up six years at Manchester United",
      "Michael Carrick was a young coach on the backroom staff at Manchester United when Bruno Fernandes signed for the club in January 2020. Six years on, the then former player and new boy have been reunited as head coach and captain in what is another Old Trafford reset.",
      "Fernandes completed his initial £47million move from Sporting six years ago on Friday and made his debut two days later in a draw with Wolves. Now he is the beating heart of the team and, restored to an attacking midfield role by Carrick, is still proving himself as the club's most important player.",
      "The 31-year-old has 103 goals and 97 assists in 312 games for United, but he came close to leaving last summer when there was interest from the Saudi Pro League. His future is again uncertain heading into this summer.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "But Carrick has no doubt how important Fernandes is at Old Trafford, having seen the immediacy of his impact in January 2020 and the quality he still has now that the 44-year-old has returned as the club's sixth head coach since Fernandes joined.",
      "\"I've seen the impact he had as soon as he got here. I was obviously here, so I've seen it at close quarters,\" said Carrick. \"He had a huge impact straight away in so many ways. You could see the passion and how much he wanted to do well straight away.",
      "\"You've seen the quality and that's carried on all the way through and his consistency really of performances, his level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and physically be able to do it. So credit him for it in that respect.\"",

      "Fernandes has won just two trophies in his six years at United, the Carabao Cup in 2023 and the FA Cup in 2024, and there is no doubt that the quality of his performances deserves more silverware.",
      "He reopened the debate over his future recently, suggesting that United wanted to sell him last summer but lacked the courage to tell him, and that he has a clause in his contract that could see him leave again this year.",
      "Carrick insists the club captain is happy and committed to United at the moment and said any discussion over what comes next will wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to we want to improve as a team,\" said Carrick. \"We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here. He was fantastic when I was here before, so I've got nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "\"That's not to get too far ahead, you know. That's [his future] on the agenda a little bit, but my main agenda is getting through the game on Sunday with Fulham and Bruno's fully committed.",
      "\"There's absolutely no issues at all with that. Things further down the line [will be] addressed towards the end of the season or whatever. But now everything's positive at the moment.\"",

      "Benoit Badiashile and Jorrel Hato were also taken off with Wesley Fofana, Joao Pedro and Marc Cucurella coming on with all three having an impact. The latter duo both scored while Fofana assisted Pedro's goal and the Brazil international set up Enzo Fernandez for a last-minute winner.",
      "Liam Rosenior's substitutions making a difference arrives as a brutal indictment for Garnacho, who was very poor in the first half. The Hammers found significant joy down their right hand-side with Garnacho and Hato struggled against Bowen and Aaron Wan-Bissaka.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE!** Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page**",
      "He said as part of his player ratings: \"Garnacho kept turning the ball over needlessly. The fans got on his back a bit. Had it hard against Aaron Wan-Bissaka down Chelsea's left-hand side. Hooked at half-time. 3.\"",
      "He said: \"I'm very surprised Liam Rosenior hasn't acted. I know it's harsh to substitute a player in the first half, but they have been absolutely torn apart down this side.\"",
      "Garnacho has thus far endured a mixed start to his career in west London following a move £40million move from United. He has played 1,390 minutes across 26 appearances in all competitions with six goals and three assists arriving in that time.",
      "The majority of those direct goal contributions have come from the bench, with the 21-year-old proving he is much better when making a cameo.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick has spoken to the media this afternoon ahead of Sunday's visit from Fulham in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick confirmed Joshua Zirkzee has returned to training at Carrington this week following his short time out with injury. He also refused the notion that Zirkzee was looking to leave Old Trafford before the January transfer window shuts.",
      "However, there was bad news for Patrick Dorgu. Carrick said the injury is more on the serious side than they first thought and that he will be out for a period of time, albeit a timescale has not been set.",
      "When asked about any late January transfer window moves, Carrick refused to rule out but he was calm about the situation and working with the squad he has at his disposal. The interim head coach reiterated the importance of Bruno Fernandes and insisted Mason Mount remains an important member of the team despite his chances being limited since Ruben Amorim left.",
      "Take a look back at everything Carrick said below...",
      "That is the end of our coverage on the MEN blog. Make sure to stay tuned to our website for more build-up to this weekend's game.",
      "Carrick has told Manchester United it would be \"bang out of order\" to show any complacency against Fulham on the back of two stunning wins in his first games in charge. Carrick has guided United to victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, beating the Premier League's top two in successive games to move up to fourth in the table, but the challenge this weekend will be very different.",
      "United have produced perfect game plans to take on City and Arsenal but they will be expected to dominate against the Cottagers at Old Trafford and beating sides below them in the league at home has been a challenge at times this season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Carrick has refused to rule out the possibility of Manchester United signing somebody before the transfer window closes on Monday, after being dealt with a blow with the news that Patrick Dorgu has picked up a hamstring injury. Dorgu had been in fine form for United and started the past two games on the left wing, scoring against Manchester City and Arsenal, but he is now out for a couple of months after picking up the injury at the Emirates.",
      "United have insisted all January that they would only make a move for a player who was a long-term target this month and the chances of that happening were receeding, but Carrick suggested conversations around recruitment were still going on.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is everything from the first part of Carrick's press conference. Those quotes have been tidied up and we shall hear more from Carrick in the second part of his press conference later.",
      "Big fan of Mason, there is so many good things to like about him. His quality to start with, his attitude, personality. That's why we have a squad, certain times, certain games, certain players will play. As we work through the season, that will come to fruition. I like Mason a lot and he is an important player for this team and this club.",
      "I don't think we need to make too much of it, we are where we are. The feeling in the group, around the squad, the results we have had and going into the next game, I don't think the past is too relevant in that respect in terms of what has worked before. I think the boys are in a good place going into the game. It is a tough game, a really tough challenge. Marco has got them into a really good team. All of a sudden Fulham is a different game because we are at home. Taking anything for granted is bang out of order really and it might be the case the flow of the game is the same as the last two. There is no shame in that. We will deal with game in front of us and we will do whatever it takes to come out on top.",
      "I have seen the impact as soon as I got here. I was obviously here so I saw him in close quarters. He had a huge impact straightaway and in so many ways. You could see the passion, you could see how much he wanted to do well. Straightaway you could see the quality and that has carried on all the way through. His consistency of performances and level of performances, his willingness to always put himself out there and being physically capable to do it. There is a lot to credit him for, in that respect. Of course, we all want to win things, we all want to get better and to improve as a team, we want to be successful and that is something we want to work towards together but Bruno has been fantastic since I have been here, he was fantastic when I was here before. Nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "Let's not get too far ahead. We are working towards this game and we are talking about the window now and it is closing in a few days. That is on the agenda a little bit but my main agenda is getting through the game with Fulham on Sunday and Bruno is fully committed. No issues at all with that. Things further down the line will be addressed towards the end of the season. Everything is positive at the moment and there is no reason to be anything otherwise.",
      "Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group. It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time. That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.",
      "I think we are just working through it, never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up. Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes it is out of our control that we have got to deal with. We are calm, I am pretty calm. We have got and we have shown what we are capable of doing as a team. We will have to see what the next few days bring. But we are calm about it.",
      "It is not ideal, of course it is not, we don't want to lose good players from the group. That is part of having a squad and assembling a squad to be able to cover certain things. We have got players who can do that. It is the nature of the beast, unfortunately.",
      "You have got to play with feeling, emotion, excitement. It is something we speak about. The tactical and technical side is one thing but what we have just touched on is totally something else. The boys have been there in training and in games, meetings and everything around the place they have been there in everything we have asked of them, with everything we have asked. Licha has epitomised that with how he has gone about every day and certainly in the games. We are aware about what it has taken to have the couple of weeks we have had. A couple of weeks is a couple of weeks, it is good but it is two weeks. We are definitely aware it is something we need to extend for longer. We need to respect the game, what it takes to win games, how hard it is and how good a team Fulham are. That is definitely at the forefront of our minds.",
      "Consistency is the key to success it is one of the most difficult things to achieve. It takes so much, it takes a level of performance, a level of mentality, intensity and concentration and actually being able to cope emotionally with the ups and downs of what this game brings and moving onto the next. There is so many things that kind of go into it. That is what we are working towards it, we have had a great couple of weeks - two big results. There is big games coming up. It is about keeping the mind in the right place as much as the emotions to go onto the next game just as we have done the previous two.",
      "Josh is back training this week, which is good news. He has been out for a short amount of time, first training with us since we have been here so that is great to have Josh back. Pat unfortunately is going to be out for a period of time. Still working through how long that is going to be. Disappointing because he has had such a big couple of weeks, we weren't sure if it was a little bit of cramp or if it was something more serious, at the moment it is looking a little bit more of a serious note. A few weeks out, how many weeks? We will have to wait and see. It is disappointing for all of us and Pat, he is in such a good place but unfortunately it is part of football and something you have got to work through and get him back as soon as we can.",
      "De Ligt is not training with us yet. Just working through the process of getting him back as soon as we can.",
      "Carrick is here and the press conference is about to begin. Stay tuned for updates...",
      "We are just 15 minutes away from hearing what Carrick has to say ahead of United's clash with Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United will not move for Cole Palmer, the Chelsea and England star, this summer for two key reasons. Firstly, and simply, United bosses know that Palmer, a boyhood supporter of the club, is out of the club's price range this summer. And secondly, an attacking midfielder is not on the club's list of priorities when it comes to strengthening the side.",
      "United invested almost £135million in the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, while also spending big on a new No.9 in Benjamin Sesko. With Amad making rapid progress too, they aren't short of options in attacking positions, and believe other areas need greater attention this off-season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "When Carrick sits down in front of the media this afternoon, there is a number of topics which could come up. Here's what we expect him to discuss in 45 minutes:",
      "We are just one hour away from the start of Carrick's press conference! Carrick will be sitting down at 1:15pm with his quotes embargoed until 1:30pm. Once the embargo lifts, we will have everything the interim boss has to say.",
      "If Michael Carrick wants to take the Manchester United job permanently, he has got off to the best possible start winning over the hearts and minds of everyone at Old Trafford. Thanks to his success as a player, the fans were already willing to give the former midfielder a fair go. The boardroom and the existing players were always going to be the ones he would find it more difficult to convince. While Ineos chose to put their faith in Carrick until the end of the season, there is a sense the appointment was made to give them more time to sort a long-term plan.",
      "Had Ruben Amorim left at the start of the summer, it would have been surprising if Carrick was anywhere near the conversation to replace him. Therefore, the 44-year-old needed to convince Ineos he is more than just a caretaker keeping things ticking over - should he want the job permanently.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal. It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United bosses are yet to decide on what to do about Harry Maguire - with club chiefs understood to be split over the future of the veteran centre-back. Maguire, now 32, will become a free agent in June, and has not been offered a contract extension to remain at Old Trafford. He is allowed to open talks with other clubs - and his representatives from 'Triple S Management' have been in dialogue with some from across Europe..",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal. Instead, he believes young duo Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can develop into a long-term partnership, while United also have Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on - a duo still in the mid 20s but whom boast a wealth of experience.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Good morning and welcome along to the United press conference blog! The Reds welcome Fulham to Old Trafford this weekend with spirits high after brilliant wins over City and Arsenal. Carrick is likely to be in a good mood but only if the news surrounding Dorgu's injury is good. The Dane limped off during the defeat to the Gunners and while Carrick suggested it was cramp, reports claim the winger could be out for ten weeks with a hamstring complaint. United fans are also set to protest against the ownership before the game and Carrick could well be asked about this in his press conference.",

      "What the new 100,000 seater Old Trafford could look like.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "A report analysing stadium rights has calculated that Manchester United could bank around £150million with a 10-year agreement to sell the naming rights to a new Old Trafford.",
      "Last year, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London, and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the project could be completed by 2030/2031.",
      "Estimated costs for a 100,000-seater designed by Foster + Partners have been put at £2billion. There is an acceptance that United would sell the naming rights to raise revenue, and a new report has calculated the club could bank around £150m with a lucrative 10-year agreement.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The Sponsor have compiled a European stadium naming fair market value report, which outlines United could bank around £15m per season, equating to £150m over 10 years.",
      "The report states if United maintain their current profile and increase their global exposure through regular Champions League qualification, the long-term value could exceed that figure.",
      "It's understood the lofty valuation reflects the scale of the Old Trafford redevelopment, projected capacity, modern infrastructure, United’s global fanbase, and the international reach of the Premier League.",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO, admitted that United could sell naming rights when he spoke at the unveiling of plans for a new stadium. \"At this stage, all the options are open,\" said Berrada. \"We're not closing any doors, so we obviously want the stadium to give us additional revenues for us to be able to invest into the team, and I think that's going to help.",
      "\"One of the biggest upsides is to give the best experience to our fans, to be able to accommodate more fans into the stadium. But it is true that the additional revenues will help finance the talent that the fans will see on the pitch.\"",
      "The Old Trafford regeneration mayoral development corporation, responsible for overseeing the regeneration of the surrounding area, met for the first time at the Imperial War Museum North last week, but the design plans for a new Old Trafford have been put on hold for now.",
      "The rail yard surrounding Old Trafford is owned by Freightliner. The land is crucial to plans for a 100,000-seater stadium, and there has been an ongoing standoff regarding its value.",
      "Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, previously suggested that compulsory purchase powers could be used to acquire the space if a deal could not be agreed with United. In October, United told the fans' forum they were optimistic of agreeing on a deal for the land.",

      "Manchester United's players soak up the applauds after victory over Arsenal(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Sunday afternoon was always going to be a tough ask for Manchester United and Michael Carrick in particular. Expectations were through the roof after the manner in which the Reds beat Manchester City the weekend prior and there was now belief this United team could turn up to the Emirates Stadium and win.",
      "That was despite Arsenal's ground becoming a fortress this season and the Gunners having not tasted defeat since the beginning of December. So with expectations skyrocketing and an opponent seemingly running away with the Premier League title, what were the chances of Carrick being able to mastermind another sensational victory?",
      "It turned out, those expectations were not to be feared. United were sensational in north London and became only the second team to beat Mikel Arteta's side when they have scored two or more goals. The other team to do that? Well, that was also United led by Carrick in 2021.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But it was more than just omens and good fortune which saw United defy the odds and beat the leaders on Sunday. MEN Sport has taken a look at seven things United did tactically which proved to be the undoing of Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "The connotations surrounding 'Park the Bus' are often negative due to some of the football we see from clubs who sit back. What we see from Carrick's system is how deep he likes his team to sit and invite pressure.",
      "On several occasions against the Gunners, you could see Amad and Patrick Dorgu drop into the defensive line, creating effectively a back six which Arsenal struggled to break down. United smothered the defence when the home side ventured into their half which made it impossible for the Gunners to play through the lines.",
      "Once United regained possession, Amad and Dorgu burst out of their holding roles to join the attack. Just as it was against City, the Reds were happy to not have the ball.",
      "Before the game, we all knew where United could be outdone - set pieces. The Reds are no strangers to scoring from corners and free kicks this season but it is Arsenal who have managed to perfect the craft.",
      "The Gunners tried a number of routines to unpick the Reds with only one working, (we will get onto that). But one tactical decision Carrick employed to counteract the Arsenal threat, was to give Harry Maguire a free role defensively.",
      "As Maguire is easily United's strongest header of the ball, it made sense to have him focused on watching its flight rather than being bogged down in a tussle with one of Arsenal's strapping centre halves. Speaking of which.",
      "United were caught out by one set piece in the game and were punished but, for the most part, they defended them well. Arsenal's tactic was to pile their aerial threats around Senne Lammens to cause chaos.",
      "When they attempted that, United's rebuttal was to try and do everything in their power to leave Lammens free so he could punch clear. The one time United were not able to stop the opposition, they conceded.",
      "Fortunately for the Reds, they were willing to embrace the battle and the scrappier side of the match. They played Arsenal at their own game and were victorious.",
      "Harry Maguire and Gabriel exchange a war of words during Manchester United's victory over Arsenal",
      "It was not that long ago Jamie Carragher was on Monday Night Football expressing how Casemiro's legs had gone and football had left him. Sunday was yet more proof this long goodbye could be a brilliant swansong for the Brazilian.",
      "On paper, you would think Kobbie Mainoo was most likely to be the box-to-box midfielder in the United system but in reality, it was Casemiro pushing up towards the No.10 position when pressing and then dropping deep when Arsenal were on the front foot.",
      "When United were in possession and on the attack, Casemiro did well to shuttle play out onto the flanks from an advanced role. The Brazilian's passing range is underrated but few would have predicted him being capable of playing such a physically demanding position so well - but he did.",
      "What we saw too often last season was United's centre-forward - usually Rasmus Hojlund - struggling at the top of the pitch trying to perform the pressing duty solo. There are few players in the modern game who can do that for the entirety of a match.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is much more mobile and willing to do the unseen work but even he cannot do it for a full 90 minutes. The Cameroonian shared this responsibility with Amad and this allowed the forward to recharge his batteries so that when the time came, he was ready.",
      "The first goal proved United were more than just a team willing to sit back. When Gabriel received the ball, he was met with a wall of players in front of him.",
      "United were helped by Martin Odegaard not dropping back to support the defender but the initiative of Casemiro and Mainoo to step up and ensure the attack and midfield pressed as one was impressive. By the time Martin Zubimendi played the loose ball straight into Mbeumo's path, there was little more he could have done to avoid that outcome. It was a masterclass in pressing from the Reds.",
      "In the first half, Lammens overshot a long ball upfield towards Mbeumo and the Arsenal defence easily mopped up possession. Instead of lambasting his goalkeeper, the Cameroonian could be seen showing appreciation for the idea and it became clear why.",
      "With the score locked at 2-2, Lammens went long again and this time reached his target of Benjamin Sesko. Other than Matheus Cunha, Sesko played the biggest role in the winner.",
      "His strength and ability to knock the ball down for Fernandes opened the Arsenal defence up. It still required a moment of genius from Cunha but without having the focal point at the top of the pitch, United would not have scored a third.",

      "Since taking charge at Old Trafford, Carrick has overseen wins in both games against Manchester City and Arsenal.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates Matheus Cunha's goal with his coaching staff",
      "It was half an hour until midnight when the Manchester United coaches carrying players and staff arrived back at Carrington on Sunday. The ecstasy of their win at the Emirates was beginning to wear off, and another long week was stretching out in front of them.",
      "Michael Carrick and his staff had spent the journey home poring over footage from the game and preparing for the week ahead. Although the players have Monday off, the coaching staff were in, finalising session plans ahead of the weekend's game with Fulham. At 1pm, they strolled over to watch the Under-21s take on Brighton in the Premier League 2 at Carrington.",
      "That is the third academy game since Carrick took over and the third he has attended. The diligence of the 44-year-old and his staff has been noted around the building. Two weeks ago, the mood at Old Trafford was one of despondency. When United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton, the picture had become clear. There were 17 Premier League games remaining, and that was it. Another season of drift looked set for a long, drawn-out conclusion.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "There was no anger towards Darren Fletcher after that FA Cup exit. The Scot had been a safe pair of hands for a week after the chaos of Ruben Amorim's exit, but it felt like nobody was enjoying themselves any more. Not the players, and definitely not the supporters.",
      "Contrast that with the scenes in the away end at the Emirates on Sunday. Fifteen minutes after the final whistle had blown, there were United fans still there, slowly drifting towards the exit and the North London night. \"It's Carrick, you know...\" could be heard echoing back up into the stands.",
      "Inside the bowels of the stadium, Carrick was just about to speak to Norwegian broadcaster Viaplay when he was pulled away for a meeting with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It wasn't a job offer yet, but if this carries on, one might not be too far away.",
      "Although you could argue this is just a continuation of his three-game spell as caretaker in November 2021. To the wins against Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and a draw against Thomas Tuchel, he has added a victory against Pep Guardiola and another success against Arteta. It is shaping up as a seriously impressive coaching CV at the highest level.",
      "United got the Carrick era off to a winning start against Manchester City",
      "Carrick has been unflappable since taking the reins from Fletcher. He is unobtrusive, low-key and has his feet planted so firmly on the floor that it's a surprise it isn't a challenge to lift them when he needs to move. He showed little emotion on the touchline on Sunday, only coming to life in front of the away end at full-time, with his two children among the 3,000 or so away supporters.",
      "It might have felt strange for them to be singing a song in their dad's honour, but then they might have been the only ones not doing so. Carrick has eschewed grand statements since his return. There has been no mention of chats with Sir Alex Ferguson, no real mention of his playing days or past glories. When it was put to him that United could do with a midfielder like Carrick now, he was self-effacing and made fun of himself.",
      "There has been no schmaltz or nostalgia since his return. This hasn't been a renaissance built on someone talking about the United DNA, but on someone delivering the United DNA. Two very different performances have produced the same result.",
      "This is a triumph of substance over style. It's been built on the training ground as much as Carrick is taking the plaudits now, he knows the work of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion is essential to what they have delivered in the space of two weeks.",
      "For 14 months, Ruben Amorim wanted more time on the training pitches, but when he got what he wished for, he made little use of it. Whether the blame for that lies with Amorim or his experienced backroom team, it's clear that this thrown-together coaching set-up under Carrick is maximising the time they have.",
      "They had three sessions to prepare for Manchester City and delivered a game plan to dominate the derby and play front-foot, counter-attacking football. They then had a full week to come up with a strategy for the trip to Arsenal and delivered an approach that blocked space and offered the hosts nothing from open play.",
      "You can see the players have brought into it. Holland deserves plenty of plaudits as well. He is the most experienced member of the coaching staff and the Mancunian has quickly won the respect of the squad.",
      "The challenge for Carrick and co will change now. They have delivered tactical successes in games in which they were outsiders, but against Fulham on Sunday, United will have the ball and need to dictate the game. That will call for a change of focus this week.",
      "Cunha celebrates his dramatic late winner against Arsenal",
      "Carrick said after the win at the Emirates that there were \"layers\" still to add to the game plan and things to improve. Some of that will be related to breaking down a low block. United's kryptonite recently has been beating teams at home that they should be beating.",
      "If they do that and do it with style, then the clamour for Carrick will only grow. The man himself is refusing to say whether he even wants the job.",
      "\"I am here to do a job,\" he said on Sunday \"When I came here less than two weeks ago, I said we would make every decision for the bigger picture.",
      "\"We are not getting carried away. It is two huge results, but we will keep our feet on the ground. I am enjoying it and I will continue to do what I can.\"",
      "That has been more than good enough so far, but a different kind of test awaits this week.",

      "Ratcliffe attended the game with Omar Berrada, United CEO, and Jason Wilcox, United football director. After full-time, the Ineos entourage was spotted making its way to the dressing room area within the Emirates. Lammens was asked whether Ratcliffe had popped into the dressing room to speak to the players, and he responded: \"No, I just saw him there when we came out of the dressing room.",

      "\"So today we did that, I think just hardworking, defending together, and then at the end, the subs like Cunha made a difference, and also, the people who come in give our team energy.\"",
      "Lammens claims the ball at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Michael Carrick has overseen wins over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games since his appointment as head coach, and Lammens put the team's improvement down to going back to basics.",
      "\"To be honest, there's not many special things he did. It's just like sticking to the basics,\" said Lammens. \"Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then the quality of us comes out, and I think we have players with the quality that can make the difference.",
      "\"But if you just do the basics right technically, we're standing right, defending good together. And just [playing] as a team, to be honest, he made it really clear what he wants from us and what he expects from us.",
      "\"And I think today as well, on the pitch sometimes it [the plan] didn't really come out, but if you fight as a team and if you keep believing in it, then you can still get the win.\"",
      "When asked about Carrick's post-match message to the players, Lammens said: \"To be honest, the same things. It wasn't the prettiest game, but those were the most difficult ones. Last week was, I think, in every aspect, a good game. I think we play really well. Today was not always perfect.",
      "\"But like I said before, if you work hard as a team, you can always win. And now it's up to us. We're there, top four, to stay there and to even look above us. Those games against those top teams, you have to win.",

Arsenal equalised through Mikel Merino, but there was another twist in the tale when Matheus Cunha came off the bench to make it 3-2 with a superb shot from the edge of the box.",
      "Michael Carrick has started his interim gig with wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. United have moved to fourth in the table, which means they are now in a promising position to qualify for the Champions League. Here are the moments you might have missed...",

      "Dorgu shocked himself",
      "Dorgu scored one of the finest goals of the season and didn't know what to do with himself as he celebrated. The 21-year-old was just as stunned as everyone in the crowd at his strike.",
      "There were limbs in the away end as Dorgu made his way over to the corner. Once he'd been mobbed by his teammates, Dorgu shook his head at the TV camera, as if he was thinking, 'how did I do that?'",
      "The Dane has gone from strength to strength over the last few weeks and his confidence is flowing. He had the audacity to take a swing from the edge of the box, and the execution was perfect. Arsenal goalkeeper Raya had no chance as the ball kissed the crossbar on its way into the net.",
      "Carrick made a bold decision to start Dorgu in the Manchester derby and he vindicated that selection by scoring. Dorgu would have felt 10ft tall in training this week, and he probably wouldn't have attempted the shot without that belief.",
      "The importance of corners",
      "Before facing United, Arsenal had scored 24 goals from set pieces in all competitions this season - the most by any team in Europe's top five leagues. They have earned a reputation as being deadly from set-plays during Arteta's tenure, and it was clear that United had been prepared for that threat.",
      "Casemiro cleared the first Arsenal corner of the game, winning the header amongst a scrum of bodies, and Maguire reacted by enthusiastically applauding him as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Every corner felt like an event, and there was a sense of anticaption around the ground when United conceded a set-play. The players fed off that energy, and Dalot whipped up his teammates as United prepared for Arsenal's second corner of the match, which was successfully cleared.",
      "Carrick prepared his side in training to deal with set-pieces. United conceded from two corners at the Emirates in December 2024, and work had been done to ensure they would not suffer the same fate.",
      "However, it's still difficult to stop Arsenal from corners, even when you prepare to face their threat. They piled bodies into the box, and Senne Lammens was crowded when Merino scored to make it 2-2.",
      "Casemiro appreciation",
      "Casemiro turned to the bench and first pumped when Mbeumo equalised in the 34th minute. United celebrated in the corner, and Casemiro briefly considered saving his legs before deciding to join in.",
      "It was announced earlier in the week that he will leave United upon the expiry of his contract. The Brazilian is hugely popular with matchgoers and was serenaded by the away section.",
      "United are set to sign a replacement for Casemiro in the summer transfer window, and it will be a good sign if his successor becomes half as popular with fans.",
      "Mbeumo's trademark",
      "Mbeumo scored his ninth goal of the season to fire United back into the game, and he used the same celebration as he did against Liverpool at Anfield, outstretching his arms.",
      "He used the same celebration when he scored against Tottenham in November, and it feels like it's becoming Mbeumo's trademark to wheel it out when he scores against 'big' clubs.",
      "It must be irritating for opposition fans to see Mbeumo celebrating in front of them like that. The 26-year-old has been a brilliant signing and possesses the kind of confidence that you need to represent United.",

      "Luke Shaw received tactical instructions from Carrick while United celebrated their equaliser. Carrick moved his hands while he was locked in conversation, and he appeared to ask to move the ball quicker.",
      "Some managers may have got carried away in the euphoria of the goal on the touchline, but Carrick remained composed and used the time to pass on instructions after spotting something that could be improved.",
      "Remarkably, Carrick did not even show emotion when Cunha scored to make it 3-2. Instead, he began a dialogue with his backroom staff. There was finally a release of emotion from the 44-year-old at full-time.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates United's win at the Emirates",
      "Michael Carrick told his Manchester United players to keep their feet on the ground and stay humble after they backed up a derby day win by beating Premier League leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, with Matheus Cunha's late winner securing a stunning victory.",
      "United have beaten the Premier League's top two in Carrick's first two games in charge and now sit fourth with 15 games of the season to go. That puts Champions League qualification well within their grasp, but the 44-year-old is refusing to get carried away.",
      "Carrick has had an immediate impact since replacing Ruben Amorim, and these wins have sent out a statement about their intentions this season after a disappointing run of results in December, but one of the former United midfielder's strengths has been a calm demeanour, and he isn't about to misplace that now.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Although the away end revelled in a victory that hurt Arsenal's title chances, Carrick was focusing on the impact he could have within the club, rather than the statement it can send out to the rest of the league, and he is determined to make sure his players do not get carried away.",
      "\"I think it's more about the feeling that gives us as a group,\" he said. \"And the players and certainly the supporters, you know? That's my concern, how that can bring us together and lift us in a real positive manner.",
      "\"I'm not getting carried away. We've got some bigger games coming up, because every next game's the bigger game. So we're not getting carried away, we've got really important things coming up that we need to kind of keep improving with.",
      "\"Two massive games. There's a lot of emotion and a lot of energy and a lot of confidence that you can take from that, but be humble and understand how we've got these results, that's really important moving forward.\"",
      "United fans were chanting 'we're gonna win the league' as they left the Emirates but Carrick didn't flinch when told that in his post-match press conference, instead returning to a theme of focusing on Fulham next week rather than getting sucked into looking at the bigger picture.",
      "\"I know from our perspective it's just moving forward to the next game,\" he said. \"It's been less than two weeks that we've been together, so it's just keep getting good habits really, and good routines. The boys have been fantastic with that.",
      "\"I don't think we can look too far ahead. We certainly won't be anyway. We'll finish where we finish by the results we get. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really so we've taken this week by week and game by game.",
      "\"We'll certainly continue to do that, but we've got to ride it. You've got to use the emotion, you've got to use the energy, you've got to use the confidence, but be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results and it doesn't just come easy. So we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

It was criminal that Slot dropped him as soon as Isak was fit; that decision also coincided with our horrendous down turn in form but I suspect that correlation rather than causation. If he were to do so again then I think fans would riot. Hugo has earned that spot right now and it should be his to keep; everyone else in this team needs to find a place around him in my opinion.",
      "The Mo drop off is so sad to watch and so hard to understand. He was through and clear on goal and forgot to curve his run to bring him closer to goal. In the end Trippier just took it off him. Is he fully devoid of confidence or just downing tools until Slot is gone? His lack of output combined with Gakpo is probably why we have struggled so much this season. Today Gakpo had these flashes driving into space but then had zero output or clue of what to do every time. He seems so out of sync with the team; once he raced into the box and then to the byline and crossed it at chest level for a defender to clear when he could’ve rolled it on the floor two touches earlier into feet for a finish.",

That first Liverpool assist & goal was a thing of beauty. I was badly wrong about Ekitike when I said he’d only ever be as good as Nunez, and right about Wirtz that he might well struggle with the physicality of the PL this season. But!

      "Here, thanks to football analysis experts Gradient Sports, we present the best shotstoppers in the Premier League.",
      "Across a vast range of metrics, Gradient grades every player out of 100, measuring execution and outcome to offer the most insightful and accurate view of individual performance.",
      "This is especially useful when it comes to judging keepers, rather than assessing them on clean sheets or simple shots-saved percentage.",
      "So, according to the grades, here are the Premier League stoppers (who have started a minimum of five matches) ranked for their shot-stopping prowess…",
      "The Argentina keeper has had a somewhat erratic season so far but Martinez has still saved 75% of the shots on target he has faced – better than any other Premier League regular.",
      "Dubravka was an inspired summer signing and without him, Burnley would be further adrift. The 37-year-old has been the busiest keeper, facing 32 shots on target more than anyone else.",
      "Much to the disgust of James Trafford, Pep Guardiola changed tack completely and brought in a big guy to guard his goal. Donnarumma has the lowest saveable goals conceded with 15.8%.",
      "The giant Georgian just scrapes in having played five games when Alisson was injured and Liverpool were caving in after a flying start. Apparently, half of the 10 goals Mamardashvili conceded were saveable, but he performed above expectation on a third of the shots he saved.",
      "Areola has come under criticism having initially been dropped to the bench at the start of the season but there are signs he is starting to recover some reliability during the Hammers’ recent upturn in form. Which won’t be a coincidence.",
      "Dispatched back to the bench recently, which seems harsh, according to the numbers. Maybe Spurs’ bench is comfier.",
      "Raya has faced 52 shots on target, at least a dozen fewer than any other regular No.1, considerably fewer than any other keeper, but the fact the Spaniard is fifth for shots saved above expectation indicates he has been a reliable presence when called upon.",
      "A very mixed season for Sels after sharing the Golden Glove last term. Sean Dyche toyed with replacing the Belgian but Big John blew it.",
      "You can’t blame Vicario for looking unsettled behind that Spurs side but he has been caught up in the chaos too often, even if the stats suggest he remains one the Premier League’s better shotstoppers.",
      "The numbers suggest Pickford has been something of a contradiction. He has made the third-highest number of big saves and is fifth for shots on target saved, but he has conceded the second-highest number of saveable goals (14). Still England’s No.1.",
      "The Netherlands No.1 continues to catch eyes, with Bayern Munich and Tottenham both credited with an interest in the Seagulls stopper. Scrapes into the Premier League power rankings top 30.",
      "A very middle-of-the-road season so far from Henderson, who needed his best yet if he hoped to dislodge Pickford in the England goal in time for the World Cup. May get plenty of opportunities to impress before then since Palace have sold their captain and best defender.",
      "MORE PREM RANKINGS: Best passers under pressure | Most tackle-proof players",
      "May have felt aggrieved to give up the gloves when Lucas Perri returned but Darlow is rightfully back in the Leeds goal. Not because he’s demonstrably better, rather he’s certainly no worse.",
      "There have been occasions this season when Leno was less than his usual reliable self, evidenced by the fact that no keeper has conceded more saveable goals (16).",
      "Anything less chaotic than Andre Onana was always going to make a huge difference to United and Lammens has been a calming, reliable presence. A top-class keeper? We’ll see…",
      "The Brentford stopper was conceding too many goals that perhaps he shouldn’t at the start of the season while settling into his first job as a No.1, but Kelleher looks more at ease in the role now.",
      "Petrovic, like Bournemouth collectively, began the season well but had a major wobble at the back end of the 2025.",
      "Performed slightly better than Pope but not enough to make Eddie Howe consider a permanent change.",
      "Hasn’t been consistent enough to silence the doubters, and the fact Liam Rosenior admits he is asking Sanchez to do things that may be unfamiliar with suggests Chelsea will be looking for a new keeper in the summer. There’s a good one going free in Italy.",
      "Below Ramsdale for shotstopping here, but many Newcastle fans were happy to see Pope return upon return from injury.",
      "Don’t shoot the messenger, Sunderland fans. We agree, Roefs has been superb.",
      "Alisson is usually a rock-solid presence for Liverpool but the Brazilian, not long ago viewed by many as the world’s best, has struggled to stop the Reds’ rot. Is it time to give Mamardashvili a longer run?",
      "Initially taken out of the firing line because of injury, then dropped after a series of soft goals culminating in the latest-ever Premier League winner.",
      "Dropped, then restored to the Wolves XI, though these numbers would query Rob Edwards’ logic."

      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has made a new ‘transfer decision’ amid interest from European and Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "Fernandes has consistently been Man Utd’s best performer in recent years as he is arguably their sole world-class player.",
      "United‘s captain has carried the broken club on his back during their recent dark times, but it has been widely reported that he could be on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Last summer, it was reported that Man Utd were looking to cash in on Fernandes to fund their rebuild, so a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely.",
      "Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd, but he hinted in a recent interview that he is not completely happy with the board’s treatment of him.",
      "This has fuelled fresh speculation regarding a possible exit from Man Utd, with Saudi Pro League teams and Bayern Munich mooted as potential destinations for the midfielder, who has sparkled in Michael Carrick’s first two games as interim boss.",
      "READ: Ballard, Stach to Man Utd: Ten Premier League newbies poised for pillaging",
      "However, a new report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke claims Fernandes’ latest ‘transfer decision’ is that he has ‘no plans to move to the Saudi Pro League at this stage of his career as he aims to continue playing at the highest level possible’.",
      "“I think he can definitely stay beyond this summer. He’s under contract until 2027, and there’s an option in that deal, as well, to extend it,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“If he was to become available, there’s no doubt that there would be clubs interested in him.",
      "“We know that obviously there has been interest from the Saudi Pro League before, but I’m not sure that Fernandes is ready to move there at this stage of his career. He still wants to play at the highest level.“",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham has admitted that he has concerns about Fernandes, even though it would be a “huge loss” if he moved elsewhere in the summer.",
      "“In terms of Bruno [Fernandes] you’re looking at two different things,” Sheringham told Bet MGM.",
      "“You’re looking at him as captain material and whether he’s an identity which is what the club stands for. I don’t think he’s that because he doesn’t lead by example in his manner on the pitch.",
      "“We’ve seen him throw his arms up in the air and all that which I don’t think is a good look and not something a captain should be doing.",
      "“Don’t get me wrong, the way he’s performed on the pitch over the last couple of years, he’s definitely a type of leader but I’m not sure he’s a captain.",
      "“There’s been a lot of speculation about his future. First of all, you don’t want to lose your top players and without a doubt, Bruno has been one of Manchester United’s top performers over the last two-and-a-half years in a team full of players who have been underperforming.",
      "“I don’t listen too much to speculation but, of course, he’d be a huge loss if he did move on at the end of the season.”",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid ‘want’ Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and it’s claimed that he could replace Jude Bellingham.",
      "If you stop Bruno Fernandes, you go a long way towards stopping Man Utd. But the stats prove how hard it is to subdue the Red Devils captain…",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’."

      "That makes Sterling a free-agent but sees him lose his status as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players.",
      "It also leaves Chelsea without an entry in the top 10, which is dominated by Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "This ranking is based on base salary only – no bonuses included – with most figures sourced from Capology.",
      "",
      "10) Kai Havertz (Arsenal) – £280,000 a week\nArsenal had to give Havertz a little bump up when they signed him from Chelsea, where he was already on a quarter of a million per week. That sweetener adds up to £1.5million a year.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak (Liverpool) – £280,000 a week\nIsak is being paid £14.56m a year, an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player. Which he will have to justify when he’s back from injury.",
      "",
      "8) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest. So it’s especially sickening for the Merseysiders that he may miss the rest of the season.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "5) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money up to this season, but it is now a matter for debate.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. The Brazilian is earning his coin again but only until the summer when there will be no renewal.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. A £2.6million-a-year pay rise was viewed as more than worth it to keep the Egyptian around – and to spare the cost of replacing him – but half a season later, we’re considerably less sure.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "Salah’s future at Liverpool looks set to be determined by whether Slot continues beyond this season amid talk of an Alonso ‘done deal’.",

They’ve lost back-to-back against two teams whose winless Premier League runs extended to double figures before their appointment with the good doctor, and coming minutes away from making that three on the bounce at Burnley.",
      "Meanwhile they’ve been casually winning games in Europe like it’s nothing. In the last three months, Spurs have now won twice as many Champions League games (4) as they have Premier League ones (2).",
      "A team that now, as an apparent point of principle, insists upon conceding at least two stupid and easily preventable goals in every single Premier League match they play has kept more clean sheets in the Champions League than anyone else.",
      "This is Spurs heritage. This is what they do. Spursy has never been purely about the spectacular ability for the disastrous and humiliating; it has always required the ability to occasionally and often entirely inexplicably hit absurd heights to make the pratfalls so much bigger and funnier.",
      "And for many years now, Man City have been a key punching bag along the way in the set-up for whatever nonsense Spurs are building up to. While for the last couple of seasons Spurs have perfected this wonderful new bit of being a clinical force in Europe but worse than ever before domestically, they’ve quite rightly never abandoned the ever-bankable ‘improbable victory over Pep Guardiola’s Man City’ bit.",
      "They’ve won their last two trips to the Etihad 4-0 and 2-0, and also knocked City out of the Carabao last season.",
      "This latest instalment is unfortunately at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Burnley and Brentford remain the only Premier League teams this season to leave empty-handed, but does come with added banter potential from not just Spurs’ own stupid form but the fact last weekend’s results have got City right back on Arsenal’s coat-tails in the title race.",
      "It’s still a bit early in the season for it to become a true repeat of the great 23/24 final-week showpiece, especially with Spurs so uncomfortably close to the bottom three. But it is nevertheless a game that has either a win-win or lose-lose element to it for Spurs, depending on your outlook.",
      "And it gives us the latest chance to wheel out one of our very favourite stats. Since Wolves returned to the top flight in 2018/19, Spurs have taken 18 points from their 15 Premier League games against them. Over that exact time period, Spurs have 23 points from 15 Premier League games against Man City.",
      "Now we know Wolves were quite good for some of that time, but for a lot of that time City were the most relentless collector of Premier League points Our League has ever known. Yet Spurs hold a 7-6 winning record against them over a time period that includes only the very last not-very-good-actually bits of the Pochettino era and all the awful crud that’s followed. And we’ve not even mentioned the infamous Champions League quarter-final.",
      "We have no idea why it keeps happening as often as it does, but we can only assume it will keep happening for as long as Spurs remain so resolutely, utterly and determinedly Spurs.",
      "",
      "Spurs aren’t the only team using the Champions League to mask their domestic failings, with Liverpool managing to even finish above the all-conquering European night Lilywhites after thrashing Qarabag to finish third in the standings and achieve some level of cathartic release after the loss of the most misleading unbeaten run on record with that late defeat at Bournemouth.",
      "And like Spurs, Liverpool now face a tricky game in which to try and port some of that European feel-good vibe to a misfiring Premier League campaign.",
      "They’re not exactly the same, sure. Liverpool are trying to win an undignified scrap for the Champions League placings and Spurs are trying not to get actually relegated, but the point stands.",
      "Newcastle are Saturday night’s opponents for Arne Slot. The lowliest of the English teams in the Champions League having finished all the way down in a perfectly decent 12th, and it’s fair to say that they used up a bit more gas in battling gamely if in the end not that meaningfully to a 1-1 draw against the holders PSG on Wednesday night.",
      "It was a result that left both of them outside the top eight, and burdens Newcastle with another couple of games in a crucial month as they now try to avoid finishing outside the top five in England.",
      "",
      "Unai Emery may be rueing his decision to start Ollie Watkins in a broadly meaningless final game of the Europa League league phase after Villa’s star striker limped off in the first half with what looked like a hamstring issue.",
      "But things would be a sight worse if they hadn’t managed to tie up a deal to bring Tammy Abraham back to Villa Park. It’s a rather neat marker of Villa’s rise that Abraham’s season at Villa Park in 2018/19 involved scoring 25 goals to get them out of the Championship, and he will have rather different targets for the remainder of this campaign.",
      "Watkins’ injury makes Abraham potentially an even more important signing even more quickly for a team whose sheer lack of alternatives goes some way to explaining why Watkins was being used in such a low-wattage game in the first place.",
      "Abraham will now, we assume, be thrust straight into the action and charged with the small matter of instantly providing the goals to keep Aston Villa’s title challenge going. Best of luck, Tammy.",
      "",
      "The wins over City and Arsenal were extraordinary and thrilling. But the reality is that even at their lowest ebbs United have, under all their various failures of post-Fergie managers, quite often managed to summon up sufficient muscle memory to give the teams that used to be their direct rivals a rare old game.",
      "Even under Amorim they would sometimes take points off your Citys or your Arsenals or the Liverpools of this world.",
      "What United have been less good at, particularly in the Ten Hag and Amorim eras, is reliably sorting out the vast glut of decent mid-table teams that you get in your modern Premier League now.",
      "As such, and as dreary yet contrarian as it feels to say it, what we see from Carrick and his side this weekend against Fulham may well tell us more about his and their long-term prospects than the magnificent and attention-grabbing nonsense we’ve had so far.",
      "",
      "Wrexham’s march through the divisions may not yet be done as they launch an improbable bid for the play-offs in the Championship, the division that was supposed to bring Hollywood FC back to reality.",
      "No escape from reality for Sheffield Wednesday, who remain seven points away even from being able to end the season where everyone else began it.",
      "",
      "The European champions are still operating some way short of their brilliant continent-conquering best this season. Having been forced by Newcastle into once again taking the scenic route to Champions League glory they must now protect their fragile advantage atop Ligue 1 on a trip to face Gary O’Neil’s Strasbourg.",
      "And they’ve been in the business of slapping sides silly since O’Neil PFMed his way onto the Ligue 1 scene. Not sides as good as PSG, admittedly, but this looks a slippery test indeed for a team that had to expend a lot of energy for not a lot of end result at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday night.",

      "With all six English teams in this season’s Champions League reaching the knockout stages – and five of the six finishing in the top eight to proceed directly to the last 16 – it now looks certain England will once again receive a bonus spot in next year’s competition.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season are all still involved as we head into the play-offs and last 16. Every other country has by now lost at least one of their teams.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals, all of whom have now started losing teams from their own equations while England power on with a full quota.",
      "With English teams securing five of the eight automatic spots in the last 16 of the Champions League via first, third, fourth, sixth and eighth-place finishes, England have pocketed a huge haul of final-position bonus points to further extend their lead here. Even play-off-bound Newcastle have added plenty more points to the kitty for finishing 12th.",
      "Aston Villa finished second in the Europa League standings for another huge bonus-point boost, with Nottingham Forest safely into the play-offs from 13th. Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. With all nine teams still standing, England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "We only have a year’s worth of data under the current format to go on, but worth noting that third-placed Italy finished with 21.875 last year, which means England are already only about a point away from a total that would have been enough for a top-two finish last time out.",

      "READ: Why big Champions League night containing zero Man United was actually all about Man United",
      "This business enabled Man Utd to invest £230m on signings last summer, and they are well-placed to be in a position to spend even more in this summer’s window as cash will come in via the sales of Rashford and Hojlund, while they could also benefit from Mason Greenwood’s sell-on clause and Champions League qualification.",
      "United’s wage bill will be further boosted by the exit of Casemiro, who is confirmed to be leaving upon the expiry of his contract instead of accepting a pay cut to remain at the club.",
      "And the Red Devils also look to be going this correct route with Harry Maguire, who finds himself in the same boat as Casemiro in terms of contract.",
      "Earlier this week, The Daily Mail reporter Nathan Salt explained why Maguire is ‘increasingly unlikely’ to remain at Man Utd despite Carrick’s admiration of the England international.",
      "“He’s played well in the past two games – winning the man-of-the-match award at Arsenal – but it feels increasingly unlikely,” Salt said.",
      "“United have had ample opportunity to get Maguire on to fresh terms but there appears to be limited willingness at this stage to do so with his contract now around five months from expiry.",
      "“Carrick is a fan of Maguire but senior United figures are keen to see next season’s minutes go to Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, two young players that United believe will be the bedrock of the backline for years to come.”",
      "The Athletic’s Andy Mitten has since added that ‘Maguire’s future will likely boil down to money and the length of the contract being offered’, while he ‘needs to be playing every week and United’s view is that if he’s doing that, the case for a new contract is a much stronger one’.",
      "But the reality is that Maguire is unlikely to retain his current importance for much longer.",
      "Like Carrick, Maguire has benefited from circumstance, returning to fitness and form at a time when Man Utd are on a rare upswing and while Matthijs de Ligt is unavailable.",
      "Maguire has been really good for Man Utd in their last two games, but he is still unlikely to be ahead of De Ligt in the pecking order once Carrick (or his successor) has a fully fit squad, while Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are also there to replace him.",
      "Had Casemiro signed a cut-price extension to remain at Man Utd, his wage would still have been among the highest in the squad and it would have been difficult to justify when he would have been a bit-part player behind Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson next season.",
      "And with INEOS setting a precedent regarding how they will handle ageing players and their expiring contracts, it should be expected that Maguire follows Casemiro out of the door for a new adventure with his head held high.",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes should know better than anyone that the idea Arsenal ‘could be the worst team to win the Premier League’ is nonsense.",
      "The dust having settled from his clash with Lisandro Martinez, Scholes has since decided to take on the entire Arsenal fanbase with a pop at the current league leaders and favourites.",
      "“If you’re thinking of picking a team of the season and picking the front four, nobody from the Arsenal team gets in that,” he said, echoing the sentiments of Jamie Carragher.",
      "“That is not normal, that would never happen. The best team in the league would always have at least one, maybe two players [forwards], in the team of the season,” he added.",
      "May we introduce both Scholes and Carragher to Manchester City in the two seasons prior to Erling Haaland’s arrival, when their top-scoring league forwards were a) Raheem Sterling with ten goals, b) Raheem Sterling with 13 goals, and c) not Harry Kane, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane, Heung-min Son or indeed any forward who would get into the team of the season.",
      "Scholes in particular ought to know that Arsenal, 25 points off the lowest Premier League-winning tally ever set by Manchester United in 1997, with 15 games remaining, would not “be the worst team to win the league” whatsoever. They have five PFA Player of the Year candidates; they’re quite good.",
      "These English top-flight champions who only had a single representative in that season’s PFA Team of the Year certainly contradict Scholes and his ilk.",
      "",
      "Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect that Scholes always keeps his 2002/03 PFA Team of the Year place at the forefront of his mind while engaging in that week’s thoughtful, considered punditry with Nicholas Butt and Patrick McGuiness, but it is also funny that he is so central to the most recent counter to his own argument.",
      "Manchester United won the title in 2002/03 but boasted neither the Player of the Year (Thierry Henry), nor Young Player of the Year (Jermaine Jenas), with Manager of the Year Sir Alex Ferguson and Golden Boot winner Ruud van Nistelrooy proving the difference.",
      "But it was Scholes who carried the Team of the Year flag for Manchester United alone as tap-in merchant Van Nistelrooy was overlooked. He will take solace from finally putting his Henry feud to one side.",
      "Runners-up Arsenal had five players – Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole, Robert Pires, Patrick Vieira and Henry – make the XI, while a couple of stars for third-placed Newcastle in Kieron Dyer and Alan Shearer were voted in.",
      "Manchester United had as many players in there as fourth-placed Chelsea (William Gallas), Blackburn (Brad Friedel) down in sixth and even bloody tenth-placed Spurs.",
      "How can Scholes sit there with a straight face and say Arsenal “could be the worst team to win the league” when champions Manchester United let Stephen Carr into a Team of the Year?!",
      "",
      "The roles had been reversed for Arsenal and Manchester United half a decade prior, when the runners-up claimed a 5-1 win over the title winners in the Team of the Year.",
      "Gary Neville, Gary Pallister, David Beckham, Butt and Ryan Giggs all sat alongside one player each from six different clubs, including Arsenal spokesperson Dennis Bergkamp.",
      "It was the iconic Dutchman‘s best individual season by far in terms of goal return, with 16 scored and 11 assisted in the Premier League alone for the Double winners.",
      "Also sneaking into the XI were Nigel Martyn (Leeds), Colin Hendry (Blackburn), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), David Batty (Newcastle) and Michael Owen (Liverpool), making Bergkamp the sole non-British inclusion.",
      "",
      "It is safe to assume that woke nonsense kept Eric Cantona out of the 1995/96 Team of the Year. Or perhaps a strikeforce of Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, whose respective 25 and 31-goal seasons almost demanded room be made for them.",
      "Beyond the Frenchman it is difficult to see who else might have made it in for the champions. No-one but Cantona scored more than 11 goals, while he also boasted the most assists with ten. Peter Schmeichel definitely had a shout but was pipped by two things: David James of Liverpool; and the normalisation of his own brilliance.",
      "In the end it was only Gary Neville who made the grade at the end of his first full Premier League season, no thanks to Marco Boogers.",
      "Newcastle had three complete bottlers in there (Rob Lee, David Ginola and Ferdinand). Aston Villa filled two spots with Ugo Ehiogu and Alan Wright despite finishing fourth and not having the best defensive record in the division.",
      "Tony Adams (Arsenal), Steve Stone (Nottingham Forest) and Ruud Gullit (Chelsea) rounded out the selection. That has the makings of quite the five-a-side team.",
      "",
      "In an era when one club dominating the Team of the Year was rare, it was commonplace for seven of eight to have representation in the final XI.",
      "Manchester United (Pallister and Mark Hughes) managed to sneak two players into the final First Division selection ever despite finishing as runners-up, with eighth-placed Forest (Des Walker and Stuart Pearce) matching them.",
      "But clubs finishing anywhere from fifth (Manchester City, Tony Coton) and sixth (Liverpool, Ray Houghton) to 14th, 15th and 16th found their way in back in 1992.",
      "Chelsea had Andy Townsend. Spurs had Gary Lineker. Southampton had Alan Shearer. We would all listen to that podcast. And of course Leeds had Gary McAllister, cited as the key inspiration behind their title win.",
      "",
      "It is likely that Liverpool suffered for the European exploits of Nottingham Forest, with Ray Clemence especially unfortunate to miss out to Peter Shilton in the 1978/79 PFA Team of the Year.",
      "Clemence kept 28 clean sheets and conceded an absurd 16 goals in 42 First Division games. Shilton lifted the literal European Cup. Clemence was never out-jumped by Diego Maradona. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "Phil Neal, Graeme Souness and Terry McDermott could make particularly strong cases against their omissions but in the end it was FWA Footballer of the Year Kenny Dalglish who flew the flag alone for Liverpool.",
      "West Brom matched their third-placed finish with three representatives, including two of the Three Degrees in Cyrille Regis and Laurie Cunningham.",
      "",
      "‘I was the manager, the man in charge, who would sink or swim on the success or failure of the players hired. The chairman wouldn’t pay with his job if I failed in mine and it wasn’t his personal money we were spending anyway.",
      "‘Sam Longson was on holiday when I did the deal for what was then regarded as a massive fee of £175,000. I told him nothing about it until I sent a telegram. I can’t recall the exact wording, but it went something like this: ‘Just bought you another great player, Colin Todd. We’re almost bankrupt. Love Brian.’",
      "The inimitable Clough knew he had ‘just signed the best young defender in England, who was about to turn Derby into the best team in the country’.",
      "Todd won the title together with Clough in 1972 before reigning again as Player of the Year – and Team of the Year member – under Dave Mackay three years later.",
      "Liverpool and Newcastle apparently share a ‘toxic rivalry’, but it remains entirely one-sided on the pitch and in the boardroom, to the delight of Arne Slot.",
      "A Tottenham Hotspur signing and two Aston Villa transfers are among six of this January window’s most bizarre deals in the Premier League…",
      "Juventus have not always been the arbiters of morality but their work in environmental sustainability puts their slow, unconvinced Serie A rivals to shame.",
      "Paul Scholes has explained why he thinks Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard is a “problem” for Mikel Arteta and could be “killing” a summer signing.",
      "How closely have you been paying attention to the January transfer window? We’ve got 20 players to suss, starting simple but it gets harder…",
      "When does landing a gig as Kenny Dalglish’s ‘assistant manager’ for a Liverpool Legends game qualify as a ‘return’ worthy of ‘true colours’ being revealed?"

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Friday 30 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",

      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",

      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",

      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Monday 26 January 2026 07:19, UK",
      "Roy Keane says Manchester United have their \"swagger\" back following a 3-2 win against Arsenal but does not agree that Michael Carrick is the right man for the job at Old Trafford.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored a dramatic winner at the Emirates Stadium for United against the Premier League leaders, making it two wins from two for Carrick to kickstart his reign.",
      "Carrick has now overseen victories against Manchester City and Arsenal since he was confirmed as the head coach until the end of the season, but Keane does not agree that he should be a candidate for the role in the long term.",
      "\"If United win every game until the end of the season, I still wouldn't be giving him the job. I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager. The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.",
      "\"Are we going to sit here and believe Michael Carrick can get United winning league titles? It's not enough for me. I don't believe he is the man to get them winning league titles.\"",
      "On the performance against Arsenal, Keane added: \"Considering where they are and where they have been, they had a bit of swagger and calmness to their play.",
      "\"Two brilliant strikes and players off the bench had a big influence. You see the United fans in the corner, it's a bit like the old days.",
      "\"Carrick's done really well. Two brilliant performances. They showed real quality.\"",
      "Gary Neville also believes that Carrick is not the long-term solution for Man United and believes they should target more experienced managers like Thomas Tuchel or Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "\"They played properly, with intensity. I think it's right that Carrick keeps the job until the end of the season and then hands the baton over to a Tuchel or an Ancelotti, someone of that world-class ilk.\"",
      "Despite the strong form in the early days of his reign since being appointed as Ruben Amorim's successor, albeit only until the end of the season, Carrick is not getting carried away.",
      "\"We couldn't expect to come here and suddenly dominate the whole game and the ball. We're just starting off, really. It's a great starting point, but we need to put more layers on top, and we'll try to do that in the coming weeks.",
      "\"I give a lot of credit to the staff and the players for how much they've invested and how much they've bought into it.",
      "\"It's alright trying to help them and say certain things, but they've got to live it - and you've seen that with the boys coming off the bench and making a difference.",
      "\"It's a real collective feeling. It's great when it comes together and everyone's in it, and we can celebrate with the fans at the end. That's important and it's a big moment.\"",
