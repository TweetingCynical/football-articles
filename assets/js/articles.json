      "Ruben Amorim tore into his Manchester United flops in the aftermath of Wednesday night's humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town. The Red Devils crashed out of the Carabao Cup against the League Two side.",
      "They were eventually ousted on penalties after a dismal 2-2 draw. And Amorim made his fury very well known after the full-time whistle, claiming that the performances - or lack thereof - of some of his stars spoke volumes.",
      "\"I think the players spoke really loud today. The best team won. I think it’s really clear what they spoke. Let’s move on from this day. I think it was really clear what happened today.",
      "Asked what went wrong for his side, he added: “I don’t know. Not just the space but the way we start the game without any intensity, any idea of pressure. We were completely lost. They spoke really loud.",
      "\"I think that [the same issues] is a problem. When you lose and see something new, it is different. We have to say sorry to the fans. The support that they gave us with all of the defeats, I just have to say I’m really sorry.",
      "\"I think they [the players] gave the response on the pitch today so I don’t have to talk about that. We have a game at the weekend and then we have two weeks and we will sort things out.\"",
      "Andre Onana endured another woeful evening in Grimsby, but Amorim has refused to lay blame just at the Cameroonian's door. In answering the question, Amorim continued to grow more exasperated and added: \"When you play with respect, a fourth division team, it’s everything. Not just the goalkeeper. It’s every detail. My players spoke for me really loud.\"",
      "The Red Devils will be aiming to finally secure their first win of the season this weekend as they welcome newly-promoted Burnley to Old Trafford.",
      "Elsewhere, Grimsby have been handed a draw against Championship side Sheffield Wednesday as their reward for finding a route past the Red Devils.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "United forward Bryan Mbeumo struck the crossbar with his second spot-kick in an 18-minute shootout to seal the Mariners’ a famous victory after the second-round tie ended 2-2 after 90 minutes at a breathless Blundell Park.",
      "Pym revealed he was a United fan, saying: “It’s not sunk in yet. I’m a Man Utd fan, so I’m half-fuming a little bit. Night’s like this is what you pay football for.",
      "“I should have done a little bit better (in the shoot-out), shouldn’t I? I made one save to keep us in it and the boys have done the rest. It’s brilliant.”",
      "Grimsby goalscorer Charles Vernam, who fired his side into a first-half lead, admitted his nerves almost got the better of him during the shootout.",
      "“It’s an amazing feeling, one that will live with us forever. The message all week has been about belief and knowing how good we are and the gaffer’s instilled that.",
      "“He told us not to just turn up, there’s always a chance if we play the right way with the right intensity. Why can’t it be us? So to pull that off is an amazing feeling and we’re going to enjoy the moment.”",
      "This was the Old Trafford outfit’s first game in the second round of the competition since 2014, when Louis van Gaal’s side were embarrassed 4-0 at League One side MK Dons.",
      "United suffered even greater humiliation on Wednesday at a bouncing Blundell Park, where Charles Vernam scored before Red Devils youth product Tyrell Warren capitalised on goalkeeper Andre Onana’s latest error.",
      "Grimsby had chances to pull further ahead in the second half, only for substitute Mbeumo to pull one back and Harry Maguire ’s latest last-gasp goal to snatch a 2-2 draw and take the match to penalties.",
      "Onana saved new signing Clarke Oduor’s spot-kick and Matheus Cunha blew the chance to win it for the visitors, with the goals continuing until Mbeumo thumped his effort off the crossbar as fans poured onto the pitch. This night will live long in the memory, and leave lasting scars on rebuilding United.",

      "Manchester United fans have demanded the sacking of Ruben Amorim in the aftermath of their humiliating Carabao Cup defeat. The Red Devils crashed out of the competition on Wednesday as they fell to defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Charles Vernam and Tyrell Warren scored first-half strikes, with summer signing Bryan Mbeumo pulling a goal back with 15 minutes to go. Harry Maguire then fired in a late equaliser for Amorim’s side with just minutes to go.",
      "But in the end, United eventually fell to defeat on penalties - Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo the men to miss after a mammoth shootout.",
      "The defeat extended their disappointing start to the new season having failed to win each of their opening two Premier League games against Arsenal and Fulham.",
      "And taking to social media during the defeat, a number of United fans called for Amorim to be removed from his post. One supporter said: “Against Grimsby Town? I hope you’ve prepared Amorim’s sack letter. Useless club.”",
      "Another said: “I would still sack Amorim, gotta be Chelsea like ruthless,\" while another fan responded: “Sack Amorim tonight. Not after 5 games. Not in 3 weeks. Tonight.”",
      "“Everyone knows eventually Ruben Amorim will get sacked, why prolong it,” a further furious Red Devils supporter wrote. “He's clueless this is a stackable offence. If you're truly a big club have some ambition and sack him at this point any interim manager would be better in the short term. This is rock bottom literally!",
      "A final fan added: “I've mentally checked out of Man United. So this score line is not affecting me one bit. Sack Amorim tonight.”",
      "It seems highly unlikely that United will pull the trigger on Amorim any time soon. Red Devils chiefs invested a total of around £9.2m to prise the Portuguese coach away from Sporting Lisbon, while he signed a contract until 2027.",
      "United have also backed Amorim with a lucrative summer transfer window that has seen them spend over £200m - a splurge that includes a major transformation of the club’s frontline.",
      "But they have struggled so far this season having fallen to a slender defeat to Arsenal on the opening weekend. They were then held by Fulham in a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage.",
      "United will certainly hope to secure their first Premier League win of the campaign this coming weekend as they welcome newly-promoted Burnley to Old Trafford.",

      "It isn't even the end of August and Manchester United’s season has already entered crisis point after a humiliating Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby Town.",
      "David Artell’s League Two heroes pulled off a glorious win over Ruben Amorim’s wretched collection of expensive misfits to send Old Trafford into another period of anguished navel-gazing.",
      "It took a crazy, elongated penalty shoot-out in the end but, after being pegged back twice late on in the 90 minutes, Grimsby prevailed 12-11 to send Blundell Park bonkers.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo’s miss on the second time around for the spot-kick takers decided the issue after United had grabbed two goals in the last 15 minutes to take the game to penalties.",
      "Grimsby’s record against Manchester United was good - unbeaten in their last three meetings. The only problem was those were in 1946, 1947 and 1948. The 77 years between dinners only added to the sense of anticipation in North East Lincolnshire.",
      "On a huge night for the port town, Blundell Park - packed to its old school rafters - was jumping. The inflatable Harry Haddocks were everywhere plus a banner announcing with decent chip shop humour that Manchester United were going to get battered.",
      "In the first half they were. Grimsby made a great start, pressuring United into error after error. The visitors did not have a moment on the ball.",
      "Grimsby were making the running and they got their reward when they took the lead in the 22nd minute.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and Amad Diallo collided in midfield, the ball broke to Grimsby and they worked the play to the right where Darragh Burns’ left-footed cross found the unmarked Charles Vernam who controlled it before burying the chance low to Andre Onana’s left.",
      "The United goalkeeper should have done better and so should full-back Tyler Fredricson who ambled across to close down Vernam. Grimsby had the ball in the net again six minutes later after Cam Gardner bundled it in but the goal was chalked off for hand ball by the striker.",
      "The second wasn’t long in coming. As Grimsby worked a short corner routine, Onana flapped at a cross from Vernam, missed it completely and Tyrrell Warren walked the ball into the unguarded net.",
      "It was the former Manchester United youth player’s first goal for the Mariners. Thirty-two minutes played, 2-0 to Grimsby and United were in shock.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, making his first start since his £73.5m move from RB Leipzig, forced Grimsby goalkeeper Christy Pym into two sharp saves, the first low down to his left from a shot, the second to his right from a header after Diogo Dalot had picked him out with a cross.",
      "But that and a couple of efforts from Amad Diallo were all United could manage in a chastening opening period in Cleethorpes. Ruben Amorim’s response was to make a triple change at half time, bringing on Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "United turned up the dial as they had to and Heaven put a free header over the bar from Mbeumo’s free-kick then Pym made a great save from Fernandes’s drive.",
      "Grimsby had another goal from Gardner contentiously disallowed for offside before Mbeumo cut the deficit with 15 minutes remaining. The United substitute cut in from the left and found the corner for his first goal since joining the club in the summer.",
      "Sesko found himself clean through with six minutes left as the ball stuck in a puddle by Cameron McJannet got back to save the day for Grimsby.",
      "United laid siege to the home side’s goal in search of the equaliser and Harry Maguire delivered it in the 89th minute, stooping to head home Mason Mount’s far-post corner. That took it to penalties.",

      "Chelsea are finally set to offer Alejandro Garnacho a Manchester United escape route. Garnacho, 21, has little future at Old Trafford after falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Chelsea have been linked with him all summer and with just a few days of the transfer window to go, the Blues are edging towards a deal. Chelsea are close to an agreement with United that will see them pay between £35-£40m for the Argentine forward.",
      "The Red Devils had initially benchmarked his price against the £50m that Arsenal paid for Noni Madueke earlier this summer. Should the move go through as expected, it will bring an end to a five-year spell at Old Trafford for Garnacho.",
      "He was signed as a teenager from Atletico Madrid in 2020. Garnacho has gone on to make 144 appearances for United in all competitions, scoring on 26 occasions.",
      "He helped United to the Carabao Cup in 2023 and won the FA Cup the following campaign. Chelsea have been conducting checks on Garnacho throughout the summer ahead of their swoop.",
      "They have reportedly been getting information on his character, as well as his approach to work. But they are aware that the proof will be in his performances at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Garnacho’s exit could potentially be the first stage of a clear out ahead of Monday’s deadline. Striker Rasmus Hojlund is also expected to depart, following a tricky couple of seasons in the North West. Napoli are the frontrunners for his services.",
      "Brazilian misfit Antony could also leave over the next couple of days, with Real Betis keen to take him back to Spain. Kobbie Mainoo and Andre Onana also face uncertain futures at Old Trafford, albeit they both started in Wednesday evening’s Carabao Cup clash against Grimsby Town.",
      "Speaking about the midfielder’s future ahead of the game, Amorim said: \"They just need to fight for the places, and then everything can change. Sometimes one is playing, in other moments, other guys are going to play, and we have the cups, so we're going to have a lot of games for everybody.\"",
      "\"We have three games this week, we have quality players, and we need to do rotation to try to win every game,\" the United manager added. \"All the players are available. Then we will make the choice to get the best starting XI to win every game.\"",

      "But the Premier League giants suffered humiliation in the first-half, with their League Two opponents taking a shock 2-0 lead. First, it was Charles Vernam who fired home to open the scoring for the hosts.",
      "Fernandes was stunned at his side conceding and TV cameras spotted him with his head in his hands. Things got worse, though, with Tyrell Warren making the most of a mistake by Andre Onana - who was also given a rare start amid uncertainty over his future - to tap home with just 30 minutes on the clock.",
      "United eventually lost on penalties despite coming back from two goals down. Bryan Mbeumo and Harry Maguire scored to take it to a shootout - but the League Two side eventually won 12-11 after Mbeumo missed.",
      "Manager Amorim is under increasing pressure after a miserable start to his spell at Old Trafford. He has accumulated just 28 points from 29 top-flight fixtures since succeeding Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "United splashed £200million on a new forward line during a summer rebuild but have begun the 2025-26 campaign in inauspicious fashion by picking up a solitary point from their opening two fixtures.",
      "The Red Devils finished 15th last term – their worst Premier League campaign – and club record goalscorer Wayne Rooney recently said Amorim has “no excuses” for underperforming this season and could soon be fighting to save his job.",
      "“There are no excuses now for the manager this season,” the 39-year-old said on his BBC podcast, The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "“He’s got to start getting results and getting results quickly because once you start getting into October, November, if results don’t change drastically then that’s when pressure comes.",
      "“United really needed to hit the ground running this season and one point from six is a worry. It’s only two games into the season but the worrying sign is we’re seeing things that we saw last season and that’s a concern.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived in big-money deals to refresh United’s attacking options.",
      "Yet the 20-time English champions, who lost the Europa League final to Tottenham in May, were beaten 1-0 at home by Arsenal on the opening weekend of the new season before missing a penalty and surrendering a lead in Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Fulham.",
      "Asked if Amorim is the right man for the long term, Rooney replied: “It’s difficult to sit here and say, ‘yeah 100 per cent’ – I don’t think anyone could do that.",

    "body": [
      "Not too long ago Kobbie Mainoo was seen as the jewel of Manchester United’s academy, a midfielder with the poise, vision and technical range that many believed could anchor the club’s midfield for the next decade. But as the summer transfer window nears its close, Mainoo’s Old Trafford future is suddenly in doubt.",
      "Reports suggest the 19-year-old is open to leaving United because he is frustrated by reduced opportunities under Ruben Amorim, who thinks he should only fit in the position occupied by captain Bruno Fernandes. And with contract renewal talks stalling and a host of clubs circling, the coming days could shape not just Mainoo’s career but United’s midfield planning for years ahead.",
      "United are said to value Mainoo between €40 million and €75 million but a season-long loan with an option to buy is emerging as the likeliest path, particularly if United want to retain control over his long-term future.",
      "Here are the leading contenders to land the England star.",
      "Both Madrid giants are monitoring the situation according to reports in Spain. Real Madrid, seeking depth after midfield injuries, view Mainoo as a player who could learn alongside Jude Bellingham and Eduardo Camavinga without the immediate pressure of being a starter - even if his prime frustration at United is around a lack of opportunities. A loan with an option to buy to the Bernabeu would make most sense for all parties.",
      "Atletico Madrid offer a different appeal: Diego Simeone’s side thrives on energy and tactical discipline and it would be fascinating to see him operate alongside fellow England international Conor Gallagher at the Wanda Metropolitano’s engine room with the path to being a guaranteed starter clearer.",
      "Chelsea, never not linked with a talented young player who may be available, have tracked Mainoo for months and remain strongly interested. The characteristics of their rebuild makes Stamford Bridge a logical destination and the club’s willingness to back young players is clear – even though Mainoo would face significant competition for a starting role in Enzo Maresca’s starting XI. With United reluctant to strengthen a direct rival, however, this move would require significant financial leverage.",
      "Thomas Frank needs a tempo-setting midfielder because of James Maddison ’s season-long injury and Dejan Kulusevski’s own issues. And while Joao Palhinha has landed on loan for the campaign, it is easy to see how Mainoo would thrive under a coach like Frank. However the same caveat applies as at Chelsea: United will not want to improve a rival to finish in the top four.",
      "Albion’s reputation for turning young talents into stars makes them an ideal destination for Mainoo to make a major impact and with Brighton not being an expected competitor for a Champions League spot (despite last season’s finishing places) United may be more open to letting him move to the south coast.",
      "Interest is also emerging in Italy. The latest tittle tattle is that Inter Milan and Juventus admire his versatility, while Roma could guarantee more immediate opportunities in a squad keen to embrace youth. Bayern Munich have also been linked, though competition for minutes in Bavaria may be as tough as Old Trafford and that appears a far longer shot.",

      "Some 11 years have passed since Manchester United last played a League Cup second round match, and Ruben Amorim will be hoping to avoid a repeat of what happened that night. Louis van Gaal was in charge when United faced MK Dons in August 2014, and a young Dele Alli impressed as the lower-league side ran out 4-0 winners.",
      "Tonight, Grimsby Town are United's opponents. Amorim has overseen just one match in the competition before - a 4-3 quarter-final defeat against Spurs last season - but the Mariners ought not to worry United's boss despite their unbeaten start in League Two.",
      "“Of course I’m disappointed, but I can analyse this,” Van Gaal said after that defeat in Milton Keynes all those years ago. “I am not shocked because I know what can happen, and I think also that Milton Keynes played very well, very aggressively, and they had also a little bit of luck.”",
      "United's start to the season that year was eerily similar to this year's. They began with a narrow defeat and a 1-1 draw in their first two league games, and took on Burnley on the weekend after their cup exit - the same opponents due to visit Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "One member of the squad in Milton Keynes went on to play their part in helping United bounce back and finish fourth in the league, but others have had a nomadic existence since. Here's what the players from that fateful day are up to now.",
      "De Gea was the only United player who featured in the previous league game and kept his place for the trip south. He didn't let the pain of defeat get to him, either, remaining at Old Trafford until 2023.",
      "The Spanish international left Old Trafford with 415 Premier League appearances to his name, as well as FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League winners' medals. After a year out of the game, he joined Fiorentina in 2024 and helped them reach the Conference League semis last season.",
      "Belgian full-back Vermijl was playing just his second game for United that night, and it would end up being his last. He left for Sheffield Wednesday in the winter transfer window, and would also earn minutes in the EFL with Preston and Scunthorpe.",
      "After a spell in the Dutch second tier with MVV Maastricht, he returned to Belgium in 2020. He spent the last five years with lower-league side Thes, and joined fourth-tier Bocholt over the summer.",
      "The MK Dons match was the beginning of the end for Evans at United... or so we thought. He left for West Brom the following summer before spending five years at Leicester - leaving when the Foxes were relegated in 2023.",
      "Surprisingly, he then returned to Old Trafford for the twilight of his career. He retired in the summer after two more years back at his boyhood club and has now taken on a youth development role with United.",
      "Keane had made his Premier League debut for United just days before the MK Dons game, but wouldn't end up adding to it. He joined Burnley on loan a week later, and that would lead to a permanent move to Turf Moor.",
      "After a fruitful three years with the Clarets, he joined Everton for £25m in the summer of 2017. The centre-back's time on Merseyside has had his ups and downs but he remains part of David Moyes' squad, and scored his one and only senior England goal while on Everton's books.",
      "No, not that one. This Reece James is a left-back, not a right-back, and joined United's academy from Preston in 2012 before making his one and only first team appearance for the club in Milton Keynes.",
      "Now 31, James has spent the last 11 years between the Championship and League One. He's now on the books of Rotherham, more than a decade on from joining them on loan from United a few months after his debut.",
      "Swiss Under-21 international Janko is another who played just once for United's first team. He spent a few months on loan at Bolton in the second half of the 2014-15 season before leaving permanently to join Celtic.",
      "The last 11 years have seen him play club football in Scotland, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany and Switzerland - as well as a brief spell back in England with Nottingham Forest. He has also switched his international allegiances, playing for Gambia at two editions of the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "A fair amount of time had passed between Anderson signing for United and the Brazilian featuring in this match. Injuries had held back his career, and he would play just one more time for the club before returning to his home country with Internacional.",
      "In September 2020, the midfielder announced his retirement after stints in Brazil and Turkey. His final senior appearance had come more than a year earlier, for Adana Demirspor in the Turkish second tier.",
      "After starring under Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund, Kagawa showed some real quality at times in his first United season. He couldn't repeat the trick after Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, though, and returned to Dortmund days after the MK Dons defeat.",
      "Spells in Turkey, Spain, Greece and Belgium followed, before the playmaker returned to his first club Cerezo Osaka. Now 36 years of age, he has continued to get minutes for the club - who currently sit in mid-table in the J1 League.",
      "Powell announced himself at United with a debut goal, having been a teenage hit with Crewe, but is another who couldn't get things going after Ferguson walked away. David Moyes had sent him out on loan to Wigan, where he got more regular minutes in the Championship, but Van Gaal's arrival offered him a fresh chance at Old Trafford.",
      "Instead, his introduction in a 2015 Champions League game became emblematic of the struggles in the Van Gaal era for some United fans. Powell established himself as a solid Championship player in the years that followed, and is now in the third tier with Bradford, making his debut for the Bantams against Stoke on Tuesday.",
      "Welbeck is another to leave United in the aftermath of the Dons defeat, but this was a move some fans were less happy about. The homegrown talent completed a surprise deadline day move to Arsenal, and won two FA Cups during an injury-hit five years with the Gunners.",
      "At the age of 34, Welbeck has hit the best scoring form of his career. He's now at Brighton - via a year at Watford - and hit 10 goals in a Premier League season for the first time last term.",
      "Welbeck's partner up front in Milton Keynes was another who would soon be on his way. Hernandez joined Real Madrid on a season-long loan in September 2014, and would exit permanently the following summer.",
      "After spells with Leverkusen, West Ham and Sevilla, the Mexican international called time on his European career in 2020. Three years in MLS with LA Galaxy brought goals galore, and he's now back in Guadalajara - where he began his career nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Pereira, at the time just 18 years old, made his debut when he replaced Janko that night. The Brazilian would add one Premier League outing later that season, but his time at United was filled with loan moves away.",
      "He would end up playing 75 times for the first team, most of those appearances coming under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. A successful Flamengo loan breathed new life into his career, though, and he has been a Premier League semi-regular with Fulham since joining the London side from United in 2022.",
      "One of the few bright sparks of the David Moyes season, Januzaj never replicated that form under his successors. The Belgian played just 28 times under Van Gaal, while Jose Mourinho sent him on loan to Sunderland before sanctioning a permanent exit to Real Sociedad in 2017.",
      "Things went better for him in San Sebastian, though a spell at Sevilla has been largely spent on the fringes He's now back at Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan after a year on loan at Las Palmas, though, and featured from the bench in the first game of the new season.",
      "Wilson was highly rated by United's academy chiefs and scored twice on his Premier League debut in 2014. He got minutes under Van Gaal but not under Jose Mourinho, eventually leaving Old Trafford in 2019 after a series of loans.",
      "After a spell north of the border with Aberdeen, he spent the last five years in the lower leagues - most recently with Northampton. Wilson is currently a free agent, having left Sixfields in the summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roma have reportedly ended their pursuit of Jadon Sancho, with the Serie A club instead focusing their attention on a deal for Tyrique George. Sancho is part of a four-man bomb squad at Manchester United, having been frozen out by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and United are hoping to sell the winger before the transfer window slams shut, with Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Rasmus Hojlund also likely to leave.",
      "However, according to a report from Italian outlet La Gazzetta dello Sport, Roma's interest in Sancho has waned. Roma are desperate to strengthen out wide this summer and Sancho was their top target.",
      "Roma were said to have agreed a deal with United to sign him on loan with a £20million option to buy and the club had set Sancho a deadline to decide whether he wanted to join. However, his wages have proved to be an issue and the report states that he has not responded.",
      "As a result, Roma have switched their focus to Chelsea starlet George, who was team-mates with Sancho last season. The 19-year-old has impressed in his limited appearances for the Blues and Roma believe manager Gian Piero Gasperini can 'turn him into a new star'.",
      "The report states the move will be a permanent one rather than a loan, with George's wage demands 'significantly more affordable than Sancho's'.",
      "It is also claimed that Chelsea want to include a clause that would see them bank 30 per cent of whatever Roma sell George for. Interestingly, Sancho has previously hailed George and claimed the teenager \"has the world at his feet\".",
      "In a post on social media after George made his first Chelsea start in the Conference League last season, Sancho wrote: \"Tyrique has the world at his feet, top guy and such a humble human being. Deserves every bit of success coming his way!\"",
      "Chelsea defender Levi Colwill has also previously branded George an \"amazing\" talent. Speaking after George netted his first Premier League goal, Colwill said: \"We all know how good of a player he is.",
      "\"And for him to come in and score gives him a bit of a confidence boost and hopefully he keeps pushing and he tries getting into our side because that's why he's here, because he's an amazing player. He's not there to sit on the bench; he’s there to come and play.\"",

      "Manchester United have been cautioned that their potential next arrival Senne Lammens will need \"a miracle\" to succeed, as they balance several transfers before Monday's deadline. Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Lammens has been heavily touted for a switch to Old Trafford this summer in a move valued at £17million.",
      "The Turkey international faced criticism for his role in Arsenal's decisive goal on the opening weekend of the season. Despite retaining his position for Sunday's 1-1 draw with Fulham, he once again appeared shaky when handling crosses.",
      "With Onana also frequently scrutinised for errors throughout his two years at United, the urgency for Ruben Amorim to secure a fresh keeper to compete for the No.1 shirt now seems more critical than ever. The Red Devils' prospects of acquiring Lammens are currently precariously balanced, according to the latest reports, despite seeing off competition from Galatasaray.",
      "As per the Daily Mail, United are dependent on various other transfers materialising which could determine whether the 23-year-old arrives before the transfer window closes. United are still attempting to thrash out a deal with Chelsea for Alejandro Garnacho's switch to Stamford Bridge, whilst Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia remain at the club despite being deemed surplus to requirements.",
      "Even if the pursuit of Lammens proves fruitful, ex-United and Wrexham shot-stopper Ben Foster has expressed serious reservations about whether he possesses the quality to thrive in the Premier League.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"I actually watched a little highlight reel of him on YouTube, and he looks okay. I still don't think it's the answer, though.",
      "\"He looks like he's a decent young goalkeeper. But I just think to go and pluck somebody from Royal Antwerp and expect them to be able to be a world class goalkeeper in the Premier League, it's a miracle if you get it right.\"",
      "Foster also delivered an assessment of Bayindir's recent performances between the sticks, claiming he gets intimidated too easily from set-pieces. He further stressed his belief that the former Fenerbahce star shouldn't be United's number one choice in the long run.",
      "\"I think we're in agreement that Bayindir isn't the answer,\" he said. \"I thought he got very lucky on a couple occasions [at Fulham] where corners are coming into the box.",
      "\"I'm thinking that any time they get the chance to put the ball in the box, they're just going to stick it on top of Bayindir. They're just going to bully him out the way, and they're going to put the ball in the back of the net.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the potential arrival of Lammens at Old Trafford is reportedly not expected to affect Onana's position in the squad. Despite the Cameroonian goalkeeper missing out on the first two matches, he is tipped to make his debut in Wednesday's Carabao Cup clash against Grimsby.",

      "Harry Maguire is already convinced that Benjamin Sesko will give Premier League defenders nightmares as the Manchester United striker prepares to make his first start since joining from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko, 22, moved to Old Trafford earlier this month in a deal worth £73.7million as part of an attacking overhaul, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also joining for big money. However, while Cunha and Mbeumo have started both of United's Premier League games so far this season, Sesko has been eased into life in the top-flight with a substitute role.",
      "That stance has divided opinion with United scoring once in games against Arsenal and Fulham. But with plenty of changes expected when United travel to Grimsby Town in the League Cup on Wednesday night, Sesko is likely to get a longer run out.",
      "Regardless, Maguire thinks United's new striker has all the attributes he needs to be a hit in the Premier League - and that both starts and goals will soon come. He told United's official website: \"He’s [Sesko] a unit for his age. I’m sure he’s going to cause a lot of defenders problems. He’s still young, but he’s got all the attributes to contribute to the team and to contribute to this club for many years to come, so we’ll give him our full backing and, fingers crossed, he scores many goals for us.\"",
      "Gary Neville is among those who think starting Sesko against Grimsby should be a no-brainer for Ruben Amorim. The former Manchester United defender says Sesko is \"nowhere near\" up to speed in terms of fitness or an understanding of how the team play and that 90 minutes of action would benefit him regardless of the level of opposition.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, he said: “Sesko at the moment - let's just say it, he is nowhere near in terms of fitness or getting up to speed. Obviously there is a clamour to play him. Even I was saying last week let's get him straight in.",
      "“[Amorim] is going to have to get Sesko in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes so that he can be played [from the start] against Burnley next Saturday because you can see he needs football. What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "“The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep Mason Mount in the team. But when Sesko did come on and Mount went into midfield and they took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked [more likely] that Fulham would score.”",

      "After defeating Shrewsbury Town in the opening round, Grimsby have earned the chance to welcome the Premier League giants to their home ground. While Manchester United may not be the dominant force they once were, the magnitude of the occasion is undiminished for the League Two side.",
      "Eager to test themselves against top-flight opposition, the Mariners head into the clash on the back of a six-match unbeaten run to start their season. David Artell’s team have collected 11 points from their first five League Two games, boasting the joint-highest goal tally in the division.",
      "On paper, United are clear favourites, however, with only two wins in their last 13 away matches, the Red Devils’ recent record on the road will give Grimsby extra encouragement as they look to cause an upset.",

      "Real Madrid are reportedly eyeing a move for England international Adam Wharton if Dani Ceballos leaves the club this summer. Ceballos has been heavily linked with a move to Marseille and his departure could force Real Madrid to act.",
      "Los Blancos are one of several clubs that have been credited with an interest in Wharton, with Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City also said to be among the midfielder's admirers.",
      "However, a new report from Spanish outlet AS claims that Real Madrid are ready to accelerate their interest if Ceballos leaves with Xabi Alonso keen to bring in a replacement. Ceballos, who previously spent time on loan at Arsenal, wants more game time and Marseille are ready to offer him that.",
      "The report states that Marseille are hoping to agree a loan move with an obligation to buy, but the deal is yet to be finalised. The report states that Wharton is Real Madrid's top target, with Alonso a big fan of the 21-year-old.",
      "It is claimed it would cost more than €80million (£69m) to persuade Palace to sell and that although it 'would be a push' for Real Madrid, they would certainly explore a deal. The report adds that there are two potential alternatives to Wharton on the table.",
      "AZ Alkmaar midfielder Kees Smit is also of interest to Real Madrid, with scouts said to be regularly visiting the Dutch club to keep an eye on his progress. However, they could turn to 18-year-old academy starlet Thiago Pitarch instead.",
      "Alonso is said to be an admirer of the youngster and is 'considering the possibility of giving him a place in the squad if no one else arrives'. Pitarch signed a new long-term deal with Real Madrid earlier this month.",
      "They have already spent almost £200m on new signings so far this summer, with Dean Huijsen, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Alvaro Carreras and Franco Matantuono all making the move to the Bernabeu.",
      "However, they have not made any sales so far, with Luka Modric, Lucas Vazquez and Jesus Vallejo all departing on free transfers after their contracts expired. Speaking after Real Madrid's 3-0 win over Real Oviedo on Sunday, Alonso said: \"We have twenty-odd players in the squad and I'm going to try to get the best out of all of them.",

      "There could be a new name added to the long list of Manchester United's summer departures, and it's not one Ruben Amorim had in mind. Denmark Under-21 manager Lars Knudsen is hopeful Chido Obi can get minutes away from Old Trafford, with the young striker's first-team opportunities looking limited.",
      "Obi, who joined United from Arsenal last autumn, was handed a debut by Amorim last term. The 17-year-old played seven times in the Premier League, mostly from the bench, and played 52 minutes against Fulham in the FA Cup fifth round.",
      "Part of that was due to a lack of other options, though, and that isn't an issue this term. Amorim has added Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to United's front line, leaving Obi back with his club's Under-21s side - with a lack of European football restricting opportunities further.",
      "This isn't what Knudsen was hoping for, with Danish outlet Bold quoting the boss as saying: \"I can't stand here and say anything about that, because it's somewhere else than with me. It's just a hope we have for the national teams, because we know that playing time is crucial.",
      "\"This is both for performance, but also for these young people in terms of developing themselves. Of course, we hope that he will get somewhere where he can play.\"",
      "Obi, who is also eligible to represent England and Nigeria, appears to have nailed his colours to the mast with Denmark for now. He played twice for the Under-21 side in March, but returned to the Under-20 setup over the summer and scored in friendlies against Congo and Japan.",
      "Stefan Hojer, the manager of the Under-21s during the summer's Euros, has left for Aalborg with Knudsen taking over. The Danes begin their qualification campaign for the 2027 Under-21 Euros in September with a trip to Wales.",
      "A loan exit for Obi could end up being a solution if the right club is identified. Fellow youngsters Ethan Wheatley and Toby Collyer have both agreed season-long EFL moves, with Wheatley scoring his first goal for Northampton Town on Saturday.",
      "Back in March, Amorim was full of praise for Obi and young team-mate Ayden Heaven, who also joined from Arsenal's academy. \"They are players with talent and then, when you have this moment with some injuries, they have to be ready,\" the United head coach said.",
      "\"It's our tradition to put players in to play, especially in this moment. We have to focus on everything, the future is right there and the young kids can feel the club and can change things sometimes for us, without buying players.\"",

      "Just a fortnight into the 2025/26 Premier League season and some clubs are already showing their mettle. After the initial rounds of matches, an intriguing alternative perspective of the league standings has surfaced.",
      "Over the weekend, there were some standout results. Manchester City were left stunned by a surprise 2-0 home loss to Tottenham on Saturday, while Manchester United's woes persisted with a 1-1 stalemate at Fulham.",
      "Reigning champions Liverpool, albeit unimpressively, clinched two victories from two on Monday night at Newcastle, thanks to a last-minute winner from 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha. Chelsea also turned heads with a resounding 5-1 triumph over West Ham United.",
      "With a whopping 36 match rounds still to go, there's a lot of football yet to be played. However, with assistance from stats gurus Opta, a table based on each team's expected goals has been compiled, offering a unique measure of performance thus far.",
      "Expected goals (xG) is a metric derived from the value of chances and shots on goal from each Premier League team and has become a popular tool for assessing teams and performances. It provides a theoretical estimate of the number of goals a team should have scored. The table utilises statistics and data from the first two games of the season.",
      "Now it's not perfect. How else do you explain Chelsea topping the table? Because they failed to net in the 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace on opening day - and arguably deserved to lose that game - but following their emphatic victory over West Ham on Friday night where they created chances galore, they boast an xG Chelsea of 4.35.",
      "Arsenal sit second, with a 4.19 xG, having outperformed their expected goals by 1.81 after netting six in their first two matches. Meanwhile, Man Utd's struggles in the final third are evident, with Leny Yoro's solitary goal from a corner being their only goal so far this season. The data reveals that Ruben Amorim's squad has an xG of 3.15, which is 2.15 goals less than what they've actually scored.",
      "Brighton, who failed to find the back of the net against Everton, have the worst 'Goals vs XG' ratio at -2.91.",
      "Manchester City's xG stands at 4.02, largely due to their 4-0 thrashing of Wolves. Liverpool, following their thrilling victory over Newcastle, have an xG of 2.9 despite scoring seven goals in their opening two fixtures. Nottingham Forest and Brentford have an xG of 2.76 and 2.70 respectively, with the former scoring four goals and the latter underperforming with just two goals. Newcastle's xG is slightly lower than Liverpool's at 2.4.",

      "Manchester United's continued failures in the transfer market is best summed up by research and data which shows that their squad is now worth more than £300million LESS than they actually paid for it.",
      "Every club is looking for value in their recruitment. Getting a player for less than they're actually worth or signing one that goes on to blossom and is worth considerably more than they initially paid. For United, they've made a habit of doing the opposite.",
      "Gary Neville previously declared Old Trafford a \"graveyard\" for players and managers and the figures back up that statement. United's squad cost vs their actual value presents the largest deficit in the Premier League.",
      "They are £322.9m in the minus. They've spent £1.1billion but their squad is actually valued at £769m by Transfermarkt. For context, Arsenal are the best in the Premier League in this department. Their squad is worth £315.9m more than they actually paid - £826m vs £1.1bn. That owing to players like Martin Odegaard and William Saliba being worth considerably more than they were bought for.",
      "Manchester City also rank high. Liverpool and Newcastle are also in the plus, which has aided their ambitions. For United though it is a sorry story and you don't have to look far for the lack of value in their transfers.",
      "Actual cost against value often finds itself in the negative for two reasons. Firstly, a player was bought for big money late in their career, when their value was only going to decrease. Secondly, a player is bought but massively fails to live up to expectations.",
      "An example of a player being landed when their value is on the decline is Casemiro. The Brazilian joined from Real Madrid for £70m - and whilst he enjoyed a positive debut season - the red flags were quickly highlighted with the 33-year-old still on big wages but not performing like he once did.",
      "Meanwhile the list of players signed for big fees, only to underdeliver, is rife and has been for more than a decade. United have spent their entire summer trying to get some of their bigger names off their books having been unable to get the best from them.",
      "Antony joined in the summer of 2022 for £81m. A year earlier and Jadon Sancho cost them £72m. Now United will do well to recoup even half those figures should they move on either player before the transfer window closes in less than a week.",
      "Harry Maguire was the marquee signing in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first summer back in 2019, and whilst they have got six seasons out of the England defender, a man that cost them a world-record £80m is now valued at just £11m.",
      "This summer has been far more measured. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko have been signed for £206m. The former two are proven Premier League performers whilst Sesko is viewed as one of the best young strikers in Europe and, across his tenure in Manchester, should represent value for money.",
      "It is a marked improvement from the first summer under Ineos 12 months ago, with a number of those transfer ageing poorly and costing the club dearly. Erik ten Hag was allowed to pursue certain targets but Joshua Zirkzee, signed for £36.5m, is now worth £25m. Manuel Ugarte is another player who represents a hefty loss, which is why United find themselves so heavily in the red.",

      "Garnacho has been on the lookout for a United exit since head coach Ruben Amorim dropped him to the bench for the Europa League final in May. He was left out of Amorim's pre-season tour squad, but - while fellow 'bomb squad' member Marcus Rashford has sealed a loan move away - the Argentine is still at Old Trafford for now.",
      "According to The Mail, Chelsea's valuation sits between £25m and £35m. The Blues are believed to have agreed terms with the player, who has reportedly turned down interest from elsewhere - something which could be to Chelsea's benefit in negotiations with United.",
      "United have attempted to justify their valuation by pointing to Chelsea's sale of Noni Madueke, according to The Times. Madueke, who scored seven goals to Garnacho's six across comparable league minutes last term, joined Arsenal for £48m plus add-ons in July.",
      "In the meantime, Chelsea are close to sealing an exit of their own. Roma are reportedly close to a deal for Tyrique George, who broke through during last season's Conference League run but has dropped below new signings Estevao and Jamie Gittens in the pecking order.",
      "Garnacho isn't the only United player who the club are keen to offload before Monday's Premier League transfer deadline. Rasmus Hojlund looks set for Napoli, having missed out on a spot in Amorim's squad for the first two games of the new season.",
      "Antony's move to Real Betis remains possible, though the terms of a deal have yet to be ironed out. Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are also surplus to requirements, but finding a buyer for either player has proved tricky.",
      "United are due to take on Grimsby in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, with a first win of the season their target. After losing at home to Arsenal on the opening weekend, an Emile Smith Rowe equaliser denied Amorim's side victory at Fulham.",
      "“Yes. Yes, we have three games this week, we have quality players, and we need to do rotation to try to win every game,” Amorim said when asked if he would rotate for the cup tie.",
      "He also indicated Hojlund could be in contention to feature despite continued speculation over the striker's future, adding: “All the players are available. Then we will make the choice to get the best starting XI to win every game.”",

      "“Sacked in the morning.” “Can we play you every week?” “Premier League, you’re having a laugh.” Those were just three chants aimed at Manchester United by Grimsby Town supporters in the first half alone.",
      "That is Grimsby Town of League Two. The fourth tier in English football. A team that was competing in the National League a few years ago.",
      "This was not a United team teeming with unknowns or untried novices, as they were against Port Vale in 1994 or MK Dons in 2014. This was a United side assembled at a cost of £401.61million. For 45 minutes, this was worse than MK Dons.",
      "There was a United comeback, but it was incomplete. A marathon penalty shootout ended 12-11 to Grimsby Town. Bryan Mbeumo ended the charade by striking the crossbar.",
      "That sparked a mass pitch invasion. Bruno Fernandes rushed to Mbeumo to escort him off. Harry Maguire signalled to his teammates to head to the tunnel. United’s security personnel did likewise with alacrity.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s body language resembled that of a condemned coach for much of the night. At one point, he looked to be bickering with his assistant, Carlos Fernandes. Those sunny days in Chicago during the pre-season tour last month, where Amorim was tanned and breezy, feel like a reverie.",
      "Amorim, sodden from the biblical second-half rain, ran onto the pitch to fetch the ball in the 84th minute. “Oi, Amorim, your lot aren’t very good,” yelled a Grimsby fan. He was soon silenced by Harry Maguire’s equaliser.",
      "That was a brief reprieve. The shootout defeat tempers this humiliation but this will be remembered as one of United’s most shocking cup defeats. One to file with Bournemouth 1984, York City 1995, Southend 2006, Leeds 2010 and MK Dons 2014.",
      "Andre Onana headed down the tunnel at full-time, followed by goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital. He re-emerged and was advised to remain calm by Fernandes for the spotkicks. Fernandes was soon anything but, urging Altay Bayindir to advise Onana to hand the ball to United’s next taker.",
      "Onana produced a superb stop from Clarke Oduor in the penalty shootout yet was thereafter porous. Matheus Cunha lost his nerve with a potential matchwinning penalty. United's first two summer signings missed.",
      "United players are playing their way out of the club. That Amorim has messily mismanaged the goalkeeper situation does not account for Onana’s incompetence for both of Grimsby’s goals. Onana was flimsy for the first and a pushover for the second.",
      "Onana’s confidence has doubtless been harmed by the contrary call to start Bayindir in the opening Premier League games. That does not legislate for a League Two club making him look an amateur. Amorim did not appreciate the recommendation of Tom Heaton but he was the safest bet to start this season.",
      "At a club where anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, a former United academy member threatened to get the winner. Tyrell Warren spent part of his summer training with his long-time friend, Marcus Rashford, to prepare him for his transfer to Barcelona. Rashford can be forgiven for celebrating his old teammate's glory against his parent club.",
      "United’s starting academy defender, Tyler Fredricson, was a boy among men and repeatedly targeted but criminally devoid of a teammate to protect him. Maguire, captaining United at kick-off for the first time since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, regained his old form. He handed the armband back to Fernandes for the second half and connected with Mason Mount’s corner to extend the evening.",
      "But this was no rescue act. Instead, individuals, the head coach and his staff have been brutally exposed. Patrick Dorgu played kick-and-rush in the blood and thunder. He was not on the pitch when the torrential rain turned United’s shirts blood red. The sharks may scent blood soon.",
      "Dorgu was overpromoted and is being overplayed, starting every game by virtue of his status as the sole senior left winger. Dorgu is 20 years old and arrived from Lecce in January.",
      "Some are giving up on Manuel Ugarte at United and he looked to throw in the towel himself, staying prone and seeking a free kick seconds before Charles Vernam slammed the ball into the corner for the opening goal. Fredricson, Ugarte and Dorgu had to take their seats in the raucous main stand after their showers.",
      "Fernandes, Mbeumo and Matthijs de Ligt emerged at the pause. Diogo Dalot switched to the left wing and United had five No.10s and a striker in their front seven for the second half. Mbeumo scored one of the most uncelebrated first goals by a United player.",
      "Amorim’s head dropped and he slumped back down to his haunches when Amad lost the ball. That was at 0-0. Amorim was in a narky mood long before Grimsby changed the scoreboard and caused ripples in the North Sea.",
      "Grimsby will not have cowed a team more easily than United. Cowards may be a more fitting description. Rumbustious tackles put certain individuals out of the game, the tone set by an early and fair challenge on Amad. Rather than get up, he milked the contact. Amad did not fancy it.",
      "Amorim lost his rag inside two minutes, smacking his hands and shouting in the direction of Dorgu. He was more demonstrative than usual and constantly on Sesko’s case, piqued that he was positionally distant without the ball.",
      "Sesko was out of kilter with his new teammates. Hardly a shock when he was held back in the first two fixtures against Arsenal and Fulham. United seem oblivious as to how to function with a centre forward in their starting XI. It was hardly a ringing endorsement that Sesko was the final outfield player to take a penalty kick.",
      "Calendars have not been turned over to September and opposition supporters are already wondering when Amorim will go. The United away end, already subdued at 0-0, was numb at 1-0 and catatonic at 2-0. They eventually mustered a rendition of ‘We’ll never die’ as half-time loomed and that was funereal.",
      "1,200 United supporters crammed into a stand with advertising for Winner Winner Chicken Dinner and Copes Readymix Ltd. This was a more authentic ground than United’s last second-round League Cup tie, the infamous 4-0 shellacking at MK Dons in 2014. The parallels were glaring.",
      "Louis van Gaal fielded the untried that evening and was so unfussed by the hammering he started signing autographs at full-time. Amorim could not afford to be as blasé and United were still worse than Louis’s lambs that were slaughtered 11 years ago.",
      "United’s pricey substitutes were heckled with the familiar Football League chorus of, “Who are ya?” De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee were without a seat and were ordered to move further back by the fastidious fourth official. There was not a spare seat at the all-seater Blundell Park as 8,647 spectators packed it out.",
      "Amorim is almost on his knees.",

      "The loss is destined to be ranked among United's biggest domestic cup embarrassments and restricts them to one realistic option of silverware this season in the FA Cup.",
      "Amorim said the players \"spoke really loud today what they want\", effectively suggesting they did not fancy the challenge against the fourth-tier team.",

      "\"I would like to say very smart things and very important things. I have nothing to say. Nothing to say. That is the biggest problem also. To see the same mistakes and nothing to say in this moment. I'm really sorry for our fans. It's too much sometimes.",

      "\"It's not about Andre,\" Amorim stressed. \"We are here with all due respect. I already said that the best team won. But this is a fourth division team. Andre should play just with his feet during this game? It's not that that happened.",
      "\"It's not the goalkeeper. It's more than that. He's everybody. Thank you guys.\"",

      "The other is poised to play against United for Grimsby Town on Wednesday night. \"I think I should be playing,\" Tyrell Warren says, hopefully.",
      "Warren was part of Mourinho's first training squad at United back in July 2016. The right back was 17 at the time and yet to make his first start for the Under 21s.",
      "\"It was mad, to be fair, it was crazy,\" Warren says over the phone. \"I didn’t really expect it. I came back from summer and (academy head) Nicky Butt said I was with the first team, which I was a bit surprised with. But I just had to go out and train and show what I can do.\"",
      "Mourinho suggested Warren would travel to Wigan Athletic for his first match in charge, a pre-season friendly. Ultimately, there was no space for Warren on the bench at the DW Stadium. His memories of training under Mourinho and Rui Faria are still vivid.",
      "\"It was good, I enjoyed it,\" he recalled. \"It was about two weeks before the first game against Wigan but I learnt a lot from Mourinho and the players, the tempo of training, how hard you’re training. And I just took that back to the youth team and tried to do that in the training sessions with them.\"",
      "Mancunian Warren, now 26, spent 14 years in the United academy. He was first spotted playing for Chorlton St Griffins at the age of \"six or seven\" and signed for the club's under 9s. Warren was a fast riser, playing in the Milk Cup at 15 in 2014 and debuting for the reserves at the age of 17 in 2016.",
      "He played a small but key role in the Under 21s' 2015-16 title triumph. Back when Louis van Gaal ordered fringe first team players to drop down to the reserves, Warren trained with Adnan Januzaj and Andreas Pereira.",
      "Warren Joyce, the second string's manager, was renowned for turning boys into men through unforgiving methods. \"He was tough,\" Warren admits. \"He’d get you physically and mentally strong.",
      "\"I was a younger player in the academy, you’re training with all the reserves. His philosophy is don’t be scared of anyone, just battle them and that’s how I play my game. Just no fear really, that comes from training with Warren.\"",
      "When Warren was 15, he took his seat on the far right of the front row and posed for the annual class photo at Carrington in July 2014. Inexplicably, the picture was not published for six years. It has aged well.",
      "Among the line-up are McTominay, Axel Tuanzebe, Dean Henderson, Demetri Mitchell, Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, Joe Riley and Marcus Rashford. All went on to play for United.",
      "There are other familiar faces. Jimmy Dunne has played more than 100 times for Queens Park Rangers, Ollie Rathbone is also playing in the Championship for Wrexham, Devonte Redmond was at the Racecourse Ground for the start of the Reynolds and McElhenney era while Callum Gribbin was a talked-about prodigy.",
      "Warren remains close with Rashford, so much so he was part of his inner circle that trained and holidayed together in Cannes over the summer. Rashford went to watch Warren play for Barrow three years ago.",
      "\"There were obviously a few of us at the time, all the same ages, all from Manchester, from the same area in Manchester, playing for the same local teams in that area and district,\" Warren recalls, \"so it was easy to get on with each other and get to know each other.",
      "\"He (Rashford)’s been to a few of my games with the rest of my mates and it’s interesting to see he’ll still come and watch with his mates. He’s not forgotten about friendship and it’s all about friendship.\"",
      "Warren is confident Rashford will regain the world-class form he displayed for United three seasons ago on loan at Barcelona. \"Yeah, definitely. He's capable of getting back to that level. Everyone in the world knows what he can do and I’m sure he’ll show everyone in the world this season what he can do.\"",
      "This week's League Cup tie is a sentimental reward for Warren, who admits he fell out of love with football after he left United in 2019. \"It’s like, where now? United’s such a big club and so high up you can only really go down. I went to a few places where it wasn’t really working out. There were a few knockbacks and I just found love by playing football again.\"",
      "After an unfulfilling year at Salford City, he plied his trade in non-league for a couple of years until a breakthrough move to Football League side Barrow in 2022. When United visited Holker Street for an EFL Trophy early into the season, Warren entered the boardroom to reunite with academy head Nick Cox and club stalwarts Tony Whelan, Dave Bushell and Eamon Mulvey. The small gesture meant a lot to Cox.",
      "Warren joined Grimsby in 2024 and the Mariners just missed out on a play-off spot last season. They have made an unbeaten start to the campaign as they prepare for United's first visit to Blundell Park since 1948.",
      "So how did Warren, a boyhood United fan, react to the second-round draw? \"The funny thing is I was sleeping when the draw happened!\" he chuckles. \"Two of my teammates ran into my room and told me we’d got United at home and woke me up.

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news, views and rumours on Wednesday, August 27.",
      "With only a week left in the summer transfer window, United are aware that they need to act swiftly to secure any deals - and it appears their next summer signing is imminent.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is poised to arrive at Old Trafford, having been absent from the Belgian team's match against Mechelen on Sunday. Lammens is anticipated to complete a £17million move to United.",
      "This signing is likely to cast further uncertainty over the futures of Andre Onana and Altiy Bayindir. Ruben Amorim once again selected Banindir as his starting goalkeeper for the 1-1 draw at Fulham over the weekend.",
      "United were also being linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper appears to be on his way to Manchester City.",
      "In the meantime, Reds captain Bruno Fernandes continues to attract attention from Saudi Arabia, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund could all depart the club within the next week.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "United are said to have identified a potential replacement for either Bruno Fernandes or Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "TEAMtalk cite sources in their reporting that Angelo Stiller is a player the club's recruitment staff view as a possible successor to those two midfielders, the in-demand Stuttgart star profiled and admired by United.",
      "United are understood to have not agreed a deal with Chelsea to sign Alejandro Garnacho despite reports to the contrary.",
      "The player leaving over the coming days appears inevitable, but claims that a deal is done appear premature at this point, with under a week remaining of the summer transfer window.",
      "Steven Railston reports that Sam Mather is expected to leave the club ahead of the summer transfer window deadline.",
      "Mather is set to leave United for the next chapter of his development, and the youngster is likely to move abroad, having received interest from clubs in Germany, Sweden and Turkey.",
      "Napoli are said to want Kobbie Mainoo and will reportedly raise of prospect of doing a deal during their ongoing negotiations with United over signing Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Mail claims they have an advantage over their Serie A rivals Roma due to them being in the Champions League this season.",
      "Jadon Sancho is reportedly an option for Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "TBR Football claims the situation is one to keep an eye on. However, they acknowledge that Tottenham are still working on other deals for a new winger first, as they have yet to replace their departed captain, Son Heung-Min, this summer.",
      "United are reportedly very optimistic about finalising a deal for Senne Lammens by tomorrow.",
      "German journalist Christopher Michel claims this is the case after acknowledging that Royal Antwerp are willing to let the goalkeeper go after omitting Lammens from their squad last weekend versus KV Mechelen amid ongoing transfer talks.",
      "United are said to be considering Conor Gallagher as an alternative to Carlos Baleba.",
      "TBR Football also claims that as many as half a dozen Premier League clubs are monitoring the player's situation. Crystal Palace, Everton, Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United are also credited with an interest.",
      "United are said to have not given Chelsea the go-ahead during their talks over Garnacho.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims the Blues are still waiting after confirming a proposal worth between £35million and £40million. However, it is now described as a matter of time until the deal happens between the two clubs.",
      "United are reportedly close to agreeing a deal with Chelsea for Alejandro Garnacho worth as much as £40million.",
      "The Telegraph claims that United initially benchmarked the player's value against the £50million that Arsenal paid the Blues for Noni Madueke. They also claim that Kobbie Mainoo is currently not for sale.",
      "Journalist Yagiz Sabuncuohlu has reported that Galatasaray are pushing to hijack Man United's move for Senne Lammens.",
      "The journalist has claimed that a representative from Gala has travelled to Belgium to meet with Royal Antwerp in an attempt to sign the goalkeeper.",
      "It's also claimed that the Turkish side's bid surpasses the one on the table from United.",
      "Newcastle United have reportedly 'asked' Man United about the conditions to sign Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Journalist Jason Soutar has revealed to TEAMTalk that the Magpies want Mainoo and they are keen to bring him to the club this summer. Newcastle are the latest team to join the race for his signature with Real Madrid and Tottenham briefly linked.",
      "Altay Bayindir has reportedly turned down the chance to sign for Turkish champions Galatasaray.",
      "According to Turkish Football, the 27-year-old's priority is to remain at Old Trafford and compete for the number one spot. Bayindir has played the first two games of the season for United over Andre Onana.",
      "Manchester United will likely be busy right up until the end of the transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will be looking to shift those not in the head coach's plans, with Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho among them.",
      "United have been busy this summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to freshen up a side that struggled last season.",
      "The bookmakers Bet365, meanwhile, reckon the only incoming player United will sign is Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. Uncertainty in the goalkeeper department remains with Andre Onana potentially on the way out of Old Trafford.",
      "Bet365 have priced Martinez to sign for United as a 3/1 shot with the Argentina star remaining at Villa a very short 2/9.",
      "As for any other deals, Kobbie Mainoo could be on the way out amid uncertainty over his future but Bet365 reckon he will stay at his boyhood club with their price for that to happen 2/5.",
      "Ollie Watkins has been linked with United over the summer, but that's unlikely to happen and is reflected in Bet365's odds of 14/1 for the transfer to go through.",
      "18+ only. Please gamble responsibly. Begambleaware.org.",
      "Man United could rival Chelsea for Barcelona playmaker Fermin Lopez before next week's deadline.",
      "The Blues have made Lopez one of their midfield targets in the final week with reports in Spain suggesting a bid worth £43.2m. Cadena COPE have claimed, though, that Sporting director Deco is ready to sanction a deal but for £60m.",
      "The Evening Standard have namechecked United as a possible shock destination.",
      "Roma sporting director Frederic Massara reportedly flew to the UK on Monday to hold talks with Jadon Sancho this week as a last-gasp opporutnity to secure a deal.",
      "Gianluca Di Marzio has reported that the meeting revealed one outcome. \"Affter the meeting in London between the Giallorossi sporting director, Frederic Massara, and the Englishman’s entourage, the definitive answer has arrived: the Manchester United winger seems not to have definitively accepted the offer of the Giallorossi club.\"",
      "Caught Offside have reported that there is a 'broad agreement' in place between Man United and Chelsea for Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "After some time to agree on a fee, the report states that both clubs will settle in the region of a £50m package, including add-ons. There remains some details to iron it but a move is closing in.",
      "Brighton & Hove Albon have reportedly 'opened talks' with Man United over a potential deal to sign Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Football Transfers have claimed that the Seagulls have spoken with the representatives of Mainoo. The report claims that the England international is viewed as a strong fit for their style of play.",
      "Gary Neville has warned Manchester United that Benjamin Sesko could make the Reds more open when he gets into their side. However, the ex-United captain has insisted that Ruben Amorim must start the Slovenia frontman against Grimsby Town on Wednesday night.",
      "The striker arrived at Old Trafford from RB Leipzig this summer for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus an additional €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons - signing a five-year contract. United were confident that the 22-year-old favoured a move to Manchester over Premier League Newcastle and acted promptly to finalise the deal.",
      "But Sesko has yet to start for Amorim's team since arriving at M16 - initially making substitute appearances against Arsenal and Fulham so far this season. There is an expectation that the forward will make his first start for United in Wednesday night's League Cup clash at Grimsby (8pm).",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United will be chasing their first win of the season when they travel to Grimsby Town tonight.",
      "It's perhaps no surprise that Ruben Amorim's team have made a slow start to 2025/26. United's opening fixture against Arsenal was always going to be a tall order, considering the opposing directions of both clubs in recent times.",
      "The Reds played well in their 1-0 defeat to Mikel Arteta's side - but still lost at home to a team they earned a point against last term. The 1-1 draw at Fulham a week later was perhaps of greater concern, although United have rarely had an easy game at Craven Cottage in recent times.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United will be targeting a first win of the season when they face Grimsby Town in the second round of the Carabao Cup at Blundell Park on Wednesday night.",
      "As a result of failing to qualify for Europe this season, United are entering the competition at the second round stage for the first time since 2014 when they infamously lost 4-0 to MK Dons under Louis van Gaal.",
      "The Reds will travel to Lincolnshire with the ambition of securing a first win of the campaign after squandering the lead to draw 1-1 with Fulham in the Premier League at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon.",

      "Man United have reportedly failed in a bid to sign PSG striker Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "CaughtOffside claim that the Frenchman favours a permanent transfer to Juventus, but the Italian giants are yet to reach an agreement with PSG. It is claimed that United made contact; however, the player was not keen.",
      "The Reds had considered signing the 26-year-old from Eintracht Frankfurt in the summer of 2023, but instead chose to purchase Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "When a team changes manager and the dust settles following the initial hysteria, often one of the first questions to be asked is which players will benefit most from the new man's arrival.",
      "If a manager can start to get a tune out of an expensive recruit who has so far failed to prove their worth, they've instant credit in the bank from fans and those within the club's hierarchy.",
      "But there's a lot more to it than 'they played well under them before and so this time should be no different'. Take Erik ten Hag's arrival at United as an example.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have under a week to conclude their summer transfer business.",
      "The window closes at 7pm on Monday (September 1), which is earlier than in previous years. United still have work to do in the market and are set to be busy, particularly because outgoings still need to be arranged.",
      "Ruben Amorim has strengthened his squad with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon, but there could be more additions before the deadline.",
      "Read more here",
      "Headphones on and clutching two iPhones and a washbag, Kobbie Mainoo exited the Manchester United coach via the rear exit on the Stevenage Road.",
      "Plenty of fans hollered, \"Kobbie\" but Mainoo vanished from sight as quickly as he placed the ball past Stefan Ortega in the 2024 FA Cup final. He lingered longer on the Craven Cottage pitch at full-time, anticipating a warm down.",
      "The only ball work Mainoo ended up doing at Fulham was in the warm up, a two-touch exercise that United substitutes favour. That was the happiest Mainoo looked all afternoon.",
      "Without the ball, the 20-year-old appeared glum, almost disillusioned. His smile has been replaced with a forlorn frown. Including pre-season, Mainoo has started in two of United's seven matches.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has brutally shut down a post on social media which compares him with Leny Yoro.",
      "Ferdinand is recognised as one of United's greatest centre-backs, having made over 450 appearances for the Reds where he won 15 major trophies. The ex-defender left Old Trafford in 2014 when he moved to Queens Park Rangers before retiring from the professional game a year later.",
      "Current Reds centre-back Yoro arrived at M16 from Lille last summer and, at 19, is regarded as one of the finest young defenders in European football. United beat competition from Real Madrid and Liverpool to secure the Frenchman's signature.",
      "Read more here",
      "The key areas that need filling are goalkeeper and a new central midfielder, with both positions exposed in the two Premier League matches Ruben Amorim's side have played so far. Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have both struggled over the last year or so, and there will be hope that Senne Lammens can step up if his move from Royal Antwerp is completed.",
      "United need a reliable No.1 who can feature every week for Amorim's team. It's a position they have badly struggled with since David de Gea's peak in ended in the early 2020s and there must be serious question marks over whether Lammens can step up to such a high-pressured role at just 23.",
      "In terms of midfield - Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba would be the dream addition. Of course, his £100million plus price tag will make any deal extremely unlikely this summer.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Inter Milan have reportedly joined the race to sign Jadon Sancho. TEAMtalkclaim the Italian giants are looking to reinforce their attack before the window closes.",
      "The 25-year-old has been linked with AS Roma recently, but he has yet to complete his move to Italy. Sancho is currently training away from United's first team with the former Borussia Dortmund star keen to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Read more here",
      "Napoli are closing in on the loan signing of Rasmus Hojlund from Manchester United.",
      "The Italian champions initially proposed only a loan move but United insisted that an obligation to buy also be inserted into the deal.",
      "Hojlund, 22, previously generated interest from AC Milan but Napoli emerged as the frontrunners after Romelu Lukaku was ruled out for up to four months.",
      "United required a £38.4m (€44.44m) fee to avoid a loss on Hojlund, whom they bought for £64m rising to £72m two years ago, under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. Due to Hojlund's and United's form last season, a permanent transfer always seemed unforeseeable.",
      "Read more here",
      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage this morning. United have just a week left to strengthen their squad before the summer transfer window closes at 7pm on Monday, September 1.",
      "It may be early days in the 2025/26 campaign, but all evidence so far suggests that the Reds still have plenty of work to do. That will surprise few after such a disastrous campaign last term, and yet the scale of United's rebuild often causes astonishment.",
      "With that said, keep up to date with all the latest from M16 in our live blog throughout the day.",
      "The Athletic claims Mainoo is open to leaving Man United this summer.",
      "Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are alert to the youngster's situation with boss Ruben Amorim seemingly preferring other midfielders.",
      "He has entered the final 24 months of his contract at M16."

      "Although Mather's contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027, there is a hunger on the player's behalf for regular starts after outgrowing academy football with the Under-21s.",

      "Ruben Amorim will hope his side can mount a comeback in the second half, and he has plenty of options available to him on the bench. Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes could be introduced in the second half, while Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee could also be turned to.",
      "So, if United can get themselves back into the game, could it go to extra-time?",
      "If the scores are level after 90 minutes, the game will not go to extra-time.",
      "The winner will be determined by a penalty shootout straight after the final whistle.",
      "Extra-time will be used in the latter stages of the competition, but it is only introduced at the semi-final stage.",

      "Charles Vernam found the net to break the deadlock for the home. Fernandes appeared devastated by his team's defensive lapse, with television cameras capturing him burying his face in his palms, but Matters deteriorated further when Tyrell Warren scored.",

      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022.",
      "When a team changes manager and the dust settles following the initial hysteria, often one of the first questions to be asked is which players will benefit most from the new man's arrival.",
      "If a manager can start to get a tune out of an expensive recruit who has so far failed to prove their worth, they've instant credit in the bank from fans and those within the club's hierarchy.",
      "But there's a lot more to it than 'they played well under them before and so this time should be no different'. Take Erik ten Hag's arrival at United as an example.",
      "The Dutchman was keen to surround himself with home comforts, regularly targeting players either from, or who had spent time in, the Eredivisie. Yet, having inherited a player he had coached previously at Ajax in Donny van de Beek, he failed to get the best out of the midfielder, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had before him, and Van de Beek was shipped off to Girona after playing just eight league games in two years under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ruben Amorim was appointed United manager in November 2024, it would be wrong to suggest there was instant hope that he could get the best out of Manuel Ugarte. The pair worked together at Sporting Lisbon, and with Ugarte not even three months into his United career, the jury was well and truly still out on the Uruguayan.",
      "Fast forward nine months and there is a real worry Amorim will not get to see the best of the 24-year-old midfielder at United.",
      "Ugarte was brought to United for a fee rising to £50.75million on transfer deadline day last summer. The Uruguay international was signed to be the successor to Casemiro in United's midfield, yet the man he was brought in to replace has started ahead of him in both Premier League games so far this season.",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star showed glimpses of promise during pre-season, most notably against West Ham where he was one of the best players on the pitch in a 2-1 win in New Jersey.

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly considering departing the club next summer despite rejecting a hugely lucrative proposal from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes was strongly linked with a switch to Al-Hilal earlier this summer, but he eventually chose to decline their approach. Al-Hilal weighed up a £100million offer and were prepared to hand Fernandes £700,000-a-week and he could have pocketed approximately £200million across a three-year contract.",
      "Nevertheless, he has subsequently been connected with a switch to another Saudi Pro League outfit, with Al-Ittihad reportedly having held discussions with Fernandes' agents. The Daily Mail claim that Fernandes wishes to stay at United for another season in order to 'avoid any disruption' before the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The report suggests that he would then contemplate departing following the tournament. It is alleged Fernandes would be willing to join a side in Saudi Arabia, America or another prominent European division.",
      "\"I think I'm still in a position where I'm helpful so the thing for me is that I will be here until the club decides that 'Bruno, it's time to go'. Obviously, I know it was tough on the club to decide that because it was a big amount of money that the club hasn't got probably since Cristiano [Ronaldo] left, he was the last one where they got so much money for a player.",
      "\"I know for the club it was tough to decide. Because on one side I'm the club captain, I'm important for them, even if at times I've not been great, I've been performing and everything. I know that in the public eye it will be bad if things go wrong. But it would be very good if things go well – if they sell me and they get more players and whatever. But in my mind I've always said that this is the place I want to be.",
      "\"The dream of coming and playing in the Premier League, because for me it is the biggest league in the world and I want to fulfil my dreams of staying here and winning more things with the club. Obviously I know people will have different opinions – he's 30 years old, he's getting old..\"",
      "He went on to say: \"It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career.",
      "\"She was someone who always supported me a lot. It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, and I feel capable of it.\"",

      "Real Madrid and fierce rival Atletico Madrid are said to be among the European heavyweights keeping an eye on Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo amid ongoing uncertainty around his future at Old Trafford.",
      "That's according to Mike Keegan of the Daily Mail, who claims the La Liga giants have joined the list of Premier League clubs weighing up a move for the United academy graduate.",
      "The report claims a season-long loan would interest both Spanish clubs, with the England international struggling for game time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mainoo's future at Old Trafford is uncertain despite having two-years remaining on his current deal, with the club having the option of another year. However, the 20-year-old rejected the terms of a new deal back in January, meaning he's on the same deal which he signed as a 17-year-old breaking into the United set-up.",
      "Chelsea were linked with a swoop for the highly rated midfielder, but he'd remain at Old Trafford for the remainder of the campaign. Things haven't improved in terms of regular gametime for Mainoo since the start of the current campaign and is well down Amorim's pecking order.",
      "The Stockport-born star has not been able to nail down a spot in the starting XI after returning from injury back in December and the report claims he wants regular first team football.",
      "It's unlikely that United will allow the midfielder to leave on loan given their lack of options in central midfield and the club are reportedly set to make a decision in the next 48 hours regarding his future.",
      "Mainoo's lack of first-team minutes has baffled United supporters on the whole, especially given the club's struggles last season. His impressive breakthrough campaign saw him start the European Championship final for England against Spain last summer, but has not been able to nail down a spot in Amorim's 3-4-3 system.",
      "Had you told United supporters that Mainoo would no longer be considered untouchable on the back of last summer, very few would have believed you. The fact that both Real and Ateltico Madrid are keeping tabs on the midfielder tells you everything you need to know about the quality he possesses and the United boss MUST find a way of incorporating him in the XI.",

      "The England international has been in talks with United over a new deal, but the 20-year-old turned down the club's initial proposal at the start of 2025, with Chelsea linked with a move for the midfielder back in the January transfer window.",
      "Mainoo endured two length injury lay-offs last season and has started just 15 games since Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford. He has two-years remaining on the deal he signed when he was a 17-year-old, with his contract set to expire in 2027, though United do have the option of an additional year.",
      "When recently asked about Mainoo's future at the club, Amorim stated it was down to director of football Jason Wilcox to agree new terms with players.\"That part is with Jason, so he is our player,\" Amorim said. \"He has a contract, I didn’t hear any news about that.\"",
      "Although Mainoo has struggled for minutes and hasn't yet started a game this season, the lack of central midfield options means he'll likely stay at the club beyond the September deadline. Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped speculation increasing in relation to Mainoo's future.",
      "A recent report from The Athletic claims Mainoo 'is open to leave Manchester United' due to Amorim prefering other midfield options, though the England international's options are limited.",
      "It would come as a major disappointment for the United faithful if Mainoo were to depart, given the Stockport-born star has already made it clear that playing for Manchester United has been a dream of his since joining the academy as a nine-year-old.",
      "\"To start playing in the Premier League for my boyhood club has been amazing. Now it's about trying to win more games.\"",
      "Unlike the Janaury transfer window, where Mainoo was heavily linked with a move to Premier League rivals Chelsea, there's been very little speculation about his future.",
      "Leeds United have been linked with a move for the England international, though there's very little to suggest the newly promoted side will make a move at this stage, especially seeing as Daniel Farke admitted his midfield transfer business was complete earlier this month.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders and it is a different way of playing,\" Amorim made clear ahead of the trip to Fulham last weekend, regarding Mainoo's lack of minutes. \"They have to understand, the young players, there are phases in the season.",
      "\"Nowadays it's normal, with a lot of games, things are going to change. But he is there, he is fighting, he is training, he is one more option for us to win games.\"",

      "Two weeks into the 2025/26 Premier League season and some teams have already started to demonstrate their ambitions. Following the opening rounds of games, an alternative view of the table has emerged that provides interesting viewing.",
      "Over the weekend, there were some noticeable results. Manchester City suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham on Saturday before Manchester United's frustrations continued with a 1-1 draw at Fulham.",
      "Champions Liverpool, unconvincingly, made it two wins from two on Monday night at Newcastle thanks to 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha's injury-time winner. Chelsea also caught the eye with an emphatic 5-1 win over West Ham United.",
      "With 36 rounds of matches to go, there is plenty of football to play. But with help from stats specialists Opta, a table based on the expected goals for each team has been produced which provides a specific metric of performance so far.",
      "Expected goals (xG) is a metric calculated based on the value of opportunities and shots on goal from each Premier League team and has become a widely-used measure to evaluate teams and performances. It provides an estimate of the number of goals a team should have theoretically scored.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The table uses statistics and data from the first two games of the season. No surprise, after the resounding win over West Ham on Friday, Chelsea top the table with an xG of 4.35, despite failing to score in the 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace.",
      "Behind them is Arsenal with 4.19 xG after scoring six in their first two games. It means the Gunners have outperformed their xG by 1.81. Elsewhere, United's early problems in the final third are clear with Leny Yoro's goal on Sunday, from a corner, their only one this season so far.",
      "According to the data, Ruben Amorim's men have an xG of 3.15, which is 2.15 goals below what they have actually scored. Only Brighton (-2.91) have a worse 'Goals vs XG' ratio after they failed to score against Everton at the weekend.",
      "Man City's xG sits at 4.02, which largely comes from the 4-0 win at Wolves. Following their dramatic win at Newcastle, Liverpool have an xG of 2.9 despite scoring seven goals in their first two games.",
      "Nottingham Forest have an xG of 2.76, despite scoring four goals, while Brentford are underperforming their 2.70 xG with two goals scored so far. Newcastle's is slightly lower than the Reds at 2.4.",
      "Tottenham and Sunderland have both scored more than what the xG portrays. Thomas Frank's men have scored five times compared to the 3.43 xG whereas the Black Cats' blank at Burnley still has them outperforming their xG of 1.53.",

      "Therefore, United will have to overcome the League Two Mariners to join the likes of City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea in the third round draw.",

      "Unlike for the second round draw that was made earlier this month, the third round draw will be made following the conclusion of all second round ties and will immediately follow the conclusion of United's clash with Grimsby, at approximately 10pm.",
      "Outlining how the third round will unfold, the EFL said in a statement: \"Following the expansion of the European competition calendar ahead of the 2024/25 season, the EFL will again be required to implement additional conditions for the Carabao Cup Round Three draw.",
      "\"In-line with last year's competition, this season's Carabao Cup Round Three fixtures will take place across two weeks (beginning 15 and 22 September), with fixtures in the Champions League (week beginning 15 September) and Europa League (week beginning 22 September) also scheduled during this period.",
      "\"As UEFA competition fixtures cannot be rescheduled, and to enable the Carabao Cup to proceed within its agreed schedule without disrupting other League or domestic cup fixtures, the additional conditions will ensure that Clubs participating in the Champions League or Europa League cannot meet each other in Round Three of the League Cup.",
      "\"This will ensure that both teams drawn in each tie will be able to fulfil the fixture in one of the allocated weeks.",
      "\"It would always be the EFL's preference to conduct the draw in the traditional manner, but these changes have been forced upon us for the second season in succession as a result of UEFA's failure to consult with the Leagues of Europe prior to finalising its competition schedule.\"",
      "Offering more information on how the draw will work, the EFL added: \"For the main draw, two separate bowls will be utilised – one consisting of the eight UCL (Champions League) and UEL Clubs (Europa League), and one consisting of the remaining 24 Clubs.",
      "\"As the balls will be split across two pots, a pre-draw will be required first to determine whether each of the eight UCL/UEL teams will be playing home or away.",
      "\"For the main draw, the first eight-ties will be drawn by alternating between one Club from Bowl 1 and one Club from Bowl 2, with the Home/Away positioning of the UCL/UEL team already pre-determined in the earlier draw.",
      "\"Once the first eight ties featuring the UCL/UEL teams have been drawn, the remaining eight ties will then be drawn from Bowl 2 only.\"",
      "The ball numbers are yet to be confirmed for the draw.",

      "Those attributes coupled with his calming influence on a backline would be welcome at Old Trafford and provide the sort of stability United have been seeking between the posts, as Lammens himself said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "17=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nIt is still very early days but really not much more Thomas Frank could have done. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’d get on operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",
      "",
      "17=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nAn earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.",
      "",
      "11=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "11=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "11=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "11=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "11=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "10) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "7) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "4) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "3) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he?",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Losing late in the Carabao Cup certainly hasn’t helped.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nAlways felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner."

      "The general consensus at F365 over the summer was that we actually quite wanted Manchester United to do well this season. Mainly because of the thankless task of writing about game after game in which players unsuited to Ruben Amorim’s system failed to make the necessary adaptations. The strikers didn’t score goals, they didn’t create enough chances, the midfield left them horribly exposed, etc. etc.",
      "And it got to a point where it was pretty clear that no matter the depths plumbed by the worst Manchester United team in living memory, Amorim would not be sacked, particularly with the potential for the Europa League trophy and ensuing Champions League football offering end-of-term sprinkles to decorate the turd that was the Portuguese manager’s debut season.",
      "We weren’t allowed to forget that Amorim didn’t want to arrive mid-season and was pushed to make the move in a ‘now or never’ ultimatum from CEO Omar Berrada.

At fault for both goals – allowing the first to squeeze under his body and coming to flap at a cross for the second – it was a performance to leave absolutely no doubt over the requirement for a new goalkeeper this summer even before his breadstick wrists cost United in the shootout.",
      "But previous reports have suggested that doubts over that need have come from Amorim, whose off-season declaration of ‘trust’ in Onana was evidently misplaced on the basis of last season, while his claim only last week that he’s “happy with the three goalkeepers” points to either a hugely worrying lack of knowledge as to what it takes to be a Manchester United No.1 or direction from the hierarchy to temper expectations over the club’s wherewithal to sign a replacement.",
      "And in any case, unless either Senne Lammens or Gianluigi Donnarumma can provide midfield stability while simultaneously holding the ball up and creating chances, United’s problems will not be solved by a new goalkeeper.",
      "We all got a bit carried away after United impressed against Arsenal and none more so than Amorim, who claimed – after losing, lest we forget – that “we proved that we can beat every team in the Premier League.”",
      "Not Fulham though, nor League Two Grimsby Town, who are three divisions and 56 places below Manchester United in the football pyramid and have a squad market value which is approximately four per cent of what their visitors paid for their new striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "His first start for the club won’t have convinced anyone that he’s any sort of upgrade on Rasmus Hojlund, who might just have scored had he had Sesko’s chance to score in stoppage time from four yards out and probably wouldn’t have been the last outfield player to take a penalty in the shootout. What was all that about? Not very Manchester United, is it now.",
      "And after Bryan Mbeumo came off the bench at half-time to join him and Matheus Cunha to complete the summer signing forward triumvirate, what was a burgeoning hope that Amorim may just have cobbled together a means to create and score enough goals for United is fading fast.",
      "Mbeumo opened his account with a fine probing dribble and clever finish into the far corner but Cunha missed his penalty to ensure United’s £74m shrinking violet of a No.9 had to take his before Mbeumo missed the crucial one. You really can write it.",
      "The problem in the minds of many is in midfield. Manuel Ugarte again staked his claim in a keenly contested battle to be the worst of all midfield signings made in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era before being hooked at half-time for Bruno Fernandes, which granted us all an ill-fated look at the captain and wantaway Kobbie Mainoo together in the double pivot.",
      "United did improve, but that felt as much to do with an inevitable increase in pressure from a Premier League side over a tiring League Two minnow as evidence of Mainoo-Fernandes being a viable future partnership. Amorim won’t have been convinced the uptick in creativity that did come was significant enough for him to make peace with the soft centre he’s worried about in Premier League games to come.",
      "But maybe it won’t matter for much longer what Amorim thinks. Maybe Mainoo just needs to wait out Amorim, because the image of him with head bowed on the bench as his ragtag bunch of expensively signed footballers got dumped out of a cup competition they’re only playing in at this point because he did such a terrible job last season will be a hard one to shake for the players, the fans and the owners, who may as well pull the trigger now, because if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Amorim’s Manchester United, there’s always a new nadir.",
      "MAILBOX: Ruben Amorim ‘waiting to be sacked’ as Man Utd ‘more Spursy than Spurs’",
      "Amorim insists Grimsby were “the only team on the pitch” as Man Utd were dumped out of the Carabao Cup after losing to the League Two side on penalties.",
      "Manchester United have lost to Grimsby on penalties and it was so hilarious that we had to rush out an extra Mailbox.",
      "We are trying to move on from Liverpool, Newcastle and Alexander Isak but there’s still plenty of that. Man Utd first though…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘accelerate’ for their ‘clear priority’ as Ruben Amorim is ‘raging’ at one Red Devils star.",
      "Wayne Rooney thinks Ruben Amorim now has “no excuses” not to excel this season after the Man Utd board brought in new attacking reinforcements.",
      "Even a truly rotten West Ham are better than Manchester United have been under Ruben Amorim."

      "Chelsea are ‘close to agreeing terms’ with Manchester United over a £40m deal for Alejandro Garnacho in what sounds like quite the deal for the Blues.",
      "United wanted £50m for the Argentinian, but as reported by The Telegraph, Ruben Amorim announcing to the world that there was no way back for Garnacho at Old Trafford ‘gave negotiations a different dynamic’. After Garnacho insisted it was ‘Chelsea or nothing’, BlueCo needed only to wait out United, and the Red Devils have duly wilted.",
      "We said last week amid reports that United would hold out for their asking price that Chelsea should push for much of that fee to be in add-ons, acting as ‘Pr*ck Protection’ in case Garnacho decided to post a picture of himself wearing the shirt of a rival club on social media or flipped the bird to the club’s fans, but Chelsea will consider £40m a more than fair price even given the potential for Garnacho not to kick on at Stamford Bridge.",
      "There’s a question as to whether Chelsea even need him given the arrival of Jamie Gittens this summer, with Pedro Neto and Joao Pedro also options for Enzo Maresca on the left, while the return of Mykhaylo Mudryk remains a possibility, albeit an uninspiring one.",
      "But as Chelsea have shown so impressively in this transfer window, with 12 player sales almost entirely cancelling out their eight arrivals to leave them with a net spend of almost zero, including three only signed last summer, they’re a club which sees footballers as commodities to be bought and sold, with a somewhat depressing lack of emotion involved in their decisions. Garnacho is simply a market opportunity they couldn’t miss out on.",
      "‘Chelsea have made a number of checks on his character and approach to the job, although the acceptance is that the proof will be in his performance’, according to The Telegraph. But a cut-price deal means Chelsea won’t need any improvement from Garnacho to make a tidy profit.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘At the level of the deal as agreed, there is a realistic market for Garnacho beyond Chelsea should it not work out for him in west London. With only a few exceptions, Chelsea’s business is done with potential trading of the player further down the line should a transfer not work out.’",
      "MORE CHELSEA COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Barcelona set Chelsea ultimatum after Blues ‘formal offer’ as two signing conditions revealed\n👉 Chelsea transfer ‘falls through’ as player ‘fails medical’ ahead of agreed controversial move\n👉 Tottenham told to ‘move quickly and quietly’ to sign long-time Chelsea target",
      "Assuming he doesn’t upset the apple cart as he’s done under Ruben Amorim, and maybe even if he does but Chelsea don’t make such a big deal about it, the same return as last season of ten goals and ten assists will result in plenty of interest next summer.",
      "Noni Madueke got ten goals and five assists last season before Arsenal bought him for £48m. Anthony Elanga’s six goals and 12 assists to prompt Newcastle into his £52m signing. And Chelsea themselves signed Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for £48.5m after his 12 goals and five assists. Garnacho got more goal contributions than any of them and arguably has the highest ceiling.",
      "There’s a decent chance Garnacho will thrive at Chelsea – he’s a big talent who’s desperate to play for them – but the price tag offers a very savvy football club a safety net in a transfer which feels as much like a business transaction as a move for a player they’re convinced will make a big difference on the pitch.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working hard to finalise’ a ‘blockbuster £120m double deal’ amid interest from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Former Chelsea fan favourite Conor Gallagher is ‘open’ to a return to the Premier League with Crystal Palace, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United reportedly asked for an evolving Chelsea star in negotiations over the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to the London club.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly given Tottenham the ‘green light’ to come back into the frame for Alejandro Garnacho, as they fear gifting Chelsea a cut-price signing.",
      "Rather than Man Utd and Chelsea meeting in the middle on Garnacho to leave them both £10m unhappy, we propose £20m-worth of ‘Pr*ck Protection’.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘working to finalise the signing’ of Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho amid a ‘discreet offer’."

Leeds have supposedly made an ‘ambitious approach’ (not half), but Mainoo wants to be playing Champions League football. Newcastle can offer that, along with an immediate spot in the team as their No.9 as things stand, and have ‘made contact’ with Manchester United over the conditions of the deal.",

      "",
      "18) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",

      "",
      "15) 🔽 Manuel Akanji – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nThe City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray, while Crystal Palace have also made a play for the veteran, and Bayer Leverkusen could pursue if Piero Hincapie leaves. City are likely to encourage his departure given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay and hasn’t agreed terms with Gala despite a £15m bid being accepted last week. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "14) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay.

Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar amid conflicting reports on whether he would serve as a replacement for the Swede or Callum Wilson. Either way, Newcastle’s desperation is showing as a third ‘offer’ worth £60m is set to be submitted after their £55m bid was rejected on Tuesday.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",

      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first and while Spurs are ‘planning a hijack’, that’ll probably fail.",

      "",
      "7) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano continues to insist that a ‘deal is very advanced’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Yeremy Pino – Villarreal to Crystal Palace\nWanted by Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs over the years, Palace have reportedly agreed terms with the exciting Spaniard as their replacement for Ebere Eze.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, which they appear set to do with a £140m bid ‘ready’.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Bayern Munich \nNot another one! Jackson is the latest striker that Newcastle United could miss out on, with Chelsea in agreement with Bayern Munich over a loan deal for their unwanted forward.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jakub Kiwior – Arsenal to Porto\nThis will open the door for Hincapie’s move to Arsenal, whose woeful ability to sell players will sting them again here. Kiwior has proven himself as a top player, especially against Real Madrid in the Champions League, but it looks like the Gunners will pretty much break even with a £23m sale.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnarumma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal, but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Napoli, meanwhile, have had a breakthrough, with Fabrizio Romano saying a deal is at the ‘final stages’ for Romelu Lukaku’s replacement after former team-mate Scott McTominay got on the blower…",

      "Kobbie Mainoo’s agent briefed that his client was interested in Champions League football, and just a few hours later Real Madrid were interested. Shocker.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £142.59m\nNine first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "2) Arsenal – £254.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudged Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes. Then came Eberechi Eze for another £60m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

      "Amorim is destroying talents\nI have had a long and hard thought about what’s happening at United and still can’t fathom Amorim’s decisions, team selection and tactics but, more so his damaging relationships with players. We have lost the services of talented players directly due to his actions albeit he has been in charge for a short period.",
      "First, we lost Rashford, then Garnacho and now Mainoo may be leaving. Great talents and skills lost to United, especially if the cool and collected Kobbie Mainoo leaves.",
      "Instead of playing Fernandes at his competent position of No. 10 and fielding Mainoo in midfield, he continues to play Fernandes in midfield and keep Mainoo on the bench, very ridiculous indeed. This is not impacting on United only, it is also adversely affecting the performance of Bruno Fernandes himself.",
      "Meanwhile, Chico Obi is wasting his skills and talents, not getting even a few playing minutes. Besides, he signed a natural striker, Sesko, and he continues to keep him on the bench. Why? It is completely illogical and, actually, irresponsible that a club signs a needed striker and not play him, leaving him to warm the bench. This is happening despite the fact that only 3 or so clubs scored fewer goals than United last season. No good coach will do that.",
      "Sight should further not be lost of the fact that his utterances are adversely affecting his relationships with the playing body. The issues are exacerbated by his utterly refusal to make changes. All told, Amorim is a problem at United not a solution. I urge him to be flexible enough to identify and implement changes.",
      "Amorim’s greatest problem is his lack of flexibility which has resulted in his adamant refusal to make changes. No change no progress, a saying which is true for all aspects of human endeavours. The status quo is leading the club closer to relegation than to challenging the top six.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",

      "Can a 3-4-3 work in the Premier League?\nTo butcher a famous quote “I have not come to bury Amorin, nor praise him” because it’s pointless. Firstly, no one of any influence is reading my diatribes (heck I can barely get you folk to read them!) and secondly, I don’t have all the facts. So instead I want to change the approach of the club-specific moaning and ask the collective wisdom of the group, perhaps some of you former players or coaches, … Can the 343 system actually work in the EPL?",
      "I’ve read the books and watched numerous teams who play this system and conclude there are 3 major flaws to it:",
      "1. It is overly reliant upon excellent wing backs. If you try and force players to fill that role (e.g. Dalot) not only do they play badly but the whole formation seems to fall apart.",
      "2. The high press works right up until you play against elite teams who can either play around you or ping the ball into the gaps. The current Barcelona women’s team is a perfect example of beating the press. Although they lost to Arsenal in the CLF, they played them off the park.",
      "3. Without 2 DMs, there is either huge holes in the center of the park or one of the 3 Defenders needs to step up. Currently none of the MUFC back 3 can either step into that space and run with the ball.",
      "Sure Amorim was successful… but in the Portuguese League! Can you name a Portuguese Team outside the top 3? And their mid-table teams have noting like the strength in depth of the EPL, teams such as Brighton, Fulham, etc. Similarly with Conte in Italy.",
      "And maybe it is just Amorim. After all, other than a couple of players (i.e. Dalot, Fernandes, Maguire) everyone is new, and he’s had close to 6 months to get his philosophy across. They can’t be that stupid… Can they?",

      "I had reservations before the season started about forcing Kerkez into the line-up against Bournemouth (his old team, first home game, emotional game, etc.). This week Slot playing Wirtz against Newcastle away is more of the same. It is probably the most physical fixture on the calendar. Also it is a difficult place to play without all the Isak nonsense. Just seems tone deaf.",
      "The whole advantage of having quality depth is to be able to withstand injuries and make small changes to keep a competitive edge. Robertson is still a high quality left back and should be the preferred starter and should have been since matchday 1.",
      "I can’t tell if it is his desire to make this his own team or some other reason, but I’ve not been inspired so far. It is early days but there needs to be some tweaks. Maybe you go three at the back and provide more cover for Konate who looks out of shape in addition to being unfocused. MacAlister coming back will help sure up the midfield, but they won’t win against Arsenal (another emotional game against a title rival) without making some change. Large or small. Great games, but christ almighty I won’t hate a clinical 2-0 win.\nJ",

As far as I’m concerned neither have done anything wrong and, as others have said, this is a negotiation process which may or may not lead to Newcastle selling to Liverpool.",
      "All of the blame should sit squarely on Isak (and/or his agent). By all means indicate internally you would like a transfer, (perhaps even submit a transfer request like the good old days?), but still turn up to training and play for the team that is paying you, as per your contract.

A lot of Liverpool fans try and sit upon the moral high ground, decrying other teams’ approaches to transfers (e.g. Real Madrid & TAA), but Liverpool have demonstrated the exact same approach to undermining other teams, much more so than other clubs in the Big 6.",
      "As an aside, Monday’s match was another instance of Newcastle disgracefully crossing the line with physicality, only this time VAR rightly stepped in to actually ensure they were punished for once. It should be unbelievable that the spineless worm of a referee clearly didn’t care about player welfare and would have been happy for Gordon to remain on the pitch, but this is PGMOL under Howard Webb’s stewardship, where the referees need to be front and centre instead of the actual football.",

Lads, you’ve won two PL titles in 35 years, two!! Maybe wind it in a bit?

      "…To pick up on a couple of points (almost everything) made by Lee in the mailbox.",
      "Open goal to start. ‘How in anyone’s right mind can Liverpool fans ever be slagged off’ – First game of the season, Semenyo racially abused at Anfield.",
      "1) Newcastle supporters booed every single Liverpool player each time they had the ball, not just Ekitike (looks a wonderful player). You must have been to a hostile away game before; Liverpool have had loads in Europe over the years. Also, Ekitike’s off the ball trip on Tonali forced him to leave the field injured. It was the type of shithousery you’d expect to see when you watch the caveman united vs caveman athletic derby. To confirm, Newcastle are in the Champions League this season.",
      "2 ) Liverpool are a wonderful team and play some great football. Up until Gordon got himself red carded (rightfully so), Newcastle also played some nice football too but couldn’t score. When you go down to ten men, you need to change your tactics somewhat. You slow the game down, you focus on trying to win set pieces, this isn’t something Newcastle have invented, teams have done it forever. In fact, Liverpool tried several times to slow the game down, I think the referee had a word with Kerkez about time wasting over a throw in. Oh, and the change of tactic nearly worked. You are going to be very disappointed if you go to each game expecting every team to try and pass Liverpool off the park.",
      "As for being verbally aggressive, grow up, I certainly didn’t imagine VVD shouting in the face of the referee 3 times in the first 20 minutes or Gravenberch’s scissor tackle from behind on Bruno (most fouled player in the top 5 leagues last season) that he was cautioned for.",
      "3) All Isak is guilty of is not honouring the 6 year contract he signed 3 years ago, well that and faking an injury to avoid a preseason tour, making himself unavailable for games, going to train with his former club and posting content onto social media that damages the reputation of his employer (though I’ll let that slide what with the sportswashing and all). Yes, Liverpool is a bigger club, yes, they can pay him more money and yes, he’ll win more playing for them, but until they offer the money that Newcastle are willing to accept, he should at least act like a professional. Same for Wissa and anyone else in that position.",
      "4) If Newcastle were able to spend the way Man City or Chelsea was able to spend, then like it or not, they would be a superpower in waiting. If you can’t see that, then I suggest you give up football commentary and try to get Duncan and the boys back together for a Blue reunion tour. Maybe team up with Simply Red and call yourself Deep Purple.No doubt about it, the management structure within the club has been a disaster this year, not many Newcastle supporters will disagree with that. Staveley leaving, ill health of Darren Eales, Paul Mitchell stepping down and no obvious succession planning has each played a part. Prior to that, it was all going swimmingly.",
      "Quick responses now …\nUpset by a banner – anyone wearing a Suarez t-shirt?\nGet into them – sang it for years, you aren’t special!\nSnarling aggression – anyone get bitten?\nPlayacting – Salah ever won a penalty?\nLost a game at home – 10 men outplaying the champions, no shame in that.\nPicked up a suspension – A deserved one may I add.\nTreatment room overflowing – Nothing new there.\nAll because Liverpool bid for one of our players – More so because of how he’s acted since. Oh, and many fans will read posts like yours and think, f*** those entitled pigs.\nNegotiation is not a crime – Liverpool bid once, it wasn’t enough, bid again and it might be. One bid does not a negotiation make.",
      "Covered the Wissa thing above. If you’re bidding £110 million for something valued at £150 million it is derisory. If you bid £110 million for something valued at, let’s say £120 million, it isn’t. The Saudi’s don’t need your shed, don’t waste your time listing it.",
      "Again, with the booing – We booed every player (and the refs), whether they were born in the 90s, 00s or 10s (???). Do you want opposing fans to applaud your players when they score, again, grow up. Oh, and that’s some take, stating that the things stopping Newcastle becoming one of the footballing elites (whatever that is) is the fans booing, players being too committed in tackles and diving.",

      "– Newcastle playing “verbally aggressive” football. Errrr, what?",
      "– “Snarling aggression” and “turning football into a battlefield” sounds very much like what you can expect at Anfield when a stronger team comes to town. If you cross the line, you get what Anthony Gordon got. As per the rules. Nothing to see here.",
      "– City are “sleeping giants”? After one poor season, and one poor result this season? As you smarmily pointed out Lee, it’s August. Maybe heed your own words.",
      "– Accusing other teams of having a victim complex, only to then describe snatching a 100th-minute win against a team who’d been down to 10 for the previous 70 minutes as “poetic justice”? Jesus Christ. How many advantages do you need before you get down off your cross?",
      "To summarise, creating a hostile atmosphere makes a ground an intolerant hell hole unless it’s Anfield, you’re not allowed ruffle Liverpool players by fair means or foul cos diddums, and the league is sewn up because one bad result for anyone else immediately colours a 38 game season.",

      "I would find out the wonderkids in internet forums down the line and make sure I got a few bargains in a lower league team at the start to give me a boost. I would DEFINITELY rage quit and even if I had to start a few matches back it was still fulfilling to take a lower league team and bring them up into the Champions League with the squad, wonderkinds, youth development regens and some legends who I would sign just to say I managed (looking at you Barca tiki taka legends)",

However, back then I had chosen Finnish KuPS, who were riding high in their domestic league at the time (and are 2nd, at the time of writing, on GD). They were doing great, and after beating Kairat Almaty in the home leg 2-0, it looked like they were all set to almost be there.",
      "Unfortunately the away tie ended 3-0 to Almaty, with all three goals scored in the 1st half. They went into the break needing just a goal, but ultimately they were awful, registering just 1 shot on target, and gaining 2 corners, in stark contrast to the home tie where they had 5 and 10 respectively.",
      "Maybe it had something to do with the travelling to the outer reaches of … checks map … Kazakhstan, a village 200km from China, and has a Wiki page that hasn’t been updated in 8 years. These are the reasons why I do this every year, guys.",
      "Anyhoo, perhaps that distance played a role in their vanquishing of Celtic last night? Kairat managed to take a 0-0 from Scotland back home, and got another in front of their own fans – evidently 300 Celtic fans made the trip – and took it to penalties.",
      "The Kairat keeper was apparently an emergency stop gap, but it was he, Temirlan Anarbekov, at the age of 21, who brought the riches of Champion’s League to this club. The second Kazakh team to feature.",

      "Conor Gallagher (Atletico Madrid)\nThe former Chelsea midfielder was in Tuchel’s last squad, which perfectly illustrates what a dearth of options England still have in central midfield; we’re only just past the point of adding Kalvin Phillips to these features.",
      "Atletico have had a tricky start to this season and Gallagher doubly so, being hauled off at half-time in the opening game and being benched for the second. There have been links with Crystal Palace and he is said to be ‘open’ to the move. It’s hardly surprising…the last time he went to Palace, he was voted Player of the Year and became an England regular.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nThis was supposed to be the summer that Elliott left Liverpool after a season in which he started just two Premier League matches…after the title had been won. And yet there he still is, coming off the bench for a few minutes against Newcastle after spending the entirety of the Bournemouth game waiting for a chance that never came.",
      "There’s no doubt that Elliott could make the breakthrough to the England senior squad if he was playing regular football, and he could be offered that in the Bundesliga, at Tottenham as an alternative to Eberechi Eze, or at Crystal Palace as a replacement for Eze. Could he be the World Cup bolter we predicted?",

And he is exactly the kind of useful defender that international managers love.",
      "It has to hurt Gomez that Dominik Szoboszlai was picked out of position at right-back for the belter with Newcastle United and if he cannot get a look-in past this version of Ibrahima Konate, then his Liverpool career looks doomed.",
      "The good news for Gomez is that half the Premier League will be desperate for last-minute recruits, and a Gomez playing regular mid-table football might sneak onto that plane.",

      "Manchester United players might be planning their exit if picked to start against Grimsby – but Ruben Amorim would welcome a new club-record signing.",
      "For the first time in over a decade, Manchester United have been thrown into the second round of the League Cup draw this season.",
      "It presents a clear opportunity for Amorim to record his first win of the season – and just his 17th in 45 matches in charge.",
      "But Manchester United have been here before: with a tactically rigid manager in his first full season; winless in their opening two Premier League games; with days remaining of the transfer window; and facing the ignominy of some early Carabao because of their lack of European football. And it did not go well.",
      "The 4-0 defeat to League One side MK Dons in August 2014 still stands as one of the most embarrassing since Sir Alex Ferguson left, and really beyond that in the club’s entire history.",
      "Van Gaal, serenaded with chants of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” by the home fans at points throughout, was “not shocked” by the manner or measure of defeat.",
      "He also said “it’s very difficult when you start as manager in the Premier League with a home match loss and after that a draw and then lose a cup match, then for the fans it is very difficult to believe, still believe, in the philosophy of Louis van Gaal. But you have to do that, you have to do that, because I am here to build a new team, and a new team is not built in one month.”",
      "Change the name and that is pretty much verbatim what Amorim will say when Jaze Kabia humbles them at Blundell Park on Wednesday evening.",
      "Van Gaal even pointed to the “process” of having to coach players on a three-at-the-back system. Grimsby are through and whoever starts for the visitors on the coast will be sold imminently.",
      "There are some debatably positive omens. It only added to the hilarity and absurdity of the defeat that earlier in the day Manchester United announced the British record capture of Angel Di Maria, who would thankfully instantly solve all these problems by himself.",
      "The “complete fanny” would likely have wilted at Stadium MK at the sight of Dean Lewington, Kyle McFadzean, Darren Potter and an 18-year-old Dele. This lot most certainly did.",
      "",
      "David de Gea\nThe extent of the damage caused to the starting line-up named on that fateful evening will be laid bare in due course, but De Gea was typically immune to it.",
      "The Spaniard was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and the club’s Player of the Year that campaign, adding either or both honour a few times over during the subsequent eight seasons he spent between the sticks.",
      "And even still he was discarded as easily as a free lunch or actual employee when it came to making and articulating an actual decision on his future when his final contract expired.",
      "",
      "Marnick Vermijl\nAn injury crisis thrust Vermijl into the spotlight, two years after his first Manchester United appearance in a League Cup third-round win over Newcastle.",
      "A player his father once said Sir Alex Ferguson predicted “would become a fixture in the Manchester United squad” in fact did not; those 90 chastening minutes which culminated in his mistake to let Benik Afobe in to score a fourth were his last in the shirt.",
      "Marnick left in a permanent move to Sheffield Wednesday the following winter and is currently having Afobe-related nightmares as a 33-year-old at third-tier Belgian club Thes.",
      "",
      "Michael Keane\nWhile he is sometimes lumped in with those the club were wrong to sell, Keane stood precious little chance at Manchester United after a disastrous performance against League One opposition.",
      "“I feel that when you play for United you don’t get too many chances and when you do you’ve got to take them,” he said a few months later. “But the whole team didn’t perform that day – it wasn’t just one or two players. I was gutted for a few days afterwards and I was really disappointed in myself but I was hopeful I’d get another chance. It didn’t happen.”",
      "Perhaps sensing that opportunities would not be forthcoming after his fifth and final game, Keane sought the safe haven offered by Sean Dyche. A loan move to Burnley was completed within the week and made permanent by the winter.",
      "Manchester United did at least land a sizeable portion of his next transfer through a sell-on fee.",
      "",
      "Jonny Evans\nArguably the worst individual performance on a collectively catastrophic evening came from the captain. Evans owned up to his part of the “sloppy mistakes” and could be found on the scene of all four individual crimes.",
      "“Once we had to start chasing the game their superior fitness levels showed, because most of our team hadn’t played in a while,” he added.",
      "Yet Evans endured, sticking around for another season before leaving and frequently being labelled as a player who “should never have been allowed to leave”.",
      "The MK Dons game was not mentioned in his return announcement almost a decade later.",
      "",
      "Reece James\nNot he of Chelsea fame but the Football League journeyman who is currently holed up at Rotherham, left-back James was given his debut in inauspicious circumstances and never played for the club again.",
      "James had scored twice in a pre-season friendly against LA Galaxy, the first game in charge for Louis van Gaal, but “the MK Dons game killed me and I can only fault myself for that”.",
      "",
      "Saidy Janko\nWhen asked to name the four signings David Moyes made at Manchester United, the universal first answer is Marouane Fellaini. Once the realisation hits that he lasted beyond January, the next guess tends to be Juan Mata. And some might even recall the great Guillermo Varela, who started that ludicrous game against Arsenal in 2016.",
      "Janko is the Sporcle trap, shuffling through the same door as Fellaini on deadline day in summer 2013. And his solitary Manchester United career appearance was cut short as the half-time substitute sacrifice.",
      "“Giggsy said I did well and it was a bit unfortunate,” Janko later claimed while confirmed Van Gaal “didn’t speak to me”. But the Dutchman “was not happy with the formation” and “I was the one who had to go off but at least I got a few minutes”.",
      "And to be fair, Manchester United went from 1-0 down at the break to a 4-0 loss without Janko. He was holding it all together.",
      "",
      "Anderson\nFour Premier League titles, a heroic penalty in the Champions League final and a legendary imbalance of absurd ability and non-existent work rate has ensured that Anderson’s final Manchester United start can be consigned deep to the back of the collective conscience.",
      "But the sight of him struggling to keep track of Will Grigg as the closest central defender to the forward in an apparent three-at-the-back formation did sum up the latter part of his career in particular.",
      "Anderson did play again for Manchester United, also summarily failing to impact a goalless draw with Burnley before heading back to Brazil at just 26.",
      "",
      "Shinji Kagawa\nIt seems likely that Kagawa would be mildly grateful for the concussion he suffered in the opening stages of the game, seeing as it left him with no memory of what would transpire.",
      "Manchester United were still holding MK Dons to a respectable goalless draw when he went off for Adnan Januzaj in what was the sad final appearance of an ultimately regretful spell at Old Trafford. Five days after the defeat he was back at Dortmund.",
      "",
      "Nick Powell\nIt is the personal favourite post-Ferguson moment of many: when Manchester United, 2-1 down and needing to beat Wolfsburg to ensure a place in the Champions League knockouts, introduced Powell for Juan Mata around the hour mark.",
      "Van Gaal’s side did draw level shortly thereafter but Wolfsburg immediately hit back to consign them to the Europa League.",
      "It was Powell’s penultimate Manchester United appearance, and first in 16 months since his hour or so against MK Dons. His teammates were justifiably ‘bemused’ and the media was glowing with righteous indignation too.",
      "",
      "Javier Hernandez\nThere is every reason to believe Van Gaal did tell Hernandez, as the Mexican later recounted, that he “only had a 1% chance of playing in my position”. That is entirely on brand with the manager’s methods.",
      "But that “1% chance” did manifest itself as two starts under the Dutchman, who hauled Hernandez off at half-time of a goalless draw on the opening day with Swansea and let him slug it out for all of the MK Dons embarrassment.",
      "Hernandez found himself on loan at Real Madrid the following week and was gone for good within the year.",
      "",
      "Danny Welbeck\nBut Welbeck is most frequently cited as the one who should never have been allowed to get away.",
      "Van Gaal explained that he had “given all the players a chance to convince me of their qualities” but decided to offload Welbeck to Arsenal “because of Falcao but also the youngsters who can fit in”.",
      "Gary Neville, Jose Mourinho and Rio Ferdinand seem to take it in turns questioning why Welbeck was sold every six months and the player himself presumably felt the League Cup second round graveyard shift was an affront too far.",
      "Welbeck never started again, made a cameo in the goalless draw with Burnley days later and joined Arsenal before the window closed.",
      "In a nutshell, expect an uninterested starting line-up featuring Andre Onana, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo to get battered before they are offloaded the following day.",
      "READ NEXT: Real Madrid ‘monitoring’ Man Utd star amid Amorim ‘tipping point’ and ‘exacerbated issue’",

      "Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, according to reports.",
      "Mainoo has been an unused substitute in the Red Devils’ opening two Premier League matches, sparking debate over his future at the club.",
      "Ruben Amorim has come under intense scrutiny for ignoring the 20-year-old in the defeat to Arsenal and draw at Fulham.",
      "In the Fulham game, the 40-year-old brought on defenders Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven in the closing stages instead of turning to Mainoo.",
      "Having come through the United academy, the England international is a fan favourite at Old Trafford, and supporters are firmly opposed to the idea of him being sold.",
      "United haven’t made a decision on Mainoo’s future but have reportedly been ‘contacted’ by several clubs after it emerged that he is open to a fresh challenge.",
      "There’s plenty of football to be played, however, and two consecutive games on the bench don’t necessarily mean Mainoo is out of Amorim’s plans.",
      "Still, it’s an ominous sign that the Portuguese head coach has continued to prefer a struggling Manuel Ugarte and attacking midfielder Mason Mount in his midfield two.",
      "Amorim’s reason for Mainoo’s lack of minutes is that he’s competing with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot.",
      "Fernandes is virtually undroppable, and if Amorim sees it as a straight choice between him and Mainoo, the youngster may feel he has little option but to leave.",
      "A previous report from Daily Mail journalist Chris Wheeler did not name the clubs exploring a move for Mainoo, but did say there are as many as ten teams interested in the ‘frustrated’ star.",
      "Now, a fresh report from Wheeler’s colleague Mike Keegan says the two Madrid giants are keen.",
      "There are apparently ‘a host of Premier League clubs monitoring the situation’, while Atletico and Real Madrid are ‘keeping tabs’.",
      "The two La Liga clubs are ‘interested’ in agreeing a season-long loan for Mainoo, who is ‘open to remaining at United’, though his desire is to play first-team football regularly and is also willing to join a club in the Champions League.",
      "The report adds:",
      "It is thought unlikely that United would sanction a loan switch for a player who they are not actively seeking to sell.",
      "The club currently only have four central midfielders and anything other than a permanent move for Mainoo is not desirable.",
      "Given the season is only two matches old, the player may well have a key part to play at Old Trafford, despite his early absence from the line-up.",
      "He is not thought to fit Amorim’s 3-4-3 system and his absence from the first XI appears to have brought things to a tipping point.",

      "Premier League clubs (excluding Fulham) have used the transfer window to upgrade certain positions, but who are the 10 biggest upgrades? Here’s our ranking…",
      "",
      "10) Jacob Murphy to Anthony Elanga (Newcastle United)\nMurphy’s Premier League numbers last season were more than respectable (eight goals, 12 assists), but nobody really believes those numbers are sustainable. Newcastle clearly don’t, which is why they moved for Elanga.",
      "The Swede’s blistering pace already makes him one of the most dangerous wingers in the division, and while Murphy impressed in 2024/25, he’s not the long-term answer on the right. Once Elanga settles, he should become a genuine asset and goal threat, and Murphy will be back in his more natural role as a handy back-up.",
      "",
      "9) Fabian Schar to Malick Thiaw (Newcastle United)\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe is known for taking his time with new signings, so Schar’s long-term replacement might not get the nod immediately. But when Thiaw does settle, it’ll be for good – until he inevitably joins Liverpool in 2028.",
      "Thiaw is one of the few Newcastle summer targets who actually wanted to join and could form a top-class partnership with Sven Botman if he gets back to the 2022/23 levels that first caught the eye. Schar’s been a great servant, but this is the beginning of the end.",
      "",
      "8) Manchester United bomb squad to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\nIt’s a definite upgrade on Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. But let’s be honest: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo looked sharp on debut against Arsenal, constantly troubling the Gunners’ defence, but couldn’t find a way past David Raya. There’s plenty to like about them, yet history tells us even world-class players have crumbled at Old Trafford. Proceed with cautious optimism.",
      "",
      "7) Robin Olsen to Marco Bizot (Aston Villa)\nThis is a monumental upgrade on one of the weakest back-up goalkeepers in the division, perhaps the biggest on this list. But it is a back-up goalkeeper so we’re not moved enough to put this one any higher.",
      "Bizot kept a clean sheet on his Villa debut against Newcastle and looked very confident, which makes supporters more confident and, more importantly, those in front of him on the grass.",
      "Not only has Unai Emery improved in the goalkeeper department, but he’s added a No.2 capable of usurping Emi Martinez, or at least stepping in if the two-time Yashin Trophy winner gets the summer move he expected back in May.",
      "",
      "6) Illan Meslier to Lucas Perri (Leeds United)\nLeeds fans hailed this as a huge upgrade before even seeing Perri in their shirt — Meslier was that bad. Last season’s calamities, including his horror show against Sunderland, meant Daniel Farke had no choice but to drop him for Karl Darlow during the promotion run-in.",
      "Perri conceded five against Arsenal but showed enough presence to settle any nerves. And after watching Meslier flap at crosses like a malfunctioning wind turbine, that’s already a win.",
      "",
      "5) Darwin Nunez to Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nEkitike has announced himself quickly at Liverpool, scoring and assisting in the 4-2 win against Bournemouth, before netting at Newcastle and after bagging in the Community Shield. Concerns about Bundesliga tax and his PSG struggles now look a little overblown.",
      "Tall, quick and technically slick, he looks absolutely fantastic. And unlike Nunez, he doesn’t spend half the game looking like he’s tripping over his own shoelaces.",
      "",
      "4) Ilkay Gundogan to Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nWhat a debut. Reijnders looked right at home pulling Wolves apart, and it’s already hard to imagine City without him. His ball-carrying, creativity and eye for goal make him the perfect heir to Gundogan.",
      "The German’s second stint in Manchester has been underwhelming, but if Reijnders can chip in with big goals like Gundogan once did, he’ll be a hero in no time. This is a proper City signing: seamless, smart, and slightly terrifying for everyone else.",
      "",
      "3) Dan Neil to Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nNo disrespect to Neil — he didn’t need replacing — but when a player of Xhaka’s calibre becomes available, you don’t say no.",
      "He’s walked straight in as captain, which tells you everything. The risk, of course, is that Sunderland get the Xhaka who blows up and tells the fans where to go. But if they get the Xhaka of the last three years, the Black Cats have every chance of staying up.",
      "",
      "2) Kai Havertz/Mikel Merino/Gabriel Jesus to Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nIt was tempting to label this ‘Whoever to Gyokeres’ given how muddled Arsenal’s striker options were; Havertz, Merino and Jesus all had turns, and signing a new centre-forward was the club’s biggest priority going into the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres scored a brace on his home debut to avoid the dreaded early drought and shock kick on from here.",
      "",
      "1) Jack Harrison to Jack Grealish (Everton)\nIt took about 90 minutes for Grealish to remind everyone what he can do, assisting both goals in Everton’s 2-0 win over Brighton.",
      "Is he strictly an upgrade on Harrison? Maybe not — but in one start he matched Harrison’s 38-game tally for goal involvements last season. For David Moyes, for Everton, and possibly for England in a World Cup year, this could be the transfer that gets Grealish’s career back on track.",

      "Commenting on Rashford’s performance in the 45 minutes he got, Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told Premier Sports: “At half time I think the experiment finished.”",
      "Before adding: “I think his teammates need to help him, the team was a little slow with [Marc] Casado in the middle, so when he had the ball he only really had the chance to do his thing which he did a couple of times when his explosive pace helped him to create a chance which he had that was well saved.",

      "Premier League spending has reached an all-time high in this summer's transfer window; net-spend figures show the extent to which Man Utd and Arsenal have strengthened their attacks while Bournemouth's defence looks weakened",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Jim Lethem",
      "Wednesday 27 August 2025 16:30, UK",
      "Premier League clubs have set a new record for spending in a single transfer window this summer at over £2.6bn.",
      "Arsenal's signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace saw the previous record fall with a week of the window still to go.",
      "But how has the money been spent? Using net-spend figures, this week's Between the Lines looks at the positions in which clubs have strengthened this summer - and where they have got weaker.",
      "Nearly half of the £2.6bn spent this summer has gone on forwards. At a whopping £1.4bn, Premier League clubs have splurged roughly £850m more on forward players than on players in any other position, with defenders next on £547m.",
      "The figures highlight the huge value placed on attacking players, particularly in a summer when many of the Premier League's top clubs have been looking to add more firepower.",
      "The most high-profile movers include Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, Benjamin Sesko, Viktor Gyokeres and Joao Pedro. But with the Alexander Isak saga rumbling on, the total could soar even higher before Monday's transfer deadline.",
      "Net spend, which factors money received in sales, adds another layer of insight and underlines the scale of the investment made by some of the Premier League's elite sides.",
      "Manchester United sit top, having added Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha as well as Sesko for £207.5m combined. Marcus Rashford has left on loan to Barcelona, but they are yet to offset that spending by selling any of their existing options permanently.",
      "Arsenal are not far behind them for net spend on forwards, with Eze following Noni Madueke and Gyokeres to the club at a combined cost of £180.5m before having made any sales.",
      "Chelsea have also spent heavily, with Joao Pedro one of four attacking signings, but the sales of Madueke, Joao Felix and Armando Broja have helped reduce their net spend to £55m.",
      "While some clubs have bolstered their attacks, others have taken a hit - none more so than Crystal Palace, whose frontline is £67.5m lighter after Eze's move to Arsenal.",
      "Meanwhile, West Ham have made a net profit of £55m on forwards, having not yet replaced Mohammed Kudus, who joined Spurs for £55m, leaving them light in their front line.",
      "Further investment may also be needed at Brighton, Brentford and Wolves, who are ostensibly weaker in attack, with negative net spends, having lost Joao Pedro, Cunha and Mbeumo, respectively.",
      "Moving on to midfield and, following the signings of Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard and no sales, Arsenal come out top for net spend on £66m as things stand.",
      "Much of the focus is on Mikel Arteta's attack following their investment this summer but their midfield has also been significantly reinforced, with Zubimendi going straight into the starting line-up following his £51m arrival from Real Sociedad.",
      "Everton and Sunderland are next highest for net spend on midfielders. The Toffees have added Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and Charly Alcaraz without losing anyone, while the promoted Black Cats have signed Enzo Le Fee, Granit Xhaka and Habib Diarra to offset the sale of Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Along with Chelsea, Aston Villa currently have a notable negative net spend on midfielders, owing to the £43m sale of Jacob Ramsey to Newcastle. The club are yet to replace the 24-year-old, or bring in any bodies in midfield, leaving Unai Emery with fewer options than last season.",
      "Bournemouth stand out for net spend on defenders. Having lost three members of their first-choice back four last season in Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez for fees worth a combined £144.5m, they are in profit to the tune of £98m.",
      "Replacements have so far been recruited for lower costs, with centre-back Bafode Diakite joining from Lille for £35m and left-back Adrien Truffert arriving from Rennes for £14.4m. Their strong starts show there is value to be found in the market, as Bournemouth previously showed with Huijsen, Zabarnyi and Kerkez.",
      "Andoni Iraola will, however, need more backing defensively. They are still down a body at centre-back. But the club will aim to find the requisite quality while remaining in profit.",
      "It may seem hard to believe on the back of their 5-1 thrashing by Chelsea, and their subsequent 3-2 loss to Wolves in the Carabao Cup, but the side to have strengthened their defence most, in terms of net spend, is West Ham, who have signed Jean-Clair Todibo following his loan spell for £35m and also added full-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.",
      "Liverpool currently have the second-highest net spend on defenders, with Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giovanni Leoni arriving after Real Madrid paid £10m for Trent Alexander-Arnold, and Jarell Quansah left for Bayer Leverkusen for £35m.",
      "But their figure could rise further if they add another centre-back, with Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi still a possibility.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Manchester City are the biggest net spenders on goalkeepers so far having re-signed James Trafford for £31m, and there could be more activity as there is uncertainty around the future of Ederson amid links with Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "By selling Trafford to his boyhood club, Burnley are at the other end of the net spend on goalkeepers table, with Martin Dubravka and Max Weiss arriving for much lower fees, leaving them weakened in the position on paper."

      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",
      "\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.",
      "\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",
      "\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",
      "For the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.",
      "The Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.",
      "\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"",
      "Neville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.",
      "\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.",
      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.",
      "\"I think he let it impact him,\" said Neville. \"I thought he let it get to him. When he came out for the second half, he was still talking to the referee.",
      "\"I know that can happen, but I think you can see in his face sometimes with Bruno that he wears his heart on his sleeve and it was quite clear that obviously he's desperately disappointed about missing the penalty in the way in which he did.",
      "\"Sometimes, if a goalkeeper saves it you might think, 'OK, that happened', but he's smashed it over the bar, and then there was this idea that the referee disrupted his rhythm.",
      "\"It was a complete accident. Obviously the referee was trying to walk back towards the players coming in.",
      "\"He just seemed to let it impact him in the game and I think that's just something that shouldn't have happened really, but that wasn't the biggest problem out there for United today.\"",
