      "Ferdinand, 46, posted on social media platform X: \"Gutted to be missing the Semi-Finals this week on @footballontnt!! Wishing the team all the best - I'll be watching every minute from the iPad!\"",
      "Arsenal are in Paris for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, trailing PSG 1-0 on aggregate after suffering a narrow defeat at the Emirates last week. United, meanwhile, resume their tie with Bilbao boasting a 3-0 advantage, having enjoyed a comfortable win in the first leg.",
      "Ferdinand is a staple of TNT's football coverage but won't be at the Parc des Princes nor Old Trafford. The broadcaster has the TV rights to both matches as well as the games involving Tottenham and Chelsea on Thursday.",
      "Fans wished him the best, with TNT's X account saying: \"Get well soon, Rio.\" Another said: \"Wishing you a speedy recovery.\" A third followed-up with: \"Get well soon and don't worry. The champions league final will be between PSG vs Inter Milan. I know you'll be there in Munich.\"",
      "Inter Milan are the opponents awaiting either PSG or Arsenal after overcoming Barcelona on Tuesday in extra-time. With the scoreline in their favour and home advantage, the Parisians are the favourites to go through.",
      "Previewing the second leg on his podcast, Ferdinand said: \"If there is a team who can go to PSG and win, it's Arsenal. I don't think it's about ability at this stage, I think it's about mentality and belief.",
      "\"In Bukayo Saka they've got a matchwinner who can turn the game on its head. There's positives there but if the mindset isn't right, they will get smoked, I'm telling you. The problem for Arsenal is PSG are a proper team, I don't think they're invincible but they've been the best team in the Champions League.\"",
      "Who'll reach the final - Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "The ex-England defender, speaking before Barcelona were eliminated after an all-time classic semi-final, added: \"If you're a football purist, you want the two most attacking and free teams in the final. PSG and Barcelona are the two most attacking and free teams in terms of letting their attacking players just go.",
      "\"I think that would make for an unbelievable spectacle and throw us into a different cycle where managers attack more. Luis Enrique and Hansi Flick could be the managers to follow in terms of their philosophy instead of Pep Guardiola who has been great at it in a great era.\""

      "Ruben Amorim admits he does not know which version of his Manchester United team will show up on Thursday night. But the United boss knows whichever one does, they are going to suffer in their make-or-break Europa League semi-final tie with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Even though United hold a 3-0 lead from the first leg, where they played for an hour against 10 men, Amorim knows he cannot take anything for granted, given his side's erratic form. United have conceded three times or more at Old Trafford on six different occasions this season, which is why Amorim is understandably reluctant to believe the tie is all but won.",
      "Asked if he was unsure which United side will turn up tonight, Amorim was blunt and said: \"Yeah, it’s hard to say. Sometimes, it’s not what kind of team we will be tomorrow.",
      "\"If you look at our team, we cannot say today what is going to happen. There are some teams in any league that can understand that the game is going to be like this.",
      "“Things can change a little bit, but the story is going to be like this and we can control the narrative of the game. We cannot do that.",
      "“So we have to face the game as just one more game. I feel that we need to score to go to the next round, so that's clearly the way we are going to face the game.",
      "“Against Brentford, we were near to getting the draw, but we suffered a goal and suffered another goal, quite fast. That can happen. That has happened four times here, so we know we will have to suffer a little bit to go to the final, and we are ready to suffer and we need to better at the small details in this game.\"",
      "Amorim revealed he has only watched back the first 30 minutes of the first leg, in which United were under pressure and came close to conceding several times, to ensure he and his players do not repeat that shaky opening tonight. \"I watched the first 30 minutes a lot of times and I forgot the rest,” said Amorim. “You cannot prepare for a game with 11 against 10, with a 2-0 lead at that moment.",
      "“So, I watched the first 30 minutes back and I had the feeling again that they were really intense, but that most of the opportunities were a little bit our fault, that we had lost possession. It was hard to find some place where they built up from the defence, the midfielders, the forwards and then created the chances. It was more like we had the ball, we lost the ball and we had problems.",
      "“So we watched it quite a few times and showed the players the simple moments, to show why we had so many problems in the first 30 minutes.\"",
      "This is already United's worst season of the Premier League era, down in 15th place after 16 defeats. A few months ago, Amorim admitted this could be the worst side in United's history - even if they win the Europa League and secure Champions League football for next season.",
      "“In that moment - and if you look at the Premier League since I arrived - we are the worst team in terms of results,” said Amorim. “At the end of this season, we can be the worst United team in Premier League history - one with a European title. But that will change nothing.",
      "“We know that this season was really disappointing for everybody, so nothing is going to change that. This season was the worst one - I don’t know if in history - but, for sure, in the last 50 years.\""

      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing an ambitious swap deal that could see them land two high-profile players who rejected Arsenal. With Juventus showing interest in Rasmus Hojlund, United are exploring several different options ahead of what's set to be a crucial summer for the club.",
      "According to Tuttosport, Juventus are open to offering both Dusan Vlahovic and Douglas Luiz in exchange for Hojlund, as they look to offload players to reshape their squad.",
      "Vlahovic famously snubbed Arsenal in favour of a £70million move to Turin in 2022, but his time in Italy could be coming to a close. With just over a year remaining on his contract, Juventus are eager to find a buyer to avoid losing him for free in 2026.",
      "Despite scoring 55 goals in 140 appearances for the Italian giants, Vlahovic, 25, has come under scrutiny for his inconsistency and inability to deliver in big games. His nine-goal return in Serie A this season, coupled with his eye-watering £317,000-per-week wages, has left Juve's hierarchy looking for a way out.",
      "Luiz, meanwhile, has struggled to cement a place in the Juventus starting XI since his £43m switch from Aston Villa last year. The Brazilian midfielder, 26, was once the subject of multiple deadline-day bids from Arsenal and has long been on the radar of Premier League clubs. Manchester City were linked with him as recently as January, but he could now end up across town at Old Trafford.",
      "With manager Ruben Amorim preparing for his first full season, United are expected to reinforce across the pitch. Midfield is a particular area of focus, and Luiz is seen as a player who could add energy and tenacity to the centre of the park.",
      "However, any move may depend on Juventus following through on their interest in Hojlund. The Danish forward has endured a difficult spell at Old Trafford, struggling to justify his £72m price tag since arriving from Atalanta in 2023.",
      "However, his prior success in Serie A ensures he remains a coveted asset in Italy, and Juve - in need of a Vlahovic replacement - are considering a swoop, particularly since Hojlund looks to be on the fringes of Amorim's current plans.",
      "Reports suggest Juventus are willing to part with both Vlahovic and Luiz to bring Hojlund to Turin. But whether this proposal aligns with United's priorities remains to be seen.",
      "The club's financial situation remains delicate, and a straight cash injection might be more appealing as they look to balance the books. That said, if Hojlund does leave this summer, United will need to replace him - and Vlahovic offers proven European pedigree at a potentially reduced cost.",
      "There is, however, the issue of Vlahovic's salary. With only three United players currently earning more than £200,000 a week, the former Fiorentina star would likely need to accept a significant pay cut to make the move viable.",
      "Nevertheless, the deal has the potential to be both shrewd and transformative - the kind of calculated risk United may need to take after a dismal campaign they can't afford to repeat."

      "Brooklyn's noticeable no-show at David's extravagant 50th birthday festivities earlier this month, combined with persistent family discord, has shone a harsh light on their fractured bond. To grasp how things got to this point, it's worth looking back to a critical turning point: when Brooklyn chose to walk away from football.",
      "This was an emotional moment that deeply impacted David and exposed the complicated layers of their bond.",
      "In 2014, Brooklyn, then just 15, decided to step away from football, even though he was in Arsenal's youth academy at the time. David, an international sporting icon and Manchester United legend, had long envisioned his son following in his footsteps.",
      "But Brooklyn, now 26, decided to carve out an entirely different identity for himself – pursuing photography, fashion, and entrepreneurship. In a 2015 interview with ABC, David claimed that it \"broke his heart\" to discover Brooklyn had been weighed down by the pressure of his famous surname.",
      "\"One of my boys turned around to me the other day and said, 'Daddy, I'm not sure I want to play football all the time,'\" David said. \"It broke my heart a little bit. He said, 'Every time I step on to the field, I know people are saying, 'This is David Beckham's son,' and if I am not as good as you, then it is not good enough.'\"",
      "Speaking to Variety in 2022, Brooklyn admitted that while quitting football made him \"sad,\" his father ultimately supported him. \"My dad wasn't sad, because he was like, 'I just want you to be happy,'\" Brooklyn said. \"But of course, I was sad. It was my whole life since I was literally two.\"",
      "This moment highlighted David's true nature – not as a controlling parent demanding his child fulfil inherited dreams, but as someone genuinely trying to respect Brooklyn's individuality.",
      "Brooklyn later opened up about his struggles with anxiety and the immense burden of expectations. He said he \"never really enjoyed\" the game, in part due to harsh scrutiny from coaches who expected him to emulate his dad's legendary career.",
      "That immense pressure turned football from a passion into a source of distress. Though it hurt, David acknowledged his son's right to choose a different path. But what once appeared as mutual respect may have slowly evolved into emotional estrangement.",
      "Now, in 2025, the Beckham family is mired in an ongoing feud. Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz skipped all of David's milestone birthday events – including an elegant Miami soiree, a countryside gathering in the Cotswolds, and a glitzy affair at the Met Gala in London.",
      "Insiders say Brooklyn avoided the celebrations due to underlying tensions linked to Nicola, who some insiders blame for worsening the family fallout. One report claims Brooklyn asked for a separate celebration without Romeo's partner, Kim Turnbull, with whom Brooklyn reportedly shares a complicated history.",
      "David declined, emphasising the importance of celebrating as a full family. That refusal apparently hurt Brooklyn, who chose to forgo the events entirely – a decision that has left both David and Victoria hurt.",
      "Tensions have been building since Brooklyn and Nicola's 2022 wedding, which was reportedly marred by disagreements and miscommunications with Victoria. While the two sides made brief strides toward healing, that progress appears to have reversed.",
      "Brooklyn's continued absence from major family events, including Victoria's 51st birthday in April, and the silence around his wedding anniversary have only deepened public suspicions of estrangement.",
      "David appeared to extend an olive branch with a birthday post captioned: \"You were missed @brooklynbeckham\". But Brooklyn's decision to prioritise Nicola and sidestep family moments has seemingly intensified the emotional distance, leaving the family torn and adrift."

      "The seeds of Manchester United's current crisis were ultimately sown 20 years ago, when the Glazer family gained control of the club. Under two decades of ownership under the Glazers, United have gone from being debt-free to owing around £1billion, according to their latest financial results.",
      "On May 12, 2005, Irish racing magnates John Magnier and JP McManus sold their 28.89 per cent stake in United to Florida-based businessman Malcolm Glazer. There were already concerns at United over the leveraged nature of the Glazer takeover, but nothing could prepare fans for what was to come under the family's controversial ownership.",
      "Magnier and McManus famously fell out with Sir Alex Ferguson over the stud rights to the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, with the grubby dispute, played out in public, ultimately leading to the Glazers owning United. With the shareholding from Magnier and McManus, the Glazers controlled 76.2 percent of United and delisted the company in June 2005, beginning two decades of the most toxic club ownership in the history of English football.",
      "Since then, the Glazer family are estimated to have made £1billion from United to line their own pockets, with the club paying out the same amount in interest to facilitate their controversial leveraged buy-out of the club. Despite sustained protests and demonstrations from United fans over the past 20 years, the Glazers remain in overall control of the club, hated by the club's supporters as much now as when they took over.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team may be in charge of football operations at United, having acquired a 28 per cent stake in the club, but the Glazers remain in overall control, despite the best efforts of fans to oust them. Put simply, the Glazers – who profess to love United despite rarely attending games and having almost zero dialogue with the fans – are making too much money from one of the world's biggest clubs to walk away.",
      "Steve Crompton, from The 1958, a United fan group which continues to organise protest marches and demonstrations against the Glazers, said the campaign to rid them from the club will carry on until they achieve that goal.",
      "“The Glazers have drained this club of millions,” said Crompton. “They’ve ripped the heart out of Manchester United and divided the fan base. Two decades ago, they pushed away a loyal section of supporters — and they never came back.",
      "“For 20 years, they’ve bled the club dry, taking dividends while the team and the stadium have been left to rot. We need a new stadium because they’ve neglected Old Trafford for two whole decades. They don’t care about the club. We do.",
      "“United fans love this club — and we hate the Glazers. They’ve poisoned the atmosphere, corrupted the identity, and infected this once-great institution with a toxicity that won’t begin to heal until they’re gone. That’s why, after 20 years, we’re still fighting. And we won’t stop until this toxic ownership is history. Not today, not ever.”",
      "Journalist Chris Blackhurst, whose book, The World’s Biggest Cash Machine , looks at the Glazer ownership of United, said they will stay put as long as the revenue streams keep pouring in, but suggested they could sell if the revenue streams dry up.",
      "“If you talk to the fans, they will say that the Glazers don't love the club,” said Blackhurst. “You hear Joel Glazer has an office that's a shrine to United and whenever they play, everything in Glazerland stops. That may be true, but he's never shown it.",
      "“They don't go to matches, they don't communicate and now it's too late. Sir Jim Ratcliffe was seen as a white knight, this saviour coming in, but now he's got to watch that he's not just become a patsy for the Glazers.",
      "“If you look at all the coverage since Ratcliffe came in, it's all about him – the Glazers are hardly mentioned, yet they're still the majority owners and still in control.",
      "“The crucial thing for the Glazers is the amount of commercial sponsorship coming in. If that dips, and with it United's global reach on social media and the TV audiences, they may consider their options.”"

      "Arsene Wenger has suggested a major reform of football's offside rule could come as soon as next year. The legendary Arsenal boss has long been a chief proponent of making a change and it is now on the agenda.",
      "Wenger, now FIFA's chief of global football development, hopes to introduce a 'daylight' principle to offsides. A player would be deemed as onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is behind or level with the relevant defender.",
      "The idea was first proposed as early as 2020 and after positive trials in Sweden, Italy and the Netherlands and Wenger has hoped to push forward quickly with changes through the International FA Board (IFAB).",
      "And there seems to have been some acceleration to Wenger's bid to fix the issues around offside decisions, with a possible judgement coming next year. Speaking on beIN Sports, Wenger said: \"In 1990 it was decided that it's not offside if you're on the same line as the defender and the striker has advantage if there was doubt.",
      "\"With VAR, this advantage disappeared. I think in England they cancelled 37 goals on marginal offsides, it's very frustrating. It's why I proposed that as long as you're on the same line, you're not offside. In one year the decision will be made by IFAB, not by me.\"",
      "Wenger has proven an open book in his thoughts on football in recent weeks. The Frenchman may have caused uproar in some areas of Manchester and London as he suggested it is 'not right' that the winner of the Europa League is rewarded with a place in the Champions League.",
      "Manchester United and Tottenham are both in advantageous positions to make the competition's finale and the Premier League could find itself with an additional spot in the Champions League. UEFA made the decision to offer a place in the competition as a reward for victory in the Europa League back in 2014",
      "Wenger has called for that to be reviewed, and believes the policy is unfair. Asked for his position, he said. \"No - they should qualify automatically for the Europa League again but not necessarily for the Champions League.",

      "As it stands, despite United and Spurs both being in the bottom half of the Premier League, they could win a place in Europe's top competition. Four teams in the league usually qualify but the Premier League have won an extra spot due to the collective performance of English teams in Europe.",

      "Former Manchester United ace James Wilson has been released by Northampton Town. The 29-year-old, once touted by Louis van Gaal to have the potential to succeed Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie at Old Trafford, finds himself looking for new club after the end of the League One season.",
      "Wilson broke onto the scene by making an emphatic impact on his United debut. Playing under Ryan Giggs in the final home match of the 2013/14 season, the then 18-year-old bagged a brace to introduce himself to Red Devils fans to dramatic effect.",
      "\"You have seen a little glimpse of the future,\" Giggs told fans after the match. \"This is what this club is about. We never stand still. We give youth a chance as we try and play attractive football.\"",
      "\"He is a natural goalscorer but he has got more to his game than that,\" Giggs said of Wilson. \"He can run at people, he has got pace and he is a clever player.\"",
      "Despite earning 20 appearances in his United career, Wilson failed to make the cut with the 13-times Premier League champions. After loans Brighton, Derby and Sheffield United, a loan spell to Aberdeen became a permanent one.",
      "Following his time in Scotland, Wilson has had spells with Salford City and Port Vale. The striker then completed a move to Northampton Town ahead of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Wilson signed a one-year deal with the option of a further 12 months but failed to hit the heights for the Cobblers. The former Old Trafford prospect failed to score in 12 appearances for the club and has been released.",
      "He was one of 11 players to see their time with Northampton end. Manager Kevin Nolan reflected on the decisions as Tyler Magloire, Jack Sowerby, Nik Tzanev, Ali Koiki, Liam McCarron, Harvey Lintott, Akin Odimayo, Will Hondermarck, TJ Eyoma and Reuben Wyatt all exited after a 19th-place finish.",
      "\"We have made some difficult decisions and it is never nice having to tell a player that their contract is not being renewed,\" he said.",
      "\"Some of these players have been at the club a number of years and have played a big part here, helping the club enjoy some good times over the last few years, and all of the departing players will leave with our thanks and best wishes.",
      "\"We believe we have a good core of players here, both in terms of ability and culture, which is very important, and we are excited to be entering into discussions with our chosen targets to build on and add to that over the course of the summer.\""

Both Friday night games were initially set to take place alongside other Premier League matches on Sunday April 18.",
      "And Villa’s director of football operations Damien Vidagany outlined their unhappiness in a post on social media. “Fixture changed and, honestly, not happy,” he wrote. “We really pushed to protect our fans (our main task and duty) and keep the Spurs match on Sunday. Nothing against Spurs.",
      "\"Considering the alternatives, (much worse on the Wednesday or Thursday) and the process conducted the final outcome is less damaging. At the end, it is what it is.",

      "\"Cleverley stabilised performances at the end of the 2023/24 season in an interim position before his full-time appointment last summer. At one stage, the Golden Boys were part of the play-off picture but, unfortunately, performances and results drifted with just five wins in 2025.\"",

He deserves to be recognised for this and I’m sure he will have a bright future in the game. Tom will always be part of Watford in recognition of all that he has achieved over so many years.”",
      "Cleverley, 35, has been at Watford since 2017 after making a loan move from Everton. He made that switch permanent, eventually making just under 150 appearances for the Herfordshire outfit.",
      "He was named as interim head coach in March 2024 and was handed the permanent role after just one defeat in seven matches. He had penned a deal until the summer of 2027.",
      "Cleverely had Watford challenging for the playoff positions earlier this season but just one win in their last eight matches of the campaign saw their promotion hopes fade rapidly.",
      "Watford eventually finished 14th in the Championship, with the club's controversial owners opting for a change. The Pozzo family have made 20 managerial changes alone in the 13 years they have been at Vicarage Road, while five men have been in the dugout since the Hornets were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the 2021/22 season.",

      "United rejected a bid of around £40million from Napoli for Garnacho in the winter transfer window and Chelsea also expressed interest in the winger. The 20-year-old has started the past 13 United games and flanked Amorim at United's pre-match press conference ahead of their Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "During his first media engagement with the British press, Garnacho expressed his happiness at United. \"As a footballer, you are always going to listen and hear some rumours about the future. But I have a contract here until 2028 so I’m happy here.\"",
      "When asked about Fernandes' future, Amorim said: \"I think it’s easy to understand that (there is interest in Fernandes). Not just because of the numbers, but the way he plays.",
      "\"The importance he has had during his five years here, he’s a top player, we need top players, he’s the leader. He’s the captain, he’s important.",
      "\"It’s normal a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like Garnacho, but we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world. Our idea didn’t change, we want Bruno here.\"",
      "Garnacho admitted his first weeks working with Amorim were \"difficult\". Amorim started work as United manager on November 11 and he omitted Garnacho from the Manchester derby squad at City on December 15.",
      "Amorim dropped Garnacho and Marcus Rashford on account of their attitude and Garnacho has since been included in every United matchday squad whereas Rashford did not play for the club again before he joined Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Garnacho has had to adapt to a playmaker role in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system even though he was developed as a winger in the United academy. \"I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,\" Garnancho explained. \"But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "\"Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",

      "Garnacho has generated comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo due to the similarity of their development at the same age at United. Garnacho is a goal shy of matching the 27 Ronaldo tallied in his first three seasons with United between 2003-06.",
      "\"I’m not focused on the numbers,\" Garnacho stressed. \"I think when Cristiano played here he's a different footballer and different types of games, I just try to help the team and win games.",
      "\"Obviously, missing chances, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus (Hojlund), all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and trying to do better.\"",
      "Hojlund has berated Garnacho a number of times this term over his decision-making in the final third. Garnacho insisted that the pair's rapport is collegiate.",
      "\"I speak with him a lot, we try to help each other but sometimes from this side it’s difficult,\" Garnacho added. \"We train hard every game to try to score more and the team will improve if we score more goals.\""

      "The woeful form of the three promoted sides has ensured that is a fate they have escaped but Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Brentford was the 16th loss of the season in 35 Premier League games and United sit 15th in the table.",
      "Their form in Europe has been a dramatic contrast. Their 3-0 win in Bilbao last week giving them a handy advantage over Athletic Club in the Europa League semi-final and they remain unbeaten in 13 games in this competition this season.",
      "Barring disaster at Old Trafford on Thursday, they will return to Bilbao for the Europa League final on May 21, when victory will deliver not only a European trophy, but a route back into the Champions League, not that that will change Amorim's views on a disappointing season.",
      "\"I think you have to see the quote in the moment, so things can change. For me, in that moment, if you look at the Premier League I think since I arrived we are the worst team in terms of results in Premier League,\" he said.",
      "\"At the end of the season we can be the worst team in Premier League in history with a European title, so it will not change anything. We know this season was really disappointing for everybody, nothing is going to change [that]. I felt that and still feel that this season was the worst, I don’t say in history but for sure in the last 50 years.\"",
      "Amorim also played down Arsene Wenger's recent suggestion that UEFA should rewrite their rules to stop the winners of the Europa League automatically qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "If Tottenham hold on to their 3-1 advantage to beat Bodo/Glimt on Thursday then it will be an all-Premier League Europa League final between the teams currently 15th and 16th in England's top flight, but one of them would secure backdoor entry to Europe's premier club competition.",
      "\"I just know the rules. If people want to change the rules by all means but these are the rules, if you win Europa League you go to Champions League, so we follow the rules,\" said Amorim.,",
      "\"I know the Champions League should be for teams who are champions or the best teams in the league but they find this way of promoting the competition so we just follow the rules and manage the end of the season with that. We cannot go by the Premier League, so we follow the rules and go for it for the Europa League.\""

      "Only the most highly rated talents in the academy are given a professional contract at 17 and Mantato is included in that bracket. Premier League clubs Chelsea, Liverpool, Newcastle and Brighton showed an interest in signing Mantato last year, but he has been tied down at United."

      "There is sense in offering Heaton a deal into his 40s anyway. He is a reliable goalkeeper, with relatively low mileage in recent years, offers plenty of experience and is considered something of a dressing room leader at Carrington.",

      "United have at least one foot in the final after winning 3-0 in Bilbao last week. The news that Nico and Inaki Williams will miss the second leg has boosted their chances of securing a return to the city on May 21.",
      "Ruben Amorim was without Matthijs de Ligt during Wednesday's training session after he limped off against Brentford this week. Christian Eriksen was also missing, and his absence was considered a precaution.",
      "The 15 minutes we get to see of open training usually means we get a glimpse of the warm-up rondos, and it always proves the point about how competitive professional footballers are.",
      "There is always a desire to string as many passes together as possible, but towards the end of the drill there was a heated debate about the rules of the rondos.",
      "Harry Maguire was convinced he was swapping with Rasmus Hojlund, only for the striker to hold his ground and say he hadn't broken any rules. Hojlund stopped the ball with his hands to set the drill up, but Maguire felt he had committed an infringement. For a few seconds they both stood in the outer circle, refusing to give any ground.",
      "Hojlund said 'no, no' as Maguire tried to swap. The centre-back responded with 'you can't stop it twice, everyone knows that rule'. In the end, assistant coach Carlos Fernandes blew his whistle and the players headed off to do something else, but it showed how competitive things can get.",
      "There was the usual pre-training tunnel in the Carrington sunshine, with three players running through it and getting slaps from their teammates.",
      "Chido Obi was first to line up after making his first professional start at Brentford, before Bruno Fernandes told Mason Mount to get in the queue after his first start in five months.",
      "Just as it looked like it would be those two running the gauntlet, Amorim instructed Luke Shaw to take his place as well, having captained United for the first time in the defeat at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "We don't often see goalkeepers participating in the rondos, but all four of United's were involved this week, and you can see why the club is considering keeping third-choice shot-stopper Tom Heaton for another year.",
      "He might have turned 39 last week, but Heaton was one of the most vocal figures at training and set an upbeat mood at the start of the session. He engaged easily with teammates and cracked jokes as players made mistakes in the rondos.",
      "He stretched gamely to try and rescue a shaky pass from Shaw but couldn't keep the ball in, only for the Carrington sprinklers to spring into action from nowhere, sending the players scampering. It was Shaw who seemed to cope for most of the spray, and Heaton enjoyed the moment, telling him: \"That's karma.\"",
      "There was another academy call-up among the 24-man training squad at Carrington, with 18-year-old midfielder Zach Baumann included, with Christian Eriksen sitting the session out.",
      "Baumann was a quiet presence at the start of the session but fitted in as he made up the numbers in one rondo group, levelling out the numbers at 12 each.",
      "A coach called for the 'youngest player' in the other group to move to make up the numbers and although Bendito Mantato and Chido Obi are 17, Baumann took it on himself to fit in and swap groups.",
      "The absence of Matthijs de Ligt from the session wasn't quite as disastrous as it might have been, with United cruising in the tie and boosted by the absence of Nico and Inaki Williams in the Athletic Club squad.",
      "There was also the welcome sight a pitch further away of Ayden Heaven training on his own as he nears a comeback after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "The teenager has been one of the feel-good stories since his January move from Arsenal, and if he can get fit, he could feature again in the Premier League before the end of the season.",

      "Overcoming their opposition has now seemingly become even harder with a second huge injury blow confirmed by Postecoglou before their second leg. In the 3-1 victory last Thursday, Dominic Solanke and James Maddison both picked up injuries with the latter's issue being much more serious.",
      "\"Madders from the first leg,\" Postecoglou said when asked for the latest team news. \"So he's out. He'll miss the rest of this season and disappointing for him. I'm disappointed for him because he's been a real catalyst for us. He'll miss out but that's been the story of our season.",
      "\"Everyone else from the first leg has travelled and they're ready to go. Dom is fine and ready to go, he's trained with the team.\"",
      "Lucas Bergvall was already ruled out for the season prior to the first leg due to ankle injury picked up in training. With Maddison joining him in the treatment room, that is two key absences Spurs will have to deal with if they are able to reach the final in Bilbao.",

      "Manchester United are in a tough position financially and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's comments and actions have aligned with that fact.",
      "To put it bluntly, United are in a mess. They need to make huge adjustments to their squad to fit Ruben Amorim's vision but they do not have an unlimited budget to make that happen.",
      "MEN Sport understands the plan to make Amorim's team this summer rests firmly on the ability to sell players. Sadly, United are in a position where they can't just consider selling deadwood to create a budget.",
      "The likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho have both been tipped towards the exit door at Old Trafford. Both are young starlets who represent high sell-on value and you can tell that Amorim would rather keep both men but knows that is not possible.",
      "In January, the Portuguese head coach was coy on Garnacho's future telling reporters before the Argentine ultimately stayed: \"I don't know what will happen. Let's focus on the team and the players that we have here.",
      "\"We don't know what can happen until the window closes. Anything can happen.\"",
      "Meanwhile, on Mainoo, he added: \"Our idea is always to keep the best players and the players we build for this club. But we know the position the club is in at the moment. We will see.\"",
      "After such a poor season, it seems only right that the door is open for all players to leave if the offer is right. While some would be more reluctant departures than others, it looked as though all scenarios remained on the table until Wednesday afternoon when Amorim confirmed the one player he would not sell.",
      "This week has seen rumours circulate surrounding the future of Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford. Al Hilal are reportedly weighing up a move for the Portuguese midfielder after being understandably impressed by his Premier League performances.",
      "Whether Fernandes would be interested in a move to Saudi Arabia is another matter but Amorim's comments when addressing the speculation were particularly telling. \"I think it is easy to understand that [transfer speculation], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays,\" he explained prior to tomorrow's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "\"He is a top player and we need top players. He is a leader, the captain.",
      "\"It is natural that people want Bruno, but we want to keep him. He is one of the top players of the world.\"",
      "No cagey response, no edging his bets. This was definitive.",
      "Fernandes is not for sale at any price, no matter how bad the financial picture is at Old Trafford. It could be argued that Amorim feels more confident making such a definitive argument when the rumoured interest is from Al Hilal - a club that is unlikely to appeal to the midfielder.",
      "Would he speak as definitively if the interest was from Real Madrid? Who knows.",
      "However, it seems that Fernandes would need to initiate his exit from the club before United even remotely consider letting him go. Now that will be good news to United supporters."

      "This time last week, even the most optimistic Manchester United supporter would have struggled to predict the strong position this team finds itself in heading into the Europa League semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.",
      "Athletic Bilbao were not helped by the sending off in the first half to Dani Vivian but in truth, United were good value for their lead once Casemiro put them ahead on the half hour mark. Sitting with a three-goal aggregate advantage was ultimately just rewards for the performance they put in on the night.",
      "Without trying to sound too cliche, Athletic Club can no longer beat United now, only Ruben Amorim's men can do that now. With such a healthy advantage, inconsistency is the only danger that Thursday night's tie at Old Trafford poses.",
      "If United are not fully switched on they could be punished even without Nico Williams, Inaki Williams and their leading goalscorer Oihan Sancet lining up for the Basque club. So how do United overcome this problem?",
      "Well to do that, they need to have the right mentality and Amad's admission in a throwaway interview with Sports Direct suggests they are missing two players who are fundamental to that. \"Diogo [Dalot] and Licha [Martinez],\" was the Ivorian's response when asked who the hardest trainers in the group were.",
      "\"Licha [is the most difficult player to face in training],\" he would clarify in an interview with MUTV. \"He’s very strong in the training. For him, the training is like the Champions League final.",
      "\"He never trains easy, he goes stronger, so it’s harder to train against him.\" Having these types of players in the squad is invaluable particularly for a game like this.",
      "With such a healthy advantage, the mind can wander and this group does have a few players who are younger with less experience than some of their counterparts. Both Dalot and Martinez are injured for the return leg in Manchester and the problem that United need to overcome is how they manage to remain fully focused to ensure a comfortable progression to the final.",
      "United simply cannot allow their attention to dip to the extent it did on Sunday where they allowed Brentford to comeback from a goal down to lead 4-1. Yes, Amorim's side managed to pull it back to a respectable 4-3 but Athletic Club will not give them the same grace.",
      "So Amorim needs to find a new Martinez, a new Dalot, who can keep the motivation high and avoid them slipping to what would be a historically poor defeat at Old Trafford."

      "Maybe wing-backs are making a comeback. Ruben Amorim's three-man defence is yet to catch the imagination at Manchester United, but elsewhere, there is evidence that the system is capable of delivering teams that challenge at the very top.",
      "On Tuesday night, Simone Inzaghi's Internazionale reached a second Champions League final in three years after winning perhaps the greatest semi-final the competition has ever seen, beating Barcelona 7-6 on aggregate after two games of the highest quality.",
      "Inzaghi might just be the most under-appreciated coach in Europe, and steering this ageing Inter side to another shot at the European Cup is a remarkable triumph. Matteo Darmian still gets games on a regular basis, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan is a key man in midfield at 36.",
      "The Nou Camp and San Siro thrillers against Barcelona were a perfect clash of styles that delivered 210 minutes of the most spell-binding, watchable football, and it was the team with wing-backs that showed they had the tactical edge.",
      "Inter might not be the only Champions League challengers playing that system next season. Xabi Alonso looks set to take over as Real Madrid manager, and the Spaniard has been wedded to wing-backs at Bayer Leverkusen. In a team often considered to lack a tactical identity, it would be fascinating to see Alonso drill Real into a three-man defence with flying wing-backs.",
      "The system worked superbly for him in Germany, winning a remarkable Bundesliga title last season as well as winning the German cup and reaching the Europa League final. They are on course to finish second this time around.",
      "What links Inter and Bayer Leverkusen is the quality of their wing-backs. Jeremie Frimpong is more of a winger than a wing-back and has played high up the pitch for the Netherlands, while Alex Grimaldo has 12 goals and 20 assists from the left under Alonso.",
      "In years to come, when Inter vs Barcelona is remembered as an epic semi-final, it will be impossible to tell the story of the game without analysing the role of the irrepressible Denzel Dumfries. Of Inter's seven goals, he scored two and created three, and his non-stop running was key to exploiting Barca's high line.",
      "Dumfries is a classic right wing-back and has the speed and athleticism to play the role. He has been used there by the Netherlands as well and caught the eye in the 2022 World Cup.",
      "On the left, Inzaghi uses the more creative Federico Dimarco, who doesn't possess the speed of Dumfries but has an excellent left foot and is a superb passer and crosser of the ball. In many ways, it is the same kind of balance that Alonso has used at Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Inzaghi and Alonso are certainly proving that a wing-back system can bring success at the highest level, which should be music to Ruben Amorim's ears at a time when his tactical outlook is being questioned. United have looked good in their back three in the Europa League, but have struggled in the Premier League.",
      "There is a theory that the system isn't suited to domestic football, that the build-up can be too slow and doesn't allow enough bodies to get forward. But Wolves are showing it can work.",
      "The presence of Vitor Pereira's side on a list including Inter and Bayer Leverkusen looks incongruous, but the Portuguese coach has got his team playing superbly and picking up excellent results in the Premier League. Again, so much of their play goes through the wing-backs, the more secure Nelson Semedo and the relentlessly attacking Rayan Ait-Nouri.",
      "If there is a lesson here for United and Amorim, it is that the success of these teams is in many ways defined by the quality and contribution of their wing-backs, and in attacking roles more than defensive ones.",
      "This is an area Amorim's United have to improve in. Patrick Dorgu looks a more natural fit after his £25million January move from Lecce, and Amad can do a job as a more progressive, attack-minded wing-back, although his future might eventually lie as a No.10.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui have regularly been used as wing-backs this season. Dalot's game has improved, and although he can add more of an attacking edge, he is getting there. Mazraoui is more of a defensive full-back, as evidenced by the fact that he is starting games as a centre-back on a regular basis.",
      "This summer promises to be busy at United, especially if they win the Europa League and secure the Champions League riches. However, as Amorim looks to improve and reshape his squad, the success of wing-backs at clubs playing a similar system shows just how important it is to get those roles right."

      "Former Manchester United forward James Wilson has been released by Northampton Town. The 29-year-old, who was tipped by Louis van Gaal to replace Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford, has become a free agent at the end of the League One season.",
      "Wilson is one of 11 players that have been let go by Northampton - less than 12 months after joining the club from Port Vale. He failed to score in 12 first-team appearances for the Cobblers.",
      "Tyler Magloire, Jack Sowerby, Ali Koiki, Liam McCarron, Harvey Lintott, Akin Odimayo, Will Hondermarck, TJ Eyoma, Nik Tzanev and Reuben Wyatt have also been shown the door.",
      "Northampton head coach, Kevin, Nolan said in a statement: \"We have made some difficult decisions and it is never nice having to tell a player that their contract is not being renewed.",
      "\"Some of these players have been at the club a number of years, and have played a big part here, helping the club enjoy some good times over the last few years, and all of the departing players will leave with our thanks and best wishes.",
      "\"We believe we have a good core of players here, both in terms of ability and culture, which is very important and we are excited to be entering into discussions with our chosen targets to build on and add to that over the course of the summer.\"",
      "Wilson joined United in 2002, aged seven, and progressed through the youth system at Carrington before signing his first professional contract a decade later. He made his professional debut from the start against Hull City in the final match of the 2013/2014 season, and grabbed a brace in a 3-1 win.",
      "\"You have seen a little glimpse of the future,\" then interim manager Ryan Giggs said after that game. \"This is what this club is about. We never stand still. We give youth a chance as we try and play attractive football.\"",
      "\"He's a natural goalscorer, but he has got more to his game than that,\" Giggs said of Wilson. \"He can run at people, he has got pace and he's a clever player.\"",
      "However, that was as good as it got for Wilson at United. He made 19 further appearances for the club - scoring three goals - and spent time on loan with Brighton, Derby County, Sheffield United and Aberdeen before leaving his boyhood club at the end of his contract in July 2019.",
      "After a successful loan stint, Wilson joined Aberdeen on a permanent deal, but it didn't work out in Scotland. He returned to England in January 2020 - as he signed for League Two side Salford City on an 18-month deal. Wilson made his debut in a 3-2 defeat against Plymouth Argyle, scoring twice as a substitute.",
      "It felt as though that could be the lift Wilson needed to resurrect his career, but he left the Ammies at the end of his contract after scoring eight goals in 29 matches during the 2020/2021 season.",
      "He signed for Port Vale and hit the ground running in Staffordshire. Throughout his first campaign at the Valiants, he scored 15 goals in 47 appearances across all competitions. However, Wilson's form dipped - and he netted just eight times across the next two seasons before leaving the club last summer.",
      "Following his move to Northampton in July 2024, there was hope Wilson could recapture his goal-scoring touch, but it hasn't worked out and he's now without a club."

Ronaldo Sr has supported his eldest son in his pursuit to follow in his footsteps, but is also keen not to put any pressure on him.",
      "“This generation, it is difficult to tell them something and let them do it,” he explained last year via The Mirror. “They will always see their daddy as an example; they see me every day in what I do, at home, in training, or in a game.",
      "\"They see me work a lot. Right at this moment, Cristiano wants to be a football player but I don't make big pressure, I make a little.",
      "\"He's 14 years old, he has pressure already to be the son of Cristiano [senior]. Let him do his own mistakes, but I hope that in the future he can be a professional player.",
      "“If he doesn't become a player, maybe another job, but I will always support him. We cannot put pressure on our sons because we are famous.”",
      "He added: “It makes me happy to be here, not just because my son is here too. This age is very important because in four or five years they will be professional.",

There was a love-in when Fulham made the final in 2010. They were 12th in the Premier League. Their conquerors, Atletico, were a nondescript ninth in La Liga.",

      "Villa have not won a trophy since the League Cup was known as the Coca-Cola Cup. Worthington, Carling, and Carabao have been poured into it over the decades since. Harry Maguire had just turned three when Villa beat Leeds United. You only have to look at the curtain haircuts from back then to know how long ago it was.",

United-Spurs would be the most consequential Europa League final in living memory. Two historic English clubs with European pedigree.",

      "This is the worst domestic United side in 51 years and Tottenham have not been this bad since Christian Gross took the tube to Seven Sisters in 1997. What's new? Bad teams can win cups. Liverpool did in 2005, having lost 14 (FOURTEEN) league matches. Wigan Athletic were relegated three days after they shocked Manchester City in the 2013 FA Cup final.",

      "We haven’t updated the manager rankings for a bit, so we’re sneaking a quick update – you know, just the 7000 or so words – before doing a full and proper job on it when the season ends.",
      "It is, of course, the most scientific and rigorous of endeavours so if you find yourself disagreeing with anyone’s placing simply know and understand you just aren’t as clever as the supercomputer we pumped full of data to deliver results absolutely none of which are as silly as when we accidentally had Kieran McKenna seventh last time.",
      "You can read that malfunction and the rest of the last update here if you absolutely must, but the TL;DR placings are in the brackets below.",
      "",
      "30) Erik Ten Hag, Man United August-October (28)\nShould obviously have been sacked in the summer, could very easily have been sacked after either of the two grimmest thrashings – Liverpool and Spurs – and arguably most compellingly of all should have gone after trying to convince himself and the world that a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was evidence of anything much at all about his future prospects.",
      "As we said after he was eventually put out of our collective misery last year:",
      "As is very often the case for a flailing manager – especially at the biggest clubs – he is not really the biggest problem but nor does he show any hint of being in any way part of a possible solution.",
      "The football is uninspiring and, much as we hate the phrase, increasingly small time. Ten Hag’s confidence has shrunk to the point that he no longer feels able to take his team to a place like Aston Villa and do anything more than cling grimly to the 0-0 he started with.",
      "There are teams where you can justifiably point to hard-earned, backs-to-the-wall goalless draws at Crystal Palace and Aston Villa as evidence that you know what you are doing and are going to get the job done, but Manchester United surely cannot ever be one of those clubs.",
      "The irony, of course, is that a man who spent a large part of the second half of his United managerial career desperately insisting that results be ignored finally did get the tin-tack after a result that on its own probably could have been ignored.",
      "Given the chances United missed – Diogo Dalot’s in particular was one for the all-time list and probably not really Ten Hag’s fault if we’re being fair about it – and the genuine absurdity of the penalty that eventually settled it, there is a strong case to be made that West Ham 2-1 Man United is the most easily dismissed result in the Premier League since Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool.",
      "It wasn’t quite as abysmal a bit of officiating as that one, but it was arguably worse because a) it came so late in the piece and b) represented VAR actively changing a perfectly fine decision rather than a failure – however ludicrous – to overturn an error that already existed.",
      "But when you have somehow come out the other side of at least four clear sacking windows as Ten Hag so obviously had, the sympathy that exists for getting the boot during an altogether more opaque one can only be very limited indeed. He had to go, and even United’s struggles to adapt to life under Ruben Amorim don’t really offer much vindication for Ten Hag given that so much of that struggle is down to the squad rot – both in personnel and mindset – that was allowed to fester during his time.",
      "",
      "29) Ivan Juric, Southampton, December-April (27)\nBeing both appointed and sacked by two clubs during one season is novel, even for a manager who has now had nine managerial jobs and lasted less than 50 games in seven of them, including all three of his spells as Genoa manager between June 2016 and December 2018.",
      "No wonder he had itchy feet after three whole seasons at Torino, who he left last summer before taking over at Roma in September, being sacked in November, then taking over at Southampton in December before again being sacked in April. Slightly disappointing he hasn’t managed to squeeze in another job in Italy before the season finishes, if we’re being brutally honest.",
      "His Southampton reign was a failure, obviously. But it didn’t have to be quite so hefty a failure, surely. Not managing to save them from themselves is one thing, being really no better than Martin in any significantly measurable way and statistically inferior to Simon Rusk, the caretaker who preceded and followed him, is not a good look.",
      "",
      "28) Russell Martin, Southampton, August-November (26)\nYou can’t blame a guy for trying, can you? Having sat and watched Vincent Kompany brazenly and above all successfully place his own career prospects several levels above Burnley’s survival prospects last season, you can forgive Russell Martin for wanting a slice of that pie having surprised many by steering Southampton back to the top flight.",
      "The problem is that Southampton were even less suited to trying to Pepball their way around the Barclays than Burnley. Burnley had at least cruised through the Championship in dominant fashion; Southampton scraped up through the play-offs after an end to the season in which even a relegation-haunted Huddersfield had scared the living sh*t out of them.",
      "And lo it came to pass that Southampton were not capable of passing Premier League sides to death. There is a wider point here about wanting to do this.",
      "It’s something that now-established teams like Brighton and Brentford didn’t do when they first came up. They showed the Barclays some damn respect. These days everyone wants everything instantly, and these teams and managers think they can just saunter on in here and started passing out from the back from day one.",
      "The utter and total failure of Southampton and Martin, who we fear remains unlikely to be the next manager of Bayern Munich despite his impeccable credentials, should at least serve as a warning to others.",
      "READ: Promoted clubs’ predictable relegation is a further sign the Premier League has broken English football",
      "",
      "27) Julen Lopetegui, West Ham August-January (25)\nGetting rid of David Moyes in the hope of finding something a bit more proactive and enjoyable and then replacing him with the Spanish Moyes was always an interesting choice from a club that deals almost exclusively in interesting choices, but it’s still been striking to watch just how badly it’s gone and in such Moyesian fashion.",
      "The worst of Moyes’ West Ham were so, so similar to the worst of Lopetegui’s: unnecessarily painful to watch given the talent available, but also and more damningly utterly ineffectively painful to watch. The 4-1 defeat at Man City was the ninth league game out of 20 this season in which the Hammers had conceded at least three goals.",
      "It could only ever end one way, and given how bad West Ham have been you do almost have to hand it to the way the people running that club managed to make Lopetegui look like a wounded victim by making such a complete bollocks of his very necessary departure. Sacking managers is part of the game, but you can still do it with some dignity and grace.",
      "Making the poor sod take training on the morning of a day he knows is going to be his last was just deeply weird, deeply unpleasant behaviour. It makes no sense unless viewed as some kind of desperate ploy to enrage Lopetegui to the point that he might jump before they had to push him.",
      "",
      "26) Ben Dawson, Leicester, November-December (24)\nLeft Newcastle in the summer after 15 years in various academy and age-group coaching roles for a job on Steve Cooper’s coaching team at Leicester. Might have been an error. Named caretaker following Cooper’s departure, he oversaw a 4-1 defeat at Brentford before handing the reins to Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "",
      "25) Gary O’Neil, Wolves, August-December (23)\nAn apparent recovery on the back of two straight wins and a four-game unbeaten run in October and November crashed and burned spectacularly as Wolves lost three straight games, one of which involved the genuinely weirdly impressive achievement of conceding four goals to Everton.",
      "O’Neil’s job was very much on the line ahead of a home game with Ipswich, one that ended with a late winner for Wolves’ relegation rivals and star man Matheus Cunha getting fisty with stewards. So, on balance, a sub-optimal run of form and antics. It felt like the end. It was the end.",
      "And now we don’t really know what happens next for O’Neil. He’s a man who has now completed two genuinely impressive firefighting jobs from hospital passes (need a police reference here really don’t we, but buggered if we can think of one) at first Bournemouth and then Wolves. But having been replaced to such great effect at Bournemouth by Andoni Iraola and now having made a right bollocks of things at Wolves after his first stab at an actual pre-season of proper preparation he might just be a bit stuck.",
      "To make matters worse, he has now been even more swiftly and conspicuously outperformed by his replacement at Molineux than he was at the Vitality.",
      "There are presumably two kinds of jobs that now exist for O’Neil’s next foray. One, another desperate Premier League club enlists his proven relegation-avoiding credentials but that means waiting until someone like West Ham sh*t themselves with panic in around October.",
      "Two, and perhaps more likely, an upwardly-mobile ambitious Championship club tasks him with doing the ‘getting into the Premier League’ bit before his specialist subject of ‘staying in the Premier League’, which is now so difficult for promoted clubs that it is essentially witchcraft.",
      "What we do know for certain is that O’Neil will get the job on the back of some fine video screen analysis and Speaking Well, I Thought on Monday Night Football.",
      "",
      "24) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Leicester, December onwards (21)\nA fun little bit from this season has been Ruud van Nistelrooy being at the heart of both the best and worst bits of decision-making all season long.",
      "Manchester United haven’t got much right this year, but appointing a bona-fide club legend as interim manager to chuck in a few mood-boosting results before swiftly and correctly replacing him before it all went horribly sour – as all manner of subsequent evidence suggests it absolutely and entirely would have – suggests that at least someone somewhere at that daft club learned something from the Solskjaer years.",
      "One of the main reasons to doubt the sustainability of Van Nistelrooy’s United bounce was the fact that two of his four games and two of his three wins came against Leicester.",
      "This appears to have been a factor in Leicester’s decision to appoint him manager. Which at first glance appears understandable but only gets more weird the more you think about it. Why appoint a manager based on the fact he has proved he can beat you, when that is the one thing he can never, ever do in the job you’ve just given him?",
      "Although, we guess, actually he kind of did. He oversaw two games in which United beat Leicester while he was United boss, and then did the same again as Leicester boss. We should have expected no different.",
      "Hard to see him staying on for the attempt to get Leicester back into the Premier League next year, but if he does walk away he does so as the proud owner of one of the more compelling examples of The Joke Is Always On Spurs.",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s effort was so long and repetitive that even Stewart Lee might have rejected it, with 15 defeats scattered either side of Leicester’s 2-1 win at Spurs. After the two goals early in the second half of that one they abandoned goalscoring altogether for more than two months.",
      "That 16-match, four-months-in-the-making joke is also bookended by a pair of 2-2 draws with Brighton, which means that, we guess, the joke is also always a tiny bit on Brighton for some reason. Maybe needs some more digging, that one.",
      "READ: Ranking this season’s Premier League managerial changes from Vitor to Ruud",
      "",
      "23) Sean Dyche, Everton, August-January (20)\nThe last manager rankings were compiled just days before Everton gave Dyche the Spanish Archer, and if you’ll indulge us we would like to revel in this rare example of us having got the situation pretty much spot on.",
      "Current Sack Race favourite and you have to say that’s fair enough. There really isn’t any compelling excuse for Everton to be slumming it like this in a grimly miserable relegation scrap again, and if Dyche cannot build a coherent case that he’s the best man to keep them above the relegation waterline, then really what is the point?",
      "The belligerent run of spoiling draws against City, Arsenal and Chelsea is starting to look more and more like a defiant but futile last hurrah for Dyche’s particular brand of misery with Everton increasingly inclined to look elsewhere for a manager who might do more than drag them a point above the relegation zone with such misery-inducing football. Feels like for a club of Everton’s history and stature you might be able to get away with flirting with relegation and you might be able to get away with football that makes the ears bleed, but you can only do both for so long before it just becomes demeaning for all concerned.",
      "Everton finally losing their long and proudly-held top-tier record the precise moment they move into a shiny new stadium is just far too Everton a piece of behaviour to be ruled out, and it does look more and more like it might need a change of direction, a change of mood, and a change of manager to prevent that nightmare scenario becoming horrifyingly real.",
      "What Everton have subsequently achieved under David Moyes – even if the new manager bounce has inevitably lost a bit of air from its glorious early days – damns Dyche further.",
      "He really did have them in a full-blown relegation scrap, in this Premier League season of all Premier League seasons, and wasn’t even going about it in entertaining fashion.",
      "",
      "22) Steve Cooper, Leicester August-November (22)\n‘Nobody is currently talking about Steve Cooper’ we chirped in November. Turns out we just weren’t listening. He was gone within days, with nobody much happy with the sufferball on offer even though it was keeping Leicester very much afloat in a choppy and complicated relegation fight.",
      "The timing of his dismissal was odd, coming as it did after a narrow defeat to Chelsea straight after the international break that rather indicated he was already done for and a new manager could have been given a bit more time during that break to get his feet under the desk.",
      "All became clearer, mind, when Ruud van Nistelrooy – who only completed his interim duties at Manchester United at said international break – was the man anointed as the saviour of Leicester’s season just after inflicting a couple of sizeable blows upon it with the Foxes’ relegation rivals United.",
      "It went… poorly.",
      "",
      "21) Graham Potter, West Ham, January onwards (15)\nFeels like a much better post-Moyes fit for the Hammers than Julen Lopetegui ever did, and we retain hope that it will all work out in the end. But uncomfortably and unavoidably true it is not working out currently for a team whose current eight-game run without a win includes the twin embarrassments of home draws against both Southampton and a barely-interested Spurs.",
      "Potter should be better than this. West Ham should be better than this. They are currently just about the only team really giving the incoming promoted sides hope that the story of the last couple of seasons can change.",
      "And that’s a pretty embarrassing state of affairs for both club and manager. The start of a season is obviously always important for all sorts of managers for all sorts of reasons, but those early weeks of next season right now feel more important for Potter than anyone else in this league.",
      "",
      "20) Kieran McKenna, Ipswich (7)\nSeventh? Ahem. Sorry about that. A giddiness that we are now attributing to a desperate desire for at least one of the promoted trio to give survival a real shot. Even back in January it was clear Ipswich offered the best/only hope of that, but they too have ultimately come up well short.",
      "It does feel like over the season as a whole they have been more consistently more competitive than the other two, and unlike both Leicester and Southampton there is a decent body of evidence to go with a gut feel that they still have the right man in charge to try and earn them another chance back in the top flight next season.",
      "Luton remain the warning from history there, but for now McKenna has just about emerged from this season with reputation intact if not perhaps enhanced in the way he might have hoped or expected.",
      "",
      "19) Ange Postecoglou, Tottenham (19)\nOne of two potential absolute noodle-scratchers when the final rankings are put together a month from now.",
      "But while it is Ruben Amorim who insists winning the Europa League cannot save United’s season, it’s really Postecoglou for whom it feels more of a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.",
      "It’s not to say it wouldn’t be a huge achievement – and Spurs’ recent performances in the latter stages of the competition have been pretty compelling – and it would absolutely be a huge deal for Spurs as a whole.",
      "But could it or should it save Postecoglou? We’re really not sure it should. If the Europa League efforts offer some mitigation for both the poor recent league results and the shoddiness of the returns during their injury crisis, they also damn Postecoglou as well.",
      "Because it should never have got that bad during the injury problems and it should never have remained this bad when the injured players returned, Europa distractions or no Europa distractions.",
      "There’s also the sticky issue of how and why he’s been able to coax such whole-hearted performances out of this squad on Europa League nights but not in the Premier League.",
      "United and Spurs have probably benefited from the presence of each other in the same unexpected area of the league table this season, each serving to normalise the ridiculousness of the other.",
      "But it is Postecoglou who has less excuse for being there. He’s in the second full season of his plan, and the fact a 17th-place finish remains entirely possible is a stain that not even winning the Europa could or should wash away entirely.",
      "Tottenham’s league form has now been absolutely rotten for a strikingly long time; since the heady days of those first 10 games of last season in which Ange’s swashbucklers picked up eight wins and two draws they’ve managed only 78 points from 63 games, very nearly half of which have been lost.",
      "To put that in full perspective; those first 10 games of last season still account for a quarter of all Postecoglou’s Premier League points. Even including that run with its eight wins and no defeats he has still has just as many losses as wins in the Premier League.",
      "Winning the Europa League might still save his job for now, especially with Spurs’ much-discussed record when it comes to such things, but we will be staggered if he starts 2026 as Spurs manager.",
      "",
      "18) Ruben Amorim, Manchester United, November onwards (18)\nThe pure absurdity of the Europa League run is doing a lot of heavy lifting and the fact we’ve now reached the point where United winning it and thus securing a third silverware-winning season in a row despite being increasingly dreadful has just about tipped over from possibility to probability is absolutely wild.",
      "But this remains one of the most clear-cut cautionary tales this division has ever served up. Man United got it wrong last summer and Amorim got it wrong in failing to call United’s bluff when they insisted it was now or never in November. He should have stayed with Sporting like he wanted to, and backed himself to have opportunities at least as good as this one – even very probably this precise one – come the summer.",
      "He could also absolutely have shown at least hints of flexibility in acknowledging the squad was not up to the challenge of what he would be demanding.",
      "It’s not his fault that United’s squad was left technically, physically and mentally weak by previous managers and regimes, but it is still his fault that he didn’t recognise that at the outset or accept the reality of it during the season.",
      "The sheer incompetence of the teams below United has prevented things becoming even worse, but his Premier League record is miserable and it’s going to take one heck of a summer to offer any meaningful resolution. The full rebuild required is going to take at least a couple more windows beyond that.",
      "The Europa League run has been spectacularly entertaining throughout, but the starkest of facts is in that league form. United have won only twice since January, against Ipswich and Leicester. If next season begins anything like the way this one is ending, Amorim will be in big trouble very quickly and that silverware will not save him.",
      "",
      "17) Simon Rusk, Southampton, December and April onwards (17)\nHis two brief interim stints have delivered over 18 per cent of Southampton’s Premier League points this season and 50 per cent of their clean sheets in 13 per cent of their games, thus making Rusk – stopgap between Russell Martin’s egocentric Kompany-lite stylings and whatever it is Ivan Juric was attempting to achieve and now between Juric and whatever comes next – comfortably Southampton’s most impressive manager of the season.",
      "Had Rusk been manager for the whole season it is a clear statistical certainty that they would now have 15 points and left Derby for dust. Undeniable facts.",
      "",
      "16) Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, Everton, January (NE)\nOne hundred per cent record after a 2-0 FA Cup third-round win over League One strugglers Peterborough in a sole game in charge before David Moyes’ glorious return, you’ll never sing that.",
      "",
      "15) Mikel Arteta, Arsenal (13)\nIt can still all change upon this very night but if Arteta and Arsenal can’t pull off a great escape in Paris and deliver Champions League success than this is going to be a season that contains all manner of awkward questions that will require addressing.",
      "Especially when it’s a season that carries still the prospect of Arsenal finishing third (or worse…) in a two-horse race and having to watch all the clubs joining them in the Champions League next season win silverware.",
      "Liverpool have a trophy. Newcastle have a trophy. Chelsea will probably have a trophy. Man City will probably have a trophy. And most humiliatingly of all, either Spurs or Man United will almost certainly have a trophy.",
      "It doesn’t spell the end of Arteta by any stretch, and we’ve talked before about just how hard it is to put together three title-challenging seasons in a row. It might well be that this was always Arsenal’s fallow season and it’s just the inadequacy of others that kept them artificially and deceptively high in the table.",
      "But there has been a clear regression in their league form, with a lack of the clinical ability to get the job done that marked them out as the real deal in the second half of last season. Points have been frittered carelessly and consistently with the injury problems providing at best partial mitigation only.",
      "It all makes next season feel like a decisive one for Arteta and his – still worth remembering, this – enormously ambitious plan to restore Arsenal to the summit of English football after a couple of decades away.",
      "It is not easy, this season has provided more questions than answers and exposed some familiar failings.",
      "",
      "14) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Man United, October-November (10)\nYeah, that genuinely went brilliantly well. Credit to everyone here. If we were going to have a four-match reign as Manchester United manager, what we’d do is to make sure that all four of those matches were at home and, ideally, two of them against Leicester and another against PAOK in the Europa League. Get some lovely fat wins under the belt.",
      "But let’s not pretend United would have won those three games as straightforwardly under Erik Ten Hag (or, it must now be conceded, Ruben Amorim) as they did under Ruud. It’s not really Ten Hag’s fault, but everything had become extremely stressful by that point. Absolutely nothing was coming easily, and maybe one of those three games might have been straightforward. But at least one would have been harrowing.",
      "And perhaps the most impressive result of Van Nistelrooy’s reign was the one game he didn’t win, with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea giving us far more information than some easy wins over dreck.",
      "Essentially, though, it was the perfect interim stint. It’s had all the positives of the initial Ole caretaker spell, with the instant mood-lifting morale boost of seeing a bona fide club legend in the hotseat, without any of the unpleasantness of mistakenly leaving him there for another two years after that initial buzz had entirely worn off.",
      "",
      "13) Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace (14)\nA curious Premier League season in which Glasner’s side won none of their first eight games and now none of their most recent five means that they might somehow still fall short of that apparently impenetrable 50-point mark despite a run of 34 points in 17 games between December and early April. They now need a ticklish four points from games against Tottenham, Wolves and Liverpool if they are to raise their bat.",
      "But none of that will matter at all if Glasner can become the first Crystal Palace manager to win a major honour in the FA Cup final against a Man City side who despite recent improvements remain distinctly vulnerable.",
      "",
      "12) Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton (11)\nLook, this is probably still more of a Brighton thing than a Hurzeler thing but at some point they are simply going to have to decide whether they are any good or not. Until they make up their minds about this, how on earth are any of the rest of us supposed to do so?",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola, Man City (16)\nExtremely plausible that this season now ends with a second-place league finish and a trophy. Which would be one heck of an outcome for a season that flirted for a serious amount of time with genuine disaster.",
      "At their lowest pre-Christmas ebb, City and Guardiola both appeared broken in a way that was dizzyingly unfixable. We’re still not truly convinced he’s fully recovered despite the improvement of results trending back towards something approaching City normality over recent months.",
      "We still feel like this is a season that has pushed him closer to the City exit door rather than convinced him he should hang around to build a new team to go again against Liverpool and Arsenal and whoever else can manage to put together more than a half-season’s worth of results.",
      "The impending departure of Kevin De Bruyne means the loss of another key stabilising, familiar reference point in Guardiola’s City adventure, and for so many reasons next season feels like one that holds more uncertainty for City than just about any other during his outrageously successful reign.",
      "",
      "10) David Moyes, Everton, January onwards (NE)\nPretty mad that we haven’t actually done an update since Moyes’ glorious homecoming to Everton, but it’s been one of the division’s more compelling good-news stories this year.",
      "The new-manager bounce is a real and unignorable phenomenon, but rarely have its effects been more pronounced than during that five-game, 13-point run just after Moyes’ came back to Goodison after 10 often difficult years away.",
      "The whole mood of the club was utterly transformed as the dread fear of relegation and losing that cherished and tightly held top-flight status just before moving into their stunning new ground gripped Everton fans.",
      "At the very least it appeared certain they faced another agonising end to the season in which relegation if it was to be averted would only be dismissed as a prospect late in the season.",
      "Instead it was pretty much off the table by mid-February with Everton instead allowed to spend the last few months giving their grand old ground the proper farewell it deserves without any of those intrusive thoughts about the worst-case scenario.",
      "Even if the highs of those early weeks have faded slightly among a flurry of draws – it’s now six and a solitary win in Everton’s last 10 games – the key work for this season at least had been done.",
      "Now, of course, for the next step. There is no plausible Everton manager more deserving, more worthy of taking them into their new life at their new ground. No manager who could more fully understand everything it means.",
      "But there remain few guarantees about how it will all pan out.",
      "",
      "9) Thomas Frank, Brentford (9)\nFrank is going to remain a top-10 staple for just about any next manager market worth the trouble but we remain entirely wedded to the idea that this is a club and manager in perfect harmony and the idea of either party risking their serendipitous relationship on something flashier is fraught with danger.",
      "It’s probably inevitable at some point, but it’s not something we like to think too hard about. In keeping with the other teams currently jockeying for positions 8 to 11 in the final table, it feels like theirs has been a season that doesn’t really deserve a bottom-half finish even though the cruel reality of maths demand that be somebody’s fate when the music stops.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca, Chelsea (5)\nIt’s not perhaps a satisfactory conclusion, but the one we find ourselves drawing is that Chelsea is simply a place where stuff happens and these days the manager is as much a passenger or bystander as anyone else.",
      "It doesn’t quite seem fair to heap either praise or derision on the fella trying to steer a course through the season at a club that spends so lavishly yet haphazardly.",
      "Maresca has made many mistakes, as a man with his lack of top-level experience was always likely to, but he’s got a lot right as well.",
      "And the fact that when the Champions League spot they had pretty much held all season came under pressure they have responded with a run of 20 points in nine games while remaining on track in the Conference isn’t to be sniffed at.",
      "In summary: Maresca is neither as good as his best nor as bad as his worst. Nothing means anything. It’s all just a bunch of stuff that happened.",
      "",
      "7) Marco Silva, Fulham (8)\nHis side just seem to have run out of puff a bit since the international break, and that’s a shame because until then Fulham appeared to have a very plausible chance to do something extraordinary.",
      "They have even in a weary phase that has delivered a crushing FA Cup defeat and four losses in six Premier League games still managed a thrilling win over Liverpool when that was still at least theoretically meaningful to all concerned.",
      "But it does now look like another mid-table finish for a club and manager that have finished 10th and 13th in the last two years. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that and none of the teams promoted since Fulham were joined by Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest two years has managed anything like it, but finishing 11th would now represent something of a disappointment given where they were and what seemed possible not that long ago.",
      "",
      "6) Unai Emery, Aston Villa (6)\nA tricky one now. Has that PSR-baiting January window been justified by what’s followed? This has been a season that has delivered memories for a lifetime, with Villa’s run to the Champions League quarter-finals an eye-catching one that remained thrilling to the very last moment.",
      "Villa fans have seen things they could surely never have expected to see at Villa Park with Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford combining to give the club a hefty nudge into the second half of the season.",
      "But the likelihood now is that they will finish the season outside even the expanded Champions League places, without the silverware that other similarly equipped clubs will have to show for the campaign and with a sense that what they’ve built this season has been done ever so slightly on sand.",
      "That thumping defeat in the FA Cup semi-final is a really bruising one for Villa. And the way their season ends, with games against Tottenham and Man United, feels strangely apt too. Both clubs will offer a reminder that things could be so much worse, but one will also awkwardly show how things could also have ended up so much better.",
      "",
      "5) Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth (4)\nWe are acutely aware that there is little more annoying to fans of ‘smaller’ clubs than constant media narratives about anyone doing well with them heading off to one of the ‘bigger’ clubs. You only have to look at how upset Liverpool fans are about Trent Alexander-Arnold right now to see that.",
      "We take no joy in prodding at that sore spot and therefore apologise in advance here, but… of all the managers currently overperforming as manager of one of the Premier League’s burgeoning ‘middle-class’ clubs Iraola is the one we’d most like to see take the step up soon.",
      "Because we’re pretty sure he’s the most interesting. We’re pretty sure he’s the one with the greatest variety of possible outcomes.",
      "Placed in charge of one of the bigger beasts might bring the best or worst elements of his work to the surface. Or they might just continue to co-exist as they do now, only with attention shifting inevitably and inexorably to the dodgier parts.",
      "He’s been Bournemouth manager for two years now, and across that time they have almost always resembled either a team that could and should challenge for Europe or one that could and should be battling relegation. There is very little middle-ground.",
      "This is a team that completed a league double over Arsenal yet lost at home to Ipswich. A team that beat Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in successive weeks by an aggregate score of 9-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 11 Premier League games and yet two months later found themselves on a run of one win (against Southampton…) in their next eight.",
      "In the last month alone they have suffered such embarrassments as failing to beat either West Ham or Man United, yet gone to the Emirates and prevailed.",
      "Their last three matches are against Aston Villa, Man City and Leicester and absolutely any result feels as likely as any other in any of those matches.",
      "And all of that is broadly fine at Bournemouth but brings a fascinating and chaotic dynamic to any club higher up the food chain.",
      "Essentially our point with Iraola is this: the exact season he’s produced for Bournemouth to great acclaim this season would be considered among the Spursiest things ever recorded if he were to repeat it at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next season.",
      "For his own sanity and career he should not take that job, but we can’t help wondering what goes off if he does.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira, Wolves, December onwards (12)\nHas triggered an astonishing transformation in Wolves’ fortunes given the mess he inherited from Gary O’Neil.",
      "That start – nine points from the first 16 games of the season – ensured Wolves would be the last team to successfully extract themselves from the biggest non-event in Premier League relegation fight history, but when it happened it happened with absurd speed.",
      "It’s entirely true that Wolves’ squad is not one that should have been in the mess that it was, but nor was it one that could have been expected to so adroitly streak not just clear of the relegation zone but beyond the lower-mid-table stragglers like United, Spurs, Everton and West Ham into comfy mid-table.",
      "And as we’ve noted before: imagine the coverage both Pereira and O’Neil would be getting now had their stories this season been reversed.",
      "",
      "3) Eddie Howe, Newcastle (3)\nIn terms of neatly and effectively meeting a pre-season brief, there’s a strong argument that nobody can match Howe’s achievements this season with Newcastle. Sure, others have more obviously obliterated pre-season targets in thoroughly dramatic fashion, but we’re not sure anyone has taken the two obvious top objectives for a team this season and delivered in the manner of Newcastle.",
      "Back in the Champions League and ending English football’s most ridiculous trophy drought is special, special stuff. Sure, the wider media reaction to Newcastle winning the Carabao might have been too saccharine for most tastes, at times giving the impression that Newcastle had invented winning a trophy after not doing so for ages, at others journalists who have apparently never met a single real-life actual football fan expressing bafflement that all supporters of all clubs weren’t all overjoyed and thrilled about it.",
      "This generally took the form of ‘you just don’t understand what it means’ when the truth was ‘we all understand exactly what it means, we just don’t care as much as Newcastle fans do about it’. This really should be straightforward. Should, say, Tottenham win the Europa League there will be no equivalent media outpouring, no suggestion that if you aren’t as thrilled as Tottenham fans about it all that you simply don’t understand.",
      "So, to be clear: nobody is unclear about the scale and significance of that achievement for Eddie Howe and his team. Not least because even the standard ‘only a Carabao’ barbs struggle to land even more when you consider Newcastle’s run to that trophy.",
      "They took down four of the current top seven en route to glory, thoroughly outclassing Arsenal over two legs in the semi-final and then schooling Liverpool in the final.",
      "One can argue that those clubs had larger primary targets but neither was exactly phoning it in by that stage of the tournament either. And Newcastle beat them up.",
      "The final in particular was a spectacular performance and a huge personal triumph for Howe, who set his team up perfectly to nullify Liverpool’s huge threat at one end without ever curtailing their own attacking capabilities.",
      "The players delivered wonderfully, but this did feel like the manager’s success every bit as much. And for a manager with obvious talent but so little experience of such major finals, that was doubly impressive.",
      "Throw in the now very likely success of goal two – getting back in the Champions League – and you’ve got a manager who in any normal season would be a worthy favourite for manager of the year but in this one finds himself scrapping just to stay on the podium.",
      "",
      "2) Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest (1)\nThere’s a risk that they might be running out of steam at just the wrong time, that a seemingly rock-solid grip on Champions League football might be lost on the run-in.",
      "Forest have won only twice since March in a run that has seen them slip to sixth in the league and go out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage.",
      "And those two wins have been against Manchester United and Tottenham, and at this stage those barely count.",
      "But while we remain keen advocates of the idea that goals change across a season and relative failure can and should often still just be considered failure given the scale of the opportunity being passed up, sometimes you do have to step back and accept that ‘Nottingham Forest only finishing sixth’ would have been a simply batshit sentence to utter in August.",
      "And even more so when Nuno, his reputation in this country in tatters after The Tottenham Unpleasantness, took over a club mired in points deductions and facing relegation.",
      "Two wins at the back end of last season, against the even more stricken Sheffield United and Burnley, were enough to keep Forest up and they have taken that and run with it in remarkable fashion.",
      "Sure, there’s no doubt they’ve been assisted by an unusually high number of big clubs having absolute daftnesses, but they’ve still been hugely impressive.",
      "Forest are not a complicated team to understand, but that’s praiseworthy in itself. They know what they are, what their strengths are and how to get the absolute most out of that more often than not.",
      "Smart recruitment and canny coaching has produced a team more than the sum of its parts, and that’s really all anyone can reasonably ask any manager to produce in what is still less only a season and a half in charge.",
      "",
      "1) Arne Slot, Liverpool (2)\nIt’s very unfair but also true: it has ultimately proved quite hard not to end up using the sheer ease with which Slot has cracked the Premier League puzzle at the first attempt as a counter-intuitive caveat against his achievements this season.",
      "If anything, Clive, he’s almost won his first Premier League title too well.",
      "We’re guilty of it. We still don’t see Slot becoming the next great legacy manager, the next man to put together an era of dominance containing a string of league title a la Ferguson or Guardiola.",
      "We still can’t entirely shake the notion that this has all in some way been a last hurrah for Jurgen Klopp and his team rather than the start of something magical.",
      "And there’s every chance that is going to be made to look like utter foolishness.",
      "Nevertheless, a big part of why Slot’s impact and success might not be quite as hailed as it ought to be is that it’s been so obviously coming for so long that the failure to add any burnishing additional silverware feels vaguely disappointing because human brains are daft things that operate daftly.",
      "What he’s achieved has been staggering, and the easiest and fairest way to measure that is not to simply look just how far clear Liverpool have ended the season – because that really can end up working against them – but where everyone had them finishing when the season began.",
      "They fell away from the title race just as it really got going last season, and few were backing them to match even that under a new manager working largely with the squad he inherited.",
      "It’s been repeatedly and correctly pointed out that Klopp left a very decent squad – albeit one with a few huge contractual roadblocks in the very near distance – but still nobody outside stopped-clock ‘our year’ Liverpool fans really saw this coming.",
      "Just the simple fact the machinations around the Contract Three have never had any dread impact on the field is impressive. And, yes, getting Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah to be really good is a little bit ‘I told him to do that’ but there have been plenty of new managers before who have come into a settled and successful dressing room and not achieved the level of buy-in from those players to new methods and new ways of doing things.",
      "Still, though, it remains the remodelled midfield that stands as Slot’s greatest achievement. He has elevated Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai to new levels. Each of them had obvious class before this season, but none had shown such a high level for such a sustained period in this league.",
      "It’s not hard to picture plenty of other higher profile managers coming in and finding those the available resources and spending six months whinging about it.",
      "Slot was having none of that, and really has felt like the absolutely ideal kind of coach to come in and take what was already there and provide the small tweaks here and adjustments there to make something even better.",
      "He has, in short, proved the ideal man to finish a necessary rebuild about which Klopp correctly deduced two things. One, that it had to happen but two, that he himself no longer retained the requisite energy to deliver it.",
      "Saying farewell to Klopp was hard, but he knew precisely what he was doing and Liverpool have already reaped the benefits of that.",
      "",
      "Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta has commented on his main mistake from the 2024/25 campaign as he wishes he could “overturn” one “decision”.",
      "Arsenal fans are coming out fighting against all of the nastiness directed towards them and their manager Mikel Arteta, who is not weird.",
      "Mikel Arteta chose the occasion of his pre-match Champions League press conference to denigrate Liverpool’s title. It’s all very odd.",
      "An impending Champions League exit combined with a possible Premier League implosion means heads should roll at Arsenal, with Mikel Arteta first.",
      "Spurs in Norway on an artificial pitch? Nothing to worry about, lads. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta must inspire an Arsenal comeback against PSG.",
      "A former England international turned pundit has criticised Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta for his “stubbornness” in the transfer market on Monday."

      "Wayne Rooney has hailed Harry Kane as “England’s greatest striker,” backing the Bayern Munich man as the Premier League’s finest ever number nine and insisting he should still go on to break Alan Shearer’s long-standing goalscoring record if he returns to English football.",
      "The Man Utd legend was speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Jamie Carragher, and admitted he was “a massive fan” of Kane, not just for his scoring, but his overall evolution as a modern forward.",
      "“He’s definitely up there,” Rooney said.",
      "“I love Harry. I think, as a goalscorer, he’s evolved his game over the last few years as well, which we’ve all seen, in dropping deep, he’s got a good range of passes, he can shoot from outside the box as well.”",
      "Harry Kane is England’s all-time leading scorer with 63 goals, and his 213 Premier League strikes leave him just 47 short of Shearer’s all-time record. It’s a mark Rooney believes he still could hit, if circumstances align.",
      "“If Harry had stayed in the Premier League, he’d break Shearer’s record for sure. Also, if he played for United, he would be considered. He still can. He still should.”",
      "But Rooney didn’t stop there, he doubled down on his belief that Kane is already the Englands best-ever frontman.",
      "“I think he’s England’s greatest striker. Just the goals he’s scored, firstly. But then you look at the games he’s played, the goals he’s scored, he’s just… You just hope. He’s probably got one tournament left in him. You hope he can push us now to that next level.”",
      "Kane’s role for England and his tendency to drop deep drew analysis, too, with Rooney acknowledging that tactical tweaks may have blunted the Three Lions’ attack in past tournaments.",
      "“In the last Euros, you had Harry coming in, you had Bellingham coming in, and they were taking up each other’s space. As a team, Harry should’ve recognised that and said, ‘No, I’m going to play up top.’ At times, you have to do that.”",

Dembele draws level with 2024 champ Gyokeres\nRooney, who scored 208 Premier League goals himself and remains Utd’s all-time top scorer, didn’t just talk about Kane. He lamented the decline of the traditional centre-forward role and said the game has changed to leave modern No. 9s “bored” and uninvolved.",
      "“The game’s changed massively,” he said. “Strikers don’t touch the ball anymore. Goalkeepers and centre-backs have more touches. It’s all build-up now, everything’s precise. You don’t cross the ball anymore, you don’t put it in behind and compete.”",
      "Even Rooney’s son, currently in Man Utd’s academy, has felt it. “He plays as a No. 9 and said to me, ‘It’s boring.’ I keep saying, ‘No, you’re playing as a nine.’ But they’re just not involved in the game as much now.”",
      "That tactical shift is, for Rooney, a reason why only a few true centre-forwards are emerging at the top level.",
      "“You’ve lost natural number nines. I think Isak, Haaland, and Watkins, probably the three standout ones. Rashford’s doing better now, too. But beyond that? Not many.”",
      "Asked who he’d pick as a manager if he needed one striker right now, Rooney was clear. “Haaland. As good as Isak’s been, I think Haaland’s got everything. He’s not the best at heading, his timing’s a bit off, but the goals he’s scored even this season, with injuries, I’d want him.”",
      "And what of the greats of Rooney’s era?",
      "“I always say Drogba. He could head the ball, hold it up, and he was quick, powerful. You could play off him. That’s the kind of striker I liked.”",
      "He added, “Michael Owen (Liverpool) was unplayable for a few years. Ronaldo, R9, had everything. Alan Shearer, Andy Cole, Owen, Sergio Aguero, Thierry Henry… they were incredible. But Kane, for sustainability and goals scored? He’s right up there.”",

He’s always learning, but at the same time, how long will he need to adapt to a new situation?",

      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we looked at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "There’s no Sol Campbell on here because it happened in the before-times, but here’s a list of every club’s biggest free transfer regret if that’s more your bag.",
      "",
      "10) Youri Tielemans (Leicester City to Aston Villa)\n“From the first day I set foot on this ground, your warmth and passion embraced me. Victory and triumph, love, hope and even defeat,” wrote the Belgian midfielder as he confirmed what we had all long knew: He would leave a relegated Leicester City with an FA Cup winner’s medal and the knowledge that he could have done little more to stop the slide from two consecutive top-five finishes to relegation.",
      "In truth, his final year at Leicester was poor after a failed transfer to Arsenal left him ‘mentally gone’. We expected Arsenal to return when he became available on a free transfer in 2023 – it really did feel like a no-brainer – but it was Aston Villa who won that particular race. “The manager was selling me this idea of playing Champions League and I really bought into it,” said Tielemans, who would be playing in Europe’s elite competition a year later.",
      "After a tricky first season in Villa colours, he has since thrived in the Champions League and Premier League, where he has made a good case for making the Premier League XI of the season.",
      "READ: Alexander-Arnold joins list of every Premier League club’s biggest free transfer exit",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (Manchester United to PSG)\nThe Spanish midfielder was reduced to tears on a Manchester United podcast when discussing his exit from the club: “I got the Player of the Year award by the fans and the club didn’t call me that summer to sign a new contract, and they did with other players. That was painful for me, honestly.”",
      "Herrera won the individual gong on the back of United’s most successful post-Sir Alex Ferguson season, in which he played a key role in their League Cup and Europa League titles, and memorably man-marked Eden Hazard out of a clash with Chelsea in perhaps the defining game of his United career.",
      "But the new contract did not arrive that summer and a lame offer as his deal came to a close was comfortably improved by PSG. “There is red in my heart,” said Herrera as he confirmed his departure.",
      "He ranks pretty high in a (largely awful) list of Manchester United transfers post-Fergie.",
      "",
      "8) Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City to…)\n“I don’t know about the future unfortunately. I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don’t do what I do these last four or five weeks,” said Kevin De Bruyne after striking the only goal as Manchester City beat Wolves, taking him to 250 goal involvements under Pep Guardiola.",
      "He has won six Premier Leagues, one Champions League and seven domestic cups (an eighth could come in the FA Cup this month) for City, making him one of the most decorated players in Premier League history.",
      "The Belgian is clearly very upset not to be offered terms by City, meaning his 10-year reign as one of the best midfielders in Premier League history is coming to an end. Or is it? His form in the final weeks of his City stay has prompted some cheeky links with Liverpool, while Aston Villa are said to be very interested.",
      "“Let’s talk about the statue – for me he is Manchester City’s greatest ever player,” said Jamie Carragher. Would the club still build him a statue if he stays in the Premier League? They would probably quite like him to slink over to the semi-retirement of MLS.",
      "",
      "7) Gini Wijnaldum (Liverpool to PSG)\n“What this person – this wonderful, joyful, selfless person – has done for our team and club I cannot sum up in words, in truth, because my English is not good enough,” said Jurgen Klopp as Wijnaldum played his 237th and final game for Liverpool.",
      "The Dutchman had barely stopped running in five years at Anfield which earned him Premier League and Champions League medals, but he fell victim of FSG’s reluctance to hand long contracts to players in their 30s. He wanted to stay and Klopp wanted to keep him – he was ‘perfect’ for Klopp’s system – but a business decision was made.",
      "It seemed that Barcelona would sign Wijnaldum – they are masters of the free transfer swoop – but PSG stepped in to offer twice the money. There he won a French league title but being wonderful, joyful and selfless buttered no parsnips in Paris and he is now in Saudi Arabia playing as a striker.",
      "",
      "6) Emre Can (Liverpool to Juventus)\nIt’s been seven years since we said the free transfer exit of Emre Can from Liverpool should be met with ‘shrugs’, and we were absolutely right. As galling as it always is to allow a player worth £30m-plus to leave for nothing, he was never integral to a Liverpool side building towards Champions League and Premier League glory under Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It helps of course that he was then pretty poor at Juventus (though his career has since been rescued by Borussia Dortmund) while Liverpool brought in Fabinho and immediately won the Champions League. Can was never missed.",
      "",
      "5) Andreas Christensen (Chelsea to Barcelona)\n“Having spent ten amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family,” said the Dane, not so fondly remembered by Chelsea fans after he made himself unavailable to play in the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2022. The decision to leave had clearly affected the form of a player who had won the Champions League the year before.",
      "There was enmity between club and player at the end, with Christensen blamed for twice reportedly reneging on verbal agreements to sign a new contract. He then engaged new agents who wanted to start the whole process again from scratch.",
      "He won the title with Barcelona in his very first season but has been perpetually linked with a return to the Premier League, with the Spanish club likely to accept slightly less than his £430m buy-out clause.",
      "",
      "4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea to Real Madrid)\nIn the same summer that Christensen left, Rudiger also departed Chelsea. And the Blues have been struggling for leadership at the back ever since; they have won nothing since the German left in 2021.",
      "Rudiger admitted that the uncertainty surrounding Chelsea’s ownership and the knock-on effect on player negotiations were a big factor in his exit, saying: “For me, there was a gap between August and January, and that made me think “what’s going on”.",
      "“You get pressure from other teams because it’s January and people don’t know what’s happening and you would have to wait until June because you have a contender to take over the club but even today you cannot talk to him because you have to go through Government stuff and everything.",
      "“I didn’t want to wait until June to sort out my future because it’s been almost a year of uncertainty.”",
      "And nobody can begrudge anybody joining Real Madrid, right?",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal to Juventus)\n“It all happened…I agreed to a contract they proposed,” said Ramsey when attempting to explain why he had left Arsenal after 11 years at the club. He claims that the offer was then retracted as manager Unai Emery decided he wanted to take the club in a different direction.",
      "A few months later Emery was sacked by Arsenal and Ramsey has signed a deal with Juventus that gave him the highest basic salary of any British footballer. But there were few regrets from Arsenal as he never started more than 13 Serie A games in a season for the Italian giants (though he did win a Serie A title) before a loan spell at Rangers and a permanent exit to Nice and then Cardiff.",
      "",
      "2) Paul Pogba (Manchester United to Juventus)\nOnly Manchester United could twice spend money on a mercurial talent and twice watch him walk away for nothing.",
      "‘For a boy that joined the academy at 16 to make over 200 United appearances and lift the Youth Cup, along with two major pieces of silverware, is something that should be applauded and celebrated,’ said Manchester United in a statement that somehow missed out the details of Pogba being allowed to walk away for nothing, re-join for £89m and then leave for nothing again six years later.",
      "Relations between Pogba and the club had long since broken down but the second that Jose Mourinho referred to Pogba as a “virus” should have been the second they began plans to sell him and recoup some of their costs.",
      "He later said that he wanted to leave in the summer of 2019 after his best season for Manchester United because he saw the writing on the wall about the direction of travel but the club denied him an exit; they would live to regret their reticence.",
      "",
      "1) Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to, we presume, Real Madrid)\nOnly perhaps Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi have been more valuable free transfers. He has chosen adventure over comfort after winning everything at Liverpool.",
      "Joe Cole has discussed the best position for Trent Alexander-Arnold at Real Madrid, after listing off four players he will not get in the team ahead of.",
      "Former Liverpool man John Aldridge has warned Trent Alexander-Arnold he’s “going to get annihilated” often when he moves to Real Madrid.",
      "Chelsea will be busy in the ‘exceptional’ early transfer window added for Club World Cup signings, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United affected.",
      "Are Liverpool fans so upset about Trent Alexander-Arnold because it reminds them that this actually does not mean more? Plus, some Inter v Barcelona…",
      "Real Madrid are ready to pay for Trent’s early signing, but Tuchel’s refusal to release players could cause him to miss the Club World Cup.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly looking to get Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his Liverpool contract early in order for him to play at the FIFA Club World Cup."

      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.2\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remain in sniffing distance of a European place.",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.3% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.6\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "6) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "10) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled.",
      "",
      "12) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.9\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "13) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.8\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",
      "",
      "14) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "15) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.8\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -0.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Jordan Pickford this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -2.5\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",

      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2023/24, Arsenal had 31 games televised in the UK, for which they received £26.9m in facility fees. Liverpool had 29 matches and were paid £25.2m, while Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs (all 28 games) were given £24.4m each.",
      "Burnley were shown on the fewest occasions and received £9.3m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",
      "Spurs in 5th (£164.6m) were paid more overall than Villa in 4th (£162.4m), while 8th-placed Manchester United (£156.2m) took home more than 7th-placed Newcastle (£154.7m).",

      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",

      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",

      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",

We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",

If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",
      "P+L = +7.97"
