      "Jadon Sancho helped loan side Borussia Dortmund to reach the Champions League semi-finals with a dramatic victory against Atletico Madrid but might have cost Man United",
      "Jadon Sancho has hailed his Borussia Dortmund teammates for reaching the Champions League semi finals - despite handing Manchester United a huge blow.",
      "The German giants reached the last four on Tuesday evening with a dramatic 5-4 aggregate win against Atletico Madrid. Dortmund were 2-1 down after the first-leg but rallied at home to seal their spot in the semi-finals.",
      "Sancho played 86 minutes of the clash. Taking to social media with his thoughts after the full-time whistle, the on-loan Man United star wrote: “SEMI FINALS! Great fight from the team today!”",
      "Despite his delight, Sancho could have done some serious damage to the Red Devils and Erik ten Hag. Dortmund’s progression sees Germany bolster their chances of earning an additional Champions League spot next season.",
      "As it stands, Italy sit top of the race with their UEFA coefficient standing at 18.428. Germany’s is now 17.214 - and should it remain that way, both countries will earn an additional spot. England are some way off the pace with a coefficient of 16.750. An extra place would certainly have been useful for the Red Devils.",
      "A miserable campaign so far sees them sit seventh in the Premier League - and ten points off of fifth-placed Spurs. No additional spot would mean that they would have to finish fourth, something that is highly unlikely at this stage.",
      "That could see Ten Hag’s position come under severe scrutiny. Minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already emphasised the importance of the club being in the Champions League.",
      "Speaking after sealing his purchase of the side, he said: “We really, really want to get into the Champions League next year - it’s quite important for FFP. It's a two to three season challenge to get the organisation and environment right to produce results.",
      "“Our focus is absolutely on the field, winning football matches, but the first thing is the organisation - the design of the organisation needs to be correct. If you take the example at the moment with the coach reporting to the chief executive, that doesn't make any sense.”",
      "The Red Devils take a break from their Premier League commitments this weekend. They take on Championship side Coventry in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley.",
      "Man United are then back in league action in midweek against struggling Sheffield United ahead of clashes with Burnley and Crystal Palace. Meanwhile, Sancho’s loan side Dortmund will take on newly-crowned champions Bayer Leverkusen this weekend having teed-up a Champions League semi-final with PSG.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Andreas Pereira admits he and several team-mates were convinced Angel Di Maria would help them win the title before his spell at Old Trafford turned sour",
      "Andreas Pereira reckons Angel Di Maria struggled with the pressure of playing for Manchester United before his decision to quit the club after just 12 months.",
      "The World Cup winner, 36, was considered to be one of Europe's elite players when he moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in a then-British record transfer deal back in 2014. The winger failed to settle in Manchester, though, and left the following year after burglars attempted to raid his family home.",
      "Although Di Maria's time at United was short, he left a lasting impression on a young Pereira. Now at Fulham, the 28-year-old recalls that Di Maria made an instant impact in training and that everyone was convinced he would help United would win the league.",
      "Speaking on Vibe with Five, Pereira said: “Di Maria when he arrived from the first session he did. He was unbelievable. He arrived from the Champions League final being the best player. He did the first session and everyone said – seriously, everyone said – we are going to win the league. This guy is amazing.”",
      "While there were mitigating factors behind his decision to leave Manchester after just one season, Pereira went on theorise that the weight of playing for a club like United while wearing the No.7 shirt got to Di Maria.",
      "He continued: “I didn’t know what happened, it was crazy. He didn’t adapt, and then the thing happened with his family, I think this has a big thing to do. [I saw] a big player like this cannot play at United, the pressure is there. It’s difficult to play for United and wear the seven, it’s difficult.”",
      "Di Maria made just 32 appearances for Manchester United before making the move to Paris Saint-Germain, where he stayed for seven years. He joined one of his former clubs, Benfica, in the summer.",
      "Di Maria has spoken extensively on his time in Manchester and the circumstances surrounding his departure. And while he's previously targeted former manager Louis van Gaal, he admits the biggest reason he and his wife left England was simply because they could not settle.",
      "He told Le Parisien: “Honestly, we were not happy. In the beginning, we were a little happy but then things got complicated. Life in England was difficult and it isn't easy for a South American. Some people adapt, but for others, it is harder.",
      "“I didn't get on very well with the coach [either]. So I believe the decision to join Paris was the best solution.”",

      "Fenucci said: “Thiago is working like he had a long-term contract with us. It’s not a problem that he hasn’t yet confirmed his journey with us for the coming years. What bothers me a little is the continuous rumours and the noise around our players. I am not okay with it.",
      "“We are a strong club, one of the most solid in Serie A and we don’t want to change this group in the future. It’s very annoying to see many of our players linked with other clubs, it’s not a nice feeling. However, I am sure this has a limited effect on them as they are all focused on our target and happy to be at Bologna.",
      "“Our club is solid financially thanks to our owner [Joey Saputo], and we have long-term plans for the club’s growth, sporting results, and organisation. We have a long-term vision and financial solidity to continue on this journey.”",
      "On the topic of the Red Devils’ boss, Gary Neville has claimed his future could be decided by how the club do in the FA Cup. Speaking on Sky Sports, he said: \"I don’t think there is anything left to say about some of the league performances that we are witnessing and some of the things that we are watching.",
      "“The tweets, the ‘likes’ and the body language… all that stuff, we have said it so many times before. There is no point going over that again.",
      "“What we can say is that Ten Hag’s future is largely dependent on the FA Cup, because the performance levels in the league have gone. They are like this and they are not going to change now.”",
      "Former Chelsea star Glen Johnson has urged the Blues to move for Man Utd defender Raphael Varane this summer. The ex-Real Madrid centre-back is out of contract this summer.",
      "Speaking to Betfred, Johnson said: \"Good players like that don’t come around often and they certainly come around less often on a free transfer. I know he’s not the Varane he was three or four years ago but he’s still a bloody good player.",
      "\"Yes, he’s had his injury problems but that’s what outweighs the transfer fee – if you’re buying him on a free and he’s only playing 40% of the games, then that’s still a good deal to do,\" he added.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Marcel Sabitzer asserted himself firmly onto the main stage of European football as he helped Borussia Dortmund into the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "The Austrian midfielder recorded two assists in a back and forth quarter-final clash against Atletico Madrid before bagging the all-important winning goal. Sabitzer first unleashed Chelsea loanee Ian Maatsen in the opening half before delivering the cross for Niclas Fullkrug's header that put the German side back on level terms over the two legs.",
      "With 74 minutes on the clock, Sabitzer took a touch to nudge the ball into the box before hitting a left-footed strike past Jan Oblak. Jubilant celebrations unfolded as Sabitzer stormed to the corner of the pitch and over the advertising boards to be joined by teammates from on and off the field.",
      "The 30-year-old's effort ensured a 5-4 scoreline on aggregate and a 4-2 win on the night at the Westfalenstadion. The German side will go on to face Paris Saint Germain in the semi-finals after Barcelona suffered a meltdown in their quarters clash.",
      "Dortmund signed Sabitzer from Bayern Munich for a fee in the region of £16million and has been a regular under Edin Terzic, adding six goals in his 34 appearances this term. Certainly his match-winning performance this evening may have left some at Old Trafford wondering what they missed out on.",
      "Sabitzer spent the latter half of last season helping United secure a Carabao Cup trophy and a place in the Champions League. The Dortmund star has progressed far further than the Red Devils managed after they crashed out bottom of their group before Christmas.",
      "It was in Europe for United too where the midfielder probably delivered his most memorable effort. Sabitzer scored two goals in the first leg of the Red Devil's Europa League clash against Sevilla, but could not help his side progress on that occasion.",
      "\"He was everywhere in the big moments. Everything he touched today, Sabitzer, turned to gold. To be fair you need players to step up in the big moments, Sabitzer was the guy that stepped up and changed the game.\"",

      "Ratcliffe assembled the task force last month to explore the club's options, with the new United co-owner keen to create a 'Wembley of the North'. Mirror Football reported that Ratcliffe had considered revamping Old Trafford, but ultimately decided it would be best to demolish the stadium and rebuild it instead.",
      "The Glazers are understood to have given the project their approval and the task force held their inaugural meeting on Monday to discuss the plans. World Athletics President Lord Sebastian Coe is chairing the task force, which also includes Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and former United captain Gary Neville.",
      "And Lord Coe has now offered an update on the meeting, writing on social media: \"Yesterday, I chaired the first meeting of the Old Trafford Regeneration Task Force to kick off a conversation about how development of a world-class football stadium for the north of England can deliver social and economic benefits for the region.",
      "\"At the London 2012 Olympics, I saw first-hand how sport can be a powerful driver of urban regeneration and I am excited to be part of this project. This meeting marked the start of a multi-stakeholder process to explore options for the stadium and surrounding area.",
      "\"We are at the start of this journey, and it is too soon to know where it will lead. But we will consult closely with fans and local residents along the way, and keep everyone informed of progress.\"",

He said: \"This can be a major regeneration project for an area of Greater Manchester which has played such a key role in British industrial history, but which today requires new investment to thrive again.",
      "\"The north-west of England has a greater concentration of major football clubs than anywhere else in the world, yet we don't have a stadium on the scale of Wembley, the Nou Camp or the Bernabeu. We will not be able to change that on our own, which is why this task force is so important to help us seize this once-in-a-century opportunity.\"",
      "Neville, meanwhile, added: \"Old Trafford has evolved throughout its history and it's clear we are at a point where it has to change again to ensure that Manchester United has a world-class stadium befitting the world’s greatest club.",
      "\"While I want the best for Manchester United, I also want the same for the surrounding community.

      "\"There are no doubts about his qualities. [Riccardo] Calafiori looks interesting as well, but I am accustomed to seeing a Juventus that keeps their best players.",
      "\"I would not sell Bremer, [Federico] Chiesa or [Dusan] Vlahovic. I would only add quality players. I really like Bologna's [Lewis] Ferguson and his injury was a shame.\"",
      "Back in 2020, Greenwood was on Juventus' radar, according to The Athletic, with the 1996 Champions League winners considering a bid for his services.",

      "\"I know that, when I play for this club, I represent the whole academy and I want to repay the faith that my coaches have shown in me with my performances on the pitch. I am learning all the time from the manager and his coaching staff and I know that this is the perfect club to help me reach my potential.\"",

      "Chelsea face an uncertain summer in the transfer market with European qualification still up in the air, but Mauricio Pochettino's club have been urged to add experience",
      "Former Chelsea defender Glen Johnson has followed ex-colleague William Gallas in urging the Blues to raid Manchester United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Gallas, who played for Arsenal and Tottenham after leaving Stamford Bridge in 2006, called on his former club to test United's resolve over high earners Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford. Now, Johnson also wants the London side to add experience, identifying Raphael Varane as a transfer option.",
      "United opted against triggering an extension in Varane's contract midway through the current season. The centre-back, who joined from Real Madrid in 2024, could leave Old Trafford as a free agent in the summer.",
      "The 30-year-old, who is currently sidelined through injury, has been linked with a summer return to Madrid. Johnson, however, wants Chelsea to pounce after a challenging season at the back.",
      "\"Good players like that don’t come around often and they certainly come around less often on a free transfer,\" Johnson told Betfred. \"I know he’s not the Varane he was three or four years ago but he’s still a bloody good player.",
      "\"Yes, he’s had his injury problems but that’s what outweighs the transfer fee – if you’re buying him on a free and he’s only playing 40% of the games, then that’s still a good deal to do,\" he added. Varane has started just 16 league games this season amid various setbacks, but Johnson argued the French international's experience could still prove valuable.",
      "“As we saw with Thiago Silva, those sort of players who have done everything, played for top teams and clubs, they get the attention of the dressing room and they’re the big names that the younger players want to look up to and obviously they’re great to have around,” he continued. “If you have got a chance with Varane on a free transfer and he’s only going to play 50% of the games, I still think it’s a good deal.”",
      "Unlike Varane, Fernandes and Rashford wouldn't come cheap. Despite Chelsea potentially needing to lower their spending in the summer, though, Gallas pointed to the United pair as good fits.",
      "“Both Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes could be good options for Chelsea,\" the Frenchman told Gambling Zone. \"Both are quality players. Bruno could definitely be the kind of midfielder who has the quality to play in the number ten role where Chelsea lack strength.",
      "“Chelsea are a team of young players and Bruno Fernandes has the leadership qualities to get through certain periods. He’d be a good signing if the rumours are true.”",
      "Chelsea and United are both battling it out for a Europa League spot, with Mauricio Pochettino's team keeping their hopes alive by beating Everton on Monday night. Victory for the Blues in their game in hand would see them leapfrog seventh-placed United on goal difference, while drawing level on points with sixth-placed Newcastle.",
      "Pochettino has indicated a need to add experience to his young squad over the summer after dropped points all but ended any hopes of Champions League qualification. The Blues conceded late goals in 2-2 draws with strugglers Burnley and Sheffield United when victories could have put them in better shape for the run-in.",
      "\"We need to bring more young players, we need to bring in some experienced players. But that is all about talking,\" Pochettino said ahead of the Everton game. \"It's about agreeing with the club, analysing and designing the strategy for the next season and to go and fight for big things. That is really important.\"",

      "Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal and Manchester United would be making a mistake if they were to pursue Everton midfielder Amadou Onana in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Toffees midfielder, 22, has been linked with several of the Premier League's elite in recent months and was the subject of interest from the Gunners in January. It's been widely reported that the Belgium international is valued at around £50million.",

      "While it remains to be seen if any of Onana's high-profile suitors are planning a summer swoop, Carragher stressed that he wouldn't be a good signing for top clubs after Everton's humiliating 6-0 loss against Chelsea on Monday night.",
      "The former Liverpool defender told Sky Sports: “I must say this, Onana is a player who Everton may have to sell with the situation that they find themselves in financially.",
      "“He came in with a huge reputation. Frank Lampard brought him in, he looks the part, did really well I think for Belgium at Wembley and there was talk of him going to other big clubs. I don’t see it. I haven’t since he’s been there.",
      "“I don’t know what he is. Is he a holding midfield player? Does he get forward? Does he get involved? The only thing I have seen him do is try to lift the crowd, that is all I ever see him do when he plays for Everton.”",

      "Speaking back in February, via Sport Witness, she said: “We could have left this winter, but we once again sat down and asked the question whether it’s the right time, if the player is ready. My job is to put opportunities on the table.",

      "The Serie A outfit have enjoyed a strong season with Motta, 41, at the helm and the former Paris Saint-Germain midfielder has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, where it remains to be seen if Erik ten Hag will still be in charge next year.",
      "Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team have refused to be drawn on the Dutchman's future since taking control of football operations at the club. Recent reports had indicated Ten Hag was being included for next season, however, there have also been plenty of top coaches linked with the Dutchman's job, including Motta.",
      "Fenucci admitted on Monday that he is \"bothered\" by such speculation but reinforced that the club plan to keep their prized assets, including Joshua Zirkzee. He told Radio Serie A: “Thiago is working like he had a long-term contract with us. It’s not a problem that he hasn’t yet confirmed his journey with us for the coming years. What bothers me a little is the continuous rumours and the noise around our players. I am not okay with it.",
      "“We are a strong club, one of the most solid in Serie A and we don’t want to change this group in the future. It’s very annoying to see many of our players linked with other clubs, it’s not a nice feeling. However, I am sure this has a limited effect on them as they are all focused on our target and happy to be at Bologna.",

      "Gary Neville has claimed that Erik ten Hag's Manchester United future depends on if the club tastes FA Cup glory.",
      "It has been a dismal campaign for the Red Devils, who will almost certainly miss out on Champions League football next term as they languish in seventh with six Premier League games left to play. There is still hope of ending the campaign with some silverware, given United have reached the FA Cup semi-final and will meet Coventry at Wembley on Sunday.",
      "Given Coventry sit a whole league below United, Ten Hag's side are heavy favourites to progress to the final, where they will meet Manchester City or Chelsea. However, failure to do so could spell disaster for the Red Devils boss, at least according to Neville that is.",
      "\"They have to win next weekend. The season would be completely over if they didn’t,\" the former Old Trafford ace told Sky Sports podcast. United have precious little left to play for outside of the FA Cup, given they are 13 points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa.",
      "Neville added: \"I don’t think there is anything left to say about some of the league performances that we are witnessing and some of the things that we are watching. The tweets, the ‘likes’ and the body language… all that stuff, we have said it so many times before.",
      "\"There is no point going over that again. What we can say is that Ten Hag’s future is largely dependent on the FA Cup, because the performance levels in the league have gone. They are like this and they are not going to change now.",
      "“What we’re seeing from United is what we’re going to get for the rest of the season. The players have almost, in some ways, I think, switched off in the league away from home at times. At home they turn it on because they have to, as there are 75,000 people there who won’t allow them to sort of get away from it.\"",
      "United do not come into the clash with Coventry in ideal form. The Red Devils have managed just two league victories since early February and as a result, the pressure is mounting on the manager.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho sparked headlines in the aftermath of Sunday's 2-2 draw away at Bournemouth. The young Argentine was spotted liking tweets that were critical of his manager for substituting the winger at half-time against the Cherries.",

      "Chadwick has gone on to become a bit of a star on TikTok after hanging up his boots. In a Q and A session with fans, the 43-year-old was asked “Which team-mate had the biggest pipe”.",
      "And Chadwick had a hilarious response. Speaking in a video, he said: “Thank you for your question Matt! Tough one to answer, I assume you mean exhaust pipe, and the majority of the lads drove big powerful cars. So the exhaust pipe on the majority of the cars was a decent size, to be honest with you, so it's a tough one to answer.",
      "“I'm really sorry mate, but I don't think I can clarify that. As I said, they all drove really smart cars that had really big exhaust pipes.",
      "“But thank you for the question Matt, it's a really interesting one, I'll have a think and hopefully get back to you at a later date and let you know!”",
      "He captioned the post: “Thanks for the question Matt, I'll always endeavour to answer such important questions!” While Chadwick was not too convinced about revealing ‘personal’ details about his former teammates, he has previously opened up how he found playing alongside personalities such as Roy Keane.",

      "Meanwhile, Bayern enjoyed a 2-0 win of their own over FC Koln, but that was not enough to prevent Bayer Leverkusen from winning the Bundesliga and ending Thomas Tuchel's side's reign of dominance. The Bavarians had won the previous 11 titles.",

      "Lacey isn't the first academy talent to sign his first professional deal this term. Back in December, United confirmed fellow 17-year-old Jaydan Kamason put pen to paper on a deal. The club explained it doesn't announce all such contracts but made an exception for the teenager.",
      "\"While the Academy does not normally announce a player’s first professional contract, an exception has been made in this case to celebrate the success of the Emerging Talent Programme in creating opportunities for children across Greater Manchester to develop their talent,\" a club statement read.",

      "United also handed new deals to youngsters Joe Hugill and Radek Vitek midway through the season. 20-year-old striker Hugill is concluding the campaign on loan at Burton Albion, with goalkeeper Vitek, also 20, getting game time at Accrington Stanley.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho appeared to fire digs at boss Erik ten Hag after Manchester United's draw with Bournemouth and the matter has now been dealt with by the Red Devils boss",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been dealt with “internally” by Manchester United after liking two social media posts criticising boss Erik ten Hag",
      "Garnacho was subbed at half-time of United's 2-2 draw at Bournemouth on Saturday, with Ten Hag critical of the winger's performance in a post-match interview. Argentina star Garnacho appeared to be heading for a major row with Ten Hag after liking the social media posts slamming the United boss for his handling of the 19-year-old.",
      "But Garnacho subsequently unliked both posts, which is understood to have been welcomed by United, the contrition shown by the player said to have avoided a fall-out with Ten Hag.",
      "Yet Garnacho is understood to have been spoken to about the incident and reminded of his responsibilities with regard to social media use and its consequences. Garnacho gave the ball away in the build-up to Dominic Solanke's opener, with Bournemouth's second goal also coming down United's right flank.",
      "What team should Erik ten Hag name vs Coventry in the FA Cup? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "Asked why he took Garnacho off at the break, Ten Hag said United needed to \"repair\" the right side and also suggested the winger was not fully fit, revealing he only trained the day before the game. Jadon Sancho was exiled by Ten Hag after taking to social media to contest his manager's claim he was left out of a game against Arsenal because of poor training performances.",
      "Sancho was banished from the first-team by Ten Hag, forced to train with academy players and was sent out on loan to former club Borussia Dortmund for the rest of the season.",
      "United do not feel the Garnacho incident is anywhere near the level of Sancho in terms of breaching club discipline. Sancho publicly questioned his manager's integrity and accused Ten Hag of lying over his omission from the squad that faced Arsenal.",

      "The £70million-rated defender, understood to be a 'priority' target for United this summer, was in the Everton starting line-up for their trip to Stamford Bridge on Monday evening. By half-time, he'll have wished he hadn't been.",
      "In-form Chelsea talisman Cole Palmer scored a stunning first half hat-trick, while Nicolas Jackson added a fourth as the relegation-threatened Toffees crumbled. And Branthwaite was made to look very foolish by Palmer in the opener.",
      "The England international skipped past Branthwaite, leaving him on the floor after a cheeky nutmeg, and then curled a brilliant effort into the bottom corner. Branthwaite was then caught out of position for Chelsea and Palmer's second.",
      "That triggered Man United fans to share their concern on social media. One fan wrote: \"Anything over 40mil for Branthwaite would be stupid,\" while another said: \"50m of the kings finest for this Branthwaite fella.\"",
      "Red Devils' supporters continued to share their concern throughout the first-half against Chelsea. Another fan said: \"No way this Jarrad Branthwaite guy costs £60mil.\"",
      "Another then claimed: \"Branthwaite just got sent again I don’t rate this guy gives serious Maguire vibes.\"",
      "Branthwaite, 21, has made 35 appearances for Everton this season in all competitions in what has been an otherwise impressive breakout campaign. He has over three years left to run on his current deal amid links with Man United.",

      "Nine months down the line and Onana returned to see familiar faces on Sunday, watching the Italian giants in their 2-2 draw with Cagliari at the San Siro - a result that moved them a step closer to the Serie A title. Onana, a league winner with the club, was asked about his thoughts on the Nerazzurri and whether he regretted quitting the side for Old Trafford.",
      "He was firm on his answer declaring: “I am happy where I am. But I am really happy for Inter, a fantastic team with amazing players and an excellent coach. It’s thrilling to think about what we achieved together last season.",
      "“Inter is a family for me, I love the fans. I wish them all the best. Regrets? No, I’m happy at Manchester United. But I’m so happy for Inter, the club is incredible, and this team is fantastic.”",
      "Onana’s return comes as Inter inch towards the Italian title. He revealed that the reason for his visit was to wish his former side all the best.",
      "“That’s why I came here,” he added. “I won’t be able to be here next week, so I came today to congratulate them. It’s a historic moment for Inter, and I am really happy for the team, which has worked incredibly well this season. I hope they continue to win in the next few years.”",
      "While Inter are on their way towards yet another Serie A crown, Man United’s form has suffered this term. The 2-2 draw with Bournemouth leaves Erik ten Hag's side in seventh and while a top four finish is still mathematically possible, it seems highly unlikely.",
      "Onana’s own form has also fluctuated this term. He made a series of costly errors earlier in the campaign. The 28-year-old has also conceded an eye-watering 68 goals this term in all competitions.",

      "The Palace goalkeeper helped the Eagles secure a stunning win at Liverpool as he continues to enjoy time in between the sticks. Henderson quit Manchester United and moved to Selhurst Park in the summer in an effort to further his career and is now enjoying the fruits of that.",
      "Henderson once had ambitions to become the No 1 at Old Trafford but was continuously snubbed and then had to deal with injury problems that have tested the 27-year-old's resolve. He's now played 12 of the last 16 league games with another Three Lions cap on his radar",
      "He said: “It’s not as lonely as the last 11 months have been. I’ve been to hell and back, getting injury after injury and with things not quite working out. I’m happy now I’m back playing. That’s a big tick. I’d love to go in any capacity. I’ll go and save shots, try and save penalties, help England out in any way. I’ll get the nod hopefully.”",
      "Henderson first began impressing when he enjoyed a two-year spell at Sheffield United. Towards the latter end of 2020, when he was back in Manchester, he landed his only England cap and now wants to go as Gareth Southgate's third-choice goalkeeper behind Jordan Pickford and Aaron Ramsdale.",
      "The Eagles shotstopper said: “Why not? When I was fit in the past, I’ve always been in the England set-up - you don’t become a bad keeper overnight. Sometimes you need a block of work to get back to your best. Obviously, I’ve got a block of work in there now, and I’m starting to get back to my best.”",
      "Henderson eventually began to manufacture his exit from United, where he felt he deserved more of a chance to be first choice. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer continued to overlook him despite calls to drop David de Gea and the Englishman quickly secured his departure before Erik ten Hag rocked up, signing on loan with Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Palace goalkeeper claimed it was \"criminal\" for United to treat him the way they did - after he'd turned down moves away to pursue opportunities that never came to fruition.",
      "He told talkSPORT: \"I didn't want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training. I knew he'd probably want to keep me, so I tried to do it all before I left for the season. I told all the hierarchy I need to go and play football, I don't want to be here playing second fiddle.\"",

      "Manchester United's latest insipid offering at Bournemouth at the weekend underlined the scale of the task facing Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team in their bid to take the broken club back to the top.",
      "Ratcliffe and his INEOS team, led by former British cycling guru Sir Dave Brailsford, have already set about restructuring the personnel leading the football operations side at United.",
      "Former chief executive Richard Arnold has gone, to be replaced by ex Manchester City CEO Omar Berrada. Football director John Murtough also went last week, with Dan Ashworth set to take up his role once compensation can be agreed with Newcastle. Jason Wilcox is set to join him as technical director, once a similar financial settlement is reached with Southampton.",
      "One of the biggest tasks facing the new team in charge of the football side at United is ridding the squad of the dead wood that continue to deliver mediocre performances every week. As many as 12 players could – and should – be offloaded this summer, as part of a radical overhaul of the squad.",
      "There is a case for moving on Victor Lindelof, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Raphael Varane, Casemiro, Scott McTominay, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Antony, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, as well as Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho, both currently out on loan.",
      "Of course, shifting half of the squad and replacing them all in one transfer window is unrealistic, but the number of players who need to be shipped out, simply because they are not good enough, says everything about the abysmal recruitment policy that has blighted United in recent years.",
      "If United manage to get rid of three-quarters of those players this summer, that will constitute a successful window, with upgrades brought in to begin the process of building a squad that is fit for purpose and capable of performing on a consistent basis, rather than sporadically or when it suits them.",
      "Casemiro is a case in point. A five-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, his experience and leadership was crucial last season in hauling United back into the Champions League and landing a first trophy for six years, but he has regressed and has become a liability rather than an asset.",
      "Varane, also signed from Real, brought similar qualities with him, but is too injury-prone and is currently sidelined again. If he does not play again this season, he will have averaged 19 Premier League starts per season over his three years at United, underling his lack of reliability.",
      "United have a core that can thrive if complemented by better players, in Andre Onana, Lisandro Martinez, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund, while young defender Willie Kambwala has also shown what a promising prospect he is for the future, even if he was at fault for Bournemouth's opener in Saturday's 2-2 draw.",
      "But the first task for the new regime at United is to jettison those players on exorbitant wages who the club have struggled to move on in the past, and generate funds that can be reinvested in the squad.",
      "That is something neighbours Manchester City have excelled at over the past decade – not only do they buy well, they sell well. If Ratcliffe and co are serious about re-establishing United as a major force, domestically and in Europe, that is an area that has to be improved – starting this summer.",

      "Paul Mitchell has been linked. He has four years at Spurs with a good recruitment record including Son Heung-min and worked with Red Bull Leipzig and Monaco. Former player Hugo Viana and Paolo Maldini have also been linked, suggesting an interest, and a net spread around Europe.",
      "Eddie Howe wants to keep all his best players “for as long as possible.” But it is not a media generated story that Newcastle could be a big seller as well as big buyers in the summer. Chief exec Darren Eales admitted earlier in the year that Newcastle are walking a PSR tightrope.",
      "Isak and Guimaraes are world class. Newcastle are an upper mid-table squad without their star quality and ability to make a goal.",

      "Guimaraes is a diamond too. A great fitness record, a scrapper in midfield, but also the play-maker. He’d fit into Man City’s team, but PSG may be interested.",
      "It would be a massive statement to keep both this summer, perhaps bigger than signing another £60m star. Especially with Sandro Tonali to come back after his ban.",
      "A priority is a centre back, or two, a versatile striker, an athletic midfield enforcer-type and possibly changes at goalkeeper.",
      "Bournemouth’s out of contract Lloyd Kelly is a target for cover left centre back, with Sven Botman and Jamaal Lascelles out for 6-9 months. Newcastle need cover up front, with Callum Wilson ’s injury record. They could also shake up their keeper department with Nick Pope ’s shoulder dislocations a worry and Aaron Ramsdale not playing at Arsenal.",

      "Man United are expected to sign a midfielder in the summer and Kobbie Mainoo has named his perfect partner.",
      "\"Hmmm, I'd say Scholes, although there might not be a lot of defending happening between the two of us,\" said Kobbie Mainoo when asked to name his perfect midfield partner.",
      "Mainoo was given a choice between Manchester United players from the past and present and picked Scholes for his 'passing, movement, intelligence and the way he could finish'.",
      "The 18-year-old is an articulate young man and smiled when suggesting that, although he'd love to play with Scholes, the pairing would probably be too attack-minded.",
      "Sources close to Mainoo have likened him to a student of the game and he understands the midfield would be left compromised with two No.8s playing together, especially when considering that Bruno Fernandes would be ahead of them in his attacking midfield position.",
      "A midfield of Scholes, Mainoo and Fernandes would be perfect in a FIFA video game, but it wouldn't work in reality because that trio would leave the backline exposed. Fernandes plays in an advanced position, Scholes had an eye for goal and Mainoo's future lies in the No.8 role due to the quality he can provide in attacking scenarios.",
      "Mainoo was far from prolific in the academy - his goals were often scrappy - but he's got the skillset to score frequently and he's already notched a few for the first team.",
      "His goals against Newport County in the FA Cup and Wolves in the Premier League were brilliant, but his strike in the 2-2 draw with Liverpool was a moment of class.",
      "Not only that, Mainoo's ability to unlock defences with pinpoint accuracy is a huge asset and asking him to play deep would be wasting and miss-profiling his talent.",
      "Make no mistake, Mainoo is not a defensive midfielder and while he's played a deeper role on occasions this season, he's certainly not the replacement for Casemiro.",
      "A source recently told the MEN that Mainoo 'loves to play with Casemiro' because the Brazilian's defensive discipline gives him the licence to take up more advanced positions. Mainoo is seen to best effect when playing in a more advanced midfield role and United must sign a Casemiro replacement this summer to help him reach his potential.",
      "Interestingly, Sir Jim Ratcliffe was also recently asked which former United player he'd bring into the team and he named Scholes. \"Paul Scholes I'd bring in. That's the player that is most missing,\" said the British billionaire without hesitation on the Cycling Club podcast.",
      "\"They are not Roy Keane but they have Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, they are more defensive. They don't have a Scholes, an [Andres] Iniesta.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has watched football all his life, he's supported United since he was a boy and is entitled to his opinion, but suggesting Mainoo is more defensive probably shows it's a good job he's employing the best-in-class to make key decisions instead of making them himself.",
      "The 71-year-old loves football, United and, importantly, has the self-awareness to employ some of the leading brains in the industry, which has been refreshing.",
      "United have required a reset and Ratcliffe is overseeing it. He is giving the club the best chance of succeeding with board room appointments and they will dictate transfer policy.",
      "High on the agenda this summer will be addressing Casemiro's future and if a world-class player in that mould can be signed, then Mainoo will continue to blossom. The youngster is a talent worth building the midfield around - but he needs support.",

      "Monster Man United summer transfer move is needed - and Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a big call to make",
      "With just over a month of the Premier League campaign remaining, it is hardly surprising that more and more transfer speculation is starting clog up the online gossip columns.",
      "One of the biggest stories to have surfaced so far this week has been a report claiming Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has 'met' super agent Jorge Mendes and 'discussed' the possibility of signing two of his clients ahead of this summer - Benfica's Joao Neves and AC Milan forward Rafael Leao.",
      "United have been heavily linked with Neves' signature in recent months while Leao has been linked with a move to Old Trafford at various stages in his career. According to Portuguese newspaper Record, United plan to make 'two blockbuster signings' this forthcoming summer.",
      "The upcoming transfer window, of course, will mark an important juncture in United's history. Following Ratcliffe's investment in February, Ineos now oversee all football-related activity at the club and recruitment is going to play a fundamental role in their quest to take the club forward.",
      "Fresh links connecting United with Leao, however, are somewhat difficult to get onboard with. The Portuguese international, who is a highly versatile forward, has been around for sometime, despite only being 24, and would almost certainly command a fee in excess of £100million in the current market.",
      "United, this forthcoming summer, are unlikely to prioritise the addition of a winger, which is Leao's natural position, though speculation continues to surround the future of Marcus Rashford. Instead, United need to try and focus as much of their energy as possible on recruiting a successor for Casemiro.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo's development means he will almost certainly be a shoo-in in United's strongest midfield next season, while it is hard to imagine Bruno Fernandes losing his place anytime soon. It means the stage is set for United to recruit a new defensive-midfielder, who can provide discipline and a strong element of control, to complement the qualities of both Mainoo and Fernandes.",
      "Neves, who does not turn 20 until November, has been regularly linked with a move to M16 in recent months and reports coming out of Portugal have stated he has been identified as United's 'top target' to strengthen their midfield. Despite his age, he has embedded himself as a key figure at Benfica this season, making 50 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Benfica, primarily, operate with a 4-2-3-1 system and Neves occupies one of the two defensive-midfield berths in front of the back-four. As well as being happy to roll up his sleeves and contribute the dirty side of the game, he is also happy to distribute the ball from deep and make progressive carries.",
      "Looking at United's midfield as it is now, Casemiro has often been too exposed, with Mainoo's hunger to get forward and support the attacking play leaving the Reds somewhat vulnerable. Mainoo is displaying the hallmarks of a progressive No.8 and not a dominant No.6, whose main focus is on tackling and doing the ugly stuff.",
      "It means United need to nail their recruitment of a new No.6, who can dominate the midfield enough to allow Mainoo to push high in support of Fernandes. Erik ten Hag, as was proven with his pursuit of Frenkie de Jong two years ago, wants a midfielder who can control possession and dictate.",
      "Neves boasts a 90 per cent passing accuracy in Primeira Liga this season and has completed 61 per cent of attempted dribbles, suggesting he does have it in his locker to do more than provide defensive solidity. While the standard of the Portuguese top flight is not as high as the Premier League, he has already been backed to perform at the 'highest level'.",
      "Former Benfica scout Boto, speaking to Record last year, said: \"I'm not surprised that all the big European clubs are paying attention, Benfica could earn a lot of money in the future with his sale. There's no doubt in my mind that, regardless of Benfica's season, he'll be worth a lot at the end of the year.",
      "\"At his age, he combines talent with impressive dynamism in midfield and above-average maturity, something he demonstrates with every performance he makes. He shows that he's ready to play at the highest level and has a huge scope for progression. He's a player who impresses and whose faults are hard to find.\"",

      "Such is Neves' profile and the steep trajectory he is on at such a young age, a move for his signature will not be cheap to facilitate. He is under contract until 2028 and is release clause is reportedly worth €100m, which converts to around £86m.",
      "Back in January, Benfica denied they had entered into talks with United about signing the start, even going as far as issuing a statement which read: \"Benfica denies the existence of any right of preference over its player Joao Neves. Under no circumstances did Benfica enter into talks with Manchester United or any other club about this player - nor does it intend to do so. Any information that points in another direction is false.\"",
      "That was then, however, and things change. United's need for reinforcements this summer - especially in midfield - will see them move for someone.",
      "There's little doubt that Neves would provide aggression and ball-playing expertise to United's midfield, providing them with two qualities they desperately need. Whether the price of clinching his signature - given their need to box clever in the summer market - proves too much is what Ratcliffe & Co must weigh up - with a little help, no doubt, from a super agent.",

      "Cox said:",
      "\"I am extremely proud of what Adam Lawrence, the staff and the players have achieved this season. The players have been stretched, with exposure to numerous competitions and age-group games, whilst also supporting the first-team. They have consistently risen to each challenge that we have intentionally designed for them and accomplished something really special together. Individual player development is always our primary aim but competing to win under pressure is vital. Both of those objectives have certainly been achieved across the board. Our academy programme creates life changing experiences, and this group of players and staff will remember this achievement wherever their careers take them .\"",
      "\"Signing a striker was United's main priority in last summer's transfer window, but there is an argument to suggest strengthening in midfield once again will take priority this time around. Casemiro's decline means the club is crying out for a new No.6 to slot in alongside Kobbie Mainoo. It is unlikely that fulfilling that mission will come cheap, meaning United are going to have to box clever to strengthen other parts of their squad. The full-back and centre-back departments are also in need of attention. Though there is no doubt United need another striker, Rasmus Hojlund's addition to the squad last summer for an initial fee of £64million means they are unlikely to spend a similar amount on a second goal-getter in as many years. United are going to have to be mindful of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules [PSR] this summer and know they need to generate funds through sales.\"",

      "\"United splashed the cash to sign a raw Rasmus Hojlund in a deal worth £72million last summer, although ideally, another striker would have been signed to support him. Hojlund has vast potential and he enjoyed a brilliant start to 2024, scoring six league goals, but another forward is needed this summer, especially with Marcus Rashford's goals having dried up and Anthony Martial finally set for a departure upon the expiry of his contract. Rodrigo Muniz could be the perfect signing for United. He's got two years left on his contract with Fulham and perhaps a bid in the region of £40million would be enough to land him. Fulham would be reluctant to part ways with Muniz, with Aleksandar Mitrovic only leaving last summer, but the player's head could be turned by an approach from United.\"",

While nothing can be assured about United's transfer plans ahead of the summer, such are levels of uncertainty, it is difficult to imagine them swooping for Leão.",
      "He is likely to command a fee of £100million-plus and signing a winger should not be a top priority for United as things stand. Instead, they should be putting more focus on signing a midfielder and a centre-back.",
      "As talented as Leão is, and he would add quality to United's forward line, a move for him does not feel as though it is either likely or wise. United have bigger priorities this forthcoming summer and splashing out more than £100m on a winger does not feel sensible.",

      "The German side came from 2-1 down in the first leg to beat Atletico Madrid 5-4 on aggregate. Goals from Julian Brandt, Ian Maatsen, Niclas Fullkrug, and Sabitzer gave them a 4-2 win on the night which was enough to see them through.",
      "The winning goal came just a few days after the 30-year-old scored both of the team’s goals in a 2-1 Bundesliga win over Borussia Monchengladbach and was his sixth strike of the season. Not only did Sabitzer score the winning goal, he also provided assists for two teammates during the game, meaning he played a part in three of the four Dortmund goals.",
      "His performance may leave United fans and Erik ten Hag thinking what could have been. The midfielder only completed a transfer to Dortmund in the summer after spending some time on loan at Old Trafford.",
      "Sabitzer joined United on a six-month loan from Bayern Munich in January 2023. He made 18 appearances for the club, scoring three times and providing one assist, two of those goals came in the Europa League quarter-final first-leg draw against Sevilla, United went on to lose the second leg 3-0.",
      "After joining Dortmund on a permanent deal in the summer, the midfielder delivered a verdict on his short spell at United. “I remember a lot of things from my time at Manchester United,\" he told Dortmund’s club media.",
      "“I was very impressed by the fact of having played for a club of such stature. I had a smile every day at the thought of being there and playing.",
      "“It's also because I had playing time [at United] that I found my rhythm and my self-confidence. I showed good things there and that has an impact because a year and a half ago everyone doubted me. When you can prove again that you can play a part in big clubs like this, it's good for confidence.”",
      "Later, in an interview with the Athletic back in November, Sabitzer had specific praise for Ten Hag and his tactical knowledge. “You can wake him up at 3am, he’d tell you his whole match plan by heart,\" he said.",
      "\"He’s very knowledgeable about football and tactics — a very hard worker, a perfectionist. And he’s very straight with you. When I had a bad game, he showed me some situations and told me how to do it better next time. I liked that.",
      "\"You knew where you stood with him. He never threw you under the bus. Instead, he told players to go out and do better in the next game. I learned a lot about football working under him. He’s a very good coach.”",
      "The loan move to United looked like it would be made permanent in the summer, only for injury to cut Sabitzer’s season short. The midfielder revealed how he tried to play through the pain to make the move happen.",
      "“I already picked up the injury two weeks into my stay and then played through the pain because I wanted to make it work,” he said. “But at one point, I couldn’t go on any more and had to have surgery.",

      "Man United manager Erik ten Hag is under increased scrutiny between now and the end of the season after a poor campaign",
      "Former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce believes there is a good chance Erik ten Hag is part of the plan at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dutch manager is under heavy scrutiny at the moment following a disappointing season. United crashed out of the Champions League in embarrassing fashion and did not put up much of a better showing in the Carabao Cup.",
      "United have fallen completely out of the race for Champions League qualification through the Premier League and their only glimmer of hope this season is the FA Cup. Ten Hag now faces a battle to keep hold of his position at Old Trafford and MEN Sport understands Sir Jim Ratcliffe is unconvinced by the current boss.",
      "However, despite the negatives this season, Bruce believes he has seen evidence of why Ten Hag's position is safe. He told talkSPORT: \"It certainly sounds, by his interview, that they have (a plan for Ten Hag to stay).",
      "\"There is certainly a plan in place above him. They have put in structures above him.",
      "\"I know people are on gardening leave but I am sure, by the summer, it will be resolved. Dan Ashworth, the new CEO (Omar Berrada), the kid from Southampton (Jason Wilcox).",
      "\"It looks as if there is a plan in place. Certainly, by the sounds of Ten Hag, he feels like he’s part of it and I genuinely hope he is given a chance under the new ownership.",
      "\"The big thing I think, for all Man United fans, is recruitment and how they improve that. There’s no doubt that they have spent a hell of a lot of money.",
      "\"However, have they got it right with the type of player you have to be to play for Man United? Man United sets the highest standards. You’re under intense scrutiny and, by the way, so is the manager.",

      "\"Ten Hag, I hope they will go with him and put the people in place above him to drive the club forward. But they’ve got a hell of a work ahead of them.\"",

      "The 28-year-old was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford during the January transfer window following an astonishing campaign in the Bundesliga. However, United were not in a position to spend this winter, and Guirassy's stint at AFCON ensured he remained in Germany.",
      "Since returning to his domestic club, Guirassy has continued to shine and has scored in his last six Bundesliga appearances, including a brace in the victory over Wolfsburg. The forward has 27 goals to his name this season, and according to Sport Bild, United are ready to pounce in the summer.",
      "It is believed a £17m release clause remains active in Guirassy's contract, but United will face a battle to complete a deal with West Ham, who are also thought to be keen. As one striker is pursued to move to Old Trafford, another is set to leave.",
      "Anthony Martial may not play for the Reds again after suffering a groin injury in January. The Frenchman's contract expires at the end of the campaign, and it is widely believed his deal will not be renewed.",

The Reds' stadium has been in desperate need of modification for several seasons, with new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe making it one of his key priorities when he joined the club last year.",

      "Man Utd have suffered a disastrous season and Erik ten Hag has seen his squad decimated by injuries, but two players thrown in at the deep end have thrived.",
      "Searching for positives in this Manchester United season is becoming increasingly difficult. You could probably make a case for Andre Onana, perhaps for Rasmus Hojlund. The FA Cup could yet prove unexpected salvation. But the legacy of this campaign will be what it delivers in years to come, as Erik ten Hag touched on recently.",
      "The injury crisis that has plagued United almost constantly this term has limited Ten Hag's options, but it's also offered up opportunities to youngsters and for the last two weeks United have fielded three teenagers in their starting XI, with Willy Kambwala joining Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho in the team.",
      "Garnacho's promise has simply been fulfilled this season and for all that his social media activity on Saturday caused a stir, that was the 30th successive game he has started in all competitions. Ten Hag deserves credit for allowing the Argentine's talent to shine and he deserves even more credit for throwing Mainoo in at the deep end and allowing him to swim.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional this season and is now a more vital cog in that midfield than Casemiro. He would have played more often but for the ankle injury sustained against Real Madrid in pre-season.",
      "But if Garnacho's involvement was a given and Mainoo's opportunities were also on the cards, it has come sooner than expected for Kambwala, who has been the beneficiary of a defensive injury crisis that has rarely abated.",
      "The French teenager isn't the real deal yet but then which 19-year-old centre-back is? He has also come into a team that offers such little protection to their defence that the position should come with its own health warning.",
      "On a couple of occasions against Liverpool and Bournemouth, he was dragged deep into opposition territory because Diogo Dalot was out of the game. He won a ferocious duel with Luis Diaz on one occasion but was too easily bypassed at the weekend for another Cherries counter.",
      "He found it difficult to keep Dominic Solanke quiet on the south coast, but he isn't the only Premier League centre-back to struggle with that assignment this season. He was left isolated against Solanke for the first goal after United's wretched attempts to play out from the back and then slipped at a crucial moment.",
      "But generally, he has defended well. His recovery pace against Darwin Nunez at Old Trafford was exceptional and he has been trusted in the build-up, perhaps too much given the lack of structure when United play out has left him short of passing options.",
      "Ten Hag was asked about Kambwala after his performance against Liverpool and spoke about how positive the future is with the players coming through at Old Trafford.",
      "\"When old soldiers die, new ones have to come in,\" explained Ten Hag. \"Willy for a long time is training with us, he started at West Ham and did very good, his progress is amazing, we didn’t have any doubts.",
      "\"We were convinced he could do the job, it’s another signal and message for the future of Manchester United. This team and squad has high potential. The future will be very good.\"",
      "Whether Ten Hag gets to oversee that future is looking more and more unlikely. If he is replaced this season then the next man in charge will be thankful to inherit talent of the quality of Kambwala, Mainoo and Garnacho.",
      "The development of the first two this season is a major bonus ahead of what is shaping up to be a testing summer. United are going to miss out on the revenue that comes with Champions League football and are still battling concerns over the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "The emergence of Kambwala will mean United can use the youngster to fill the fourth or fifth centre-back slot in the squad, rather than using some of their transfer budget on signing a more experienced option. That will be vital in what is expected to be a summer of upheaval at the back, with Jonny Evans and Raphael Varane out of contract and the future of Harry Maguire still uncertain.",
      "United will still pursue another centre-back and depending on the future of Casemiro, a holding midfielder might be necessary as well, but in Mainoo they have a player of real quality to fill one of the starting midfield slots already.",
      "A year ago neither Kambwala nor Mainoo had made the step up. Now, both look ready to be part of the first-team squad. That is likely to be a £100million saving, at least, in the transfer market and after a disappointing season on the pitch, it's the kind of bonus that is badly needed ahead of the summer.",

      "In a bid to change that, United drafted in Rasmus Hojlund from Atalanta last summer, bringing an end to their long-term pursuit of a new striker. The youngster has improved as the season has unfolded and currently has a respectable 13 goals to his name.",
      "At the other end, however, United have not been as solid and reliable defensively, conceding more goals in the league so far this season than they did in the whole of last term. Unfortunately, their vision of increasing their attacking output while remaining solid defensively has not come to fruition.",
      "But when you consider the unprecedented amount of injuries United have encountered at the back, it is not exactly surprising, is it? Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane, who formed the Reds' strongest centre-back partnership last season, missed Saturday's trip to Bournemouth, as did Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans.",
      "It meant youngster Willy Kambwala, who performed so admirably against Liverpool just over a week ago, partnered Harry Maguire in the heart of the back-four once again. The former, who is 19, has provided glimpses of his capabilities and potential when opportunities have presented themselves, with his latest start marking his ninth appearance of the campaign.",
      "It has been proven throughout Ten Hag's premiership that he will only the door for youngsters to prove their worth if he believes they are genuinely good enough to play for the first-team, which is why he has not been immune to putting square pegs in round holes in the past when there has been a like-for-like replacement available within the ranks. Kambwala, despite being given an acid test by Dominic Solanke at the Vitality Stadium, has offered signs of promise.",
      "Ahead of this summer's transfer window, which promises to be massively intriguing, work needs to be done in United's centre-back department. Varane and Evans are out-of-contract and the futures of both Maguire and Lindelof are not guaranteed.",
      "Only Martinez, who has missed almost all of this season due to injury, is guaranteed a starting berth in the heart of the back-four. As talented and important as he is when fit, Varane's injury record means it feels inevitable that United will make the decision to cut ties this summer.",
      "Should they decide to release him, replacing him will become one of Ineos' main transfer tasks. Everton's Jarrad Branthwaite is on United's radar and they are continuing to be closely linked with Juventus ace Gleison Bremer and Jean-Clair Todibo of Nice as potential replacements.",
      "Provided Martinez can remain fit, it is highly likely a new centre-back will partner him in Ten Hag's first-choice centre-back paring. Beyond that, Maguire or Lindelof, on the presumption one of them is sold this summer, will compete for third in the pecking order, with competition coming from Evans, if retained.",
      "Evans has done well this season and it would be no great surprise to see him offered a one-year extension, despite the fact he is 36. Even if he occupies fifth in the pecking order and does not end up playing as often as he has this season, he would not be the worst option in the world to have within the ranks.",
      "That leaves fourth in the pecking order, a role Kambwala is putting himself in the frame to potentially scoop and push Maguire or Lindelof, even despite his tough Saturday evening. Many feel United could require two centre-back signings this summer, but Kambwala's development could mean only one is needed, though Evans' future will dictate the possibility of a second signing.",
      "Kambwala will get more opportunities this season, despite a bit of a horror show at the Vitality Stadium. To help him develop and impress, however, he needs more support from the players around him. While his slip for Solanke's goal, and his decision-making over Justin Kluivert's strike were highlighted, the fact is that the normally reliable Diogo Dalot didn't give him adequate help. Nor did Maguire, not getting round on the cover quick enough for the first goal on Saturday evening.",
      "Then there is the midfield. Too often, Bournemouth players were able to get at the centre of United's defence too easily, after the visitors either surrendered possession cheaply or didn't track runners. Casemiro, another experienced players, needs to do more to protect Kambwala.",
      "Ten Hag admitted as much post-match, saying: \"The first goal we were actually well set up but we lose the ball in a bad area and it was a goal. There were two or three more occasions where we should have dealt better with the ball.",
      "\"Then down the right side they were finding ways to hurt us and there were jobs to be done but it was not always done. Then you get problems. Go with your opponent, that is your job. One part is collaboration and the other is discipline.",
      "\"Second half was better. We took more responsibility and we closed up the sides. That also has to do with in the middle Harry Maguire was struggling in the first half, and you see we don't have many options at centre-half any more. But in the second half his leadership and guidance helped us to be more closed.\"",
      "Ultimately, Kambwala's development means he could become a staple in United's back four in years to come if his volume of minutes continue to increase next season, in cup matches, for example. It is in United's DNA to promote from within and their management of Kambwala could result in them being able to reserve funds for alternative projects this summer.",

      "Marcus Rashford had been linked with a move to French giants Paris Saint-Germain earlier this year while plans to sign a new defender are claimed to be underway",

      "PSG failed to lure Rashford to Paris last summer and he subsequently signed a lucrative new deal. But rumours kicked up a gear in January after the 26-year-old missed United's 4-2 win over Newport County in the fourth round of the FA Cup due to illness, having being spotted in a Belfast nightclub earlier that week.",

      "Rashford has struggled to make a real impact for Erik ten Hag's team and match his sizzling form of last season. He has 13 goal contributions in 39 games in all competitions.",
      "Elsewhere, Caught Offside add that United have held 'concrete talks' to sign Bayer Leverkusen defender Jeremie Frimpong as Aaron Wan-Bissaka looks likely to leave this summer. The 26-year-old is approaching the final 12 months of his contract and has been linked with a move to Inter Milan.",
      "Frimpong has been in fine form during Leverkusen's remarkable season which has seen them win the Bundesliga title for the first time in the club's history. He has been a vital part of how the German club play, helping link defence and attack in impressive fashion.",
      "Liverpool are also admirers of the defender and Frimpong has opened the door to joining the Reds in the past. Speaking to Soccer News via Ziggo Sport, he said: \"Liverpool? Great club, with history. That would be great. Who knows what the future will bring.\"",

      "Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth showcased an ongoing concern.",
      "Although Manchester United have conceded at least 20 shots in nine of their last 10 games in the Premier League, Erik ten Hag has played down the problem.",
      "Only Luton Town (576) have conceded more shots than United (574) and that openness naturally increases the opposition's chances of finding the back of the net. Bournemouth took the lead twice against United at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday and would have been out of sight in the first half if they'd converted their early chances.",
      "The points were shared and the result meant United have four points fewer after 32 games this season than they did under David Moyes in 2013/14, which is damning.",
      "Ten Hag admitted that a lot of the problems at the Vitality Stadium came down the right side in the first period, something he tried to rectify at half-time. And after the game, right-back Diogo Dalot spoke to the Manchester Evening News and was asked about the worrying rate of chances United have conceded this season.",
      "Unlike his manager, he admitted it was a problem. Interestingly, the full-back also highlighted the space between the defensive line midfield as an issue that needed to be solved.",
      "\"I think it’s a fact, something we are looking for. Maybe we are taking too many risks, sometimes the gap between the defence and midfield is a little bit too big,\" said Dalot.",
      "\"This is why we are sometimes getting the counter-attacks too many times and are conceding too many shots, but overall we are looking forward to taking this as a learning process and trying to do better.",
      "“I’m disappointed. We wanted to come here and get the three points. We were down twice, so we had the hunger to fight for the game. I think we lost control in situations we shouldn’t and that was the script of the match.",
      "\"I mean, we lost a little bit of control, especially building up from the back in situations where we shouldn’t and we conceded two goals in the first half - we could have avoided that, but overall we have the attitude to fight for the result and that’s a positive to take away.\"",
      "Willy Kambwala started again for United and, unfortunately, had a difficult evening against the physically imposing Dominic Solanke, who scored the first goal after the teenager slipped on the surface.",
      "However, the youngster impressed with his performance in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool and has done well coming into an inconsistent team at a high-pressure stage of the season.",
      "\"Obviously, that’s one of the things I try to do more now, even more,\" Dalot said when asked about his role in the dressing room and helping Kambwala.",
      "\"I think Willy has done a fantastic job coming into the team when we needed him. It’s not easy to come in such a difficult time, but he’s a great character, a great personality and I’m sure he’ll very successful at this club.\"",
      "United play Championship club Coventry in the semi-finals of the FA Cup next. The travelling support has sung about Wembley on each away day over the last few weeks and remaining in the competition has provided a glimmer of hope in a bleak campaign.",
      "\"It’s a huge opportunity for us [semi-final against Coventry] and it’s where we wanted to be - a chance to make the FA Cup final,\" Dalot said about next weekend's clash.",
      "\"We have one game to be there and it has to be the same attitude and energy we should have done throughout this season and the motivation has to be there because we want to be in the final, we want to win it. It’s going to be a huge game for us.\"",
      "United's players have dropped like flies with injury problems this season but Dalot has always been available, taking extra measures to manage his body and recovery.",
      "\"Trying to do my best, my recovery, I try to always do what I can to always be available physically and mentally,\" he said. \"I try to help the team. I do a lot of things.\"",

      "Instead, it is now in great danger of marking the moment where their season peaked. Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth saw United produce another limp performance that was fortune to earn a point.",
      "Erik ten Hag's side were second best at the Vitality Stadium, offering next to nothing in attack outside of the moments that led to Bruno Fernandes bagging a first brace of the season. The Reds, who were unchanged from the 2-2 draw with Liverpool six days earlier, were bereft of ideas, performing like a team who are already on the beach.",
      "That type of performance, however, has been the norm all season, with United's style of play proving impossible to describe. As chaotic as their style might be, leading to entertainment for those who are of a neutral persuasion, it always leads to the opposition taking full advantage.",
      "United, week-in, week-out, are churning out flat, uninspiring and dismal displays. It is approaching the point where they are, outside of the chaos, which generally leads to their opponent capitalising, boring to watch, such is the confusion about what they are actually trying to achieve.",
      "Going forward, United were lost against Andoni Iraola's well-drilled team, so much so that Ten Hag was having to instruct Amad what to do after his introduction at half-time. Rasmus Hojlund was anonymous through the middle and Marcus Rashford offered next to nothing on the left.",
      "In midfield, the same problems reared their ugly heads, with Casemiro's regression taking another step towards a point of no return. It is hard to recall one player's form plummeting so quickly in the way his has this season.",
      "Again, the gap between the defence and the midfield was big enough to park a collection of double-decker buses. In the full-back berths, neither Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka covered themselves in glory, with the former producing his worst showing for some time, regularly getting beaten down Bournemouth's left, particularly in the first half.",
      "United conceded 20 shots in total, meaning they have now faced 107 in four matches since the March international break. In that time, the Reds, staggeringly, have lost just once, and that happened to be on a night where they produced their best performance since the most recent hiatus.",
      "They were incredibly fortunate to take a point off both Brentford and Liverpool, despite leading both games heading into the closing stages, and should have been down and out against Bournemouth by half-time. As a result, they have now won just one of their last seven league matches and that was as a result of converting two penalties against an Everton team that has not won away from home since mid-December.",
      "United are now seventh in the table and in great danger of recording their lowest finish in the Premier League era. Try as Ten Hag might to avoid answering questions on the subject, there is no escaping it.",
      "United set the ambition of improving on last season's third-placed finish at the start of this term and Champions League qualification was a bare minimum expectation. With just a month of the season remaining, participation in the Europa Conference League is very much a realistic probability.",
      "Regardless of the injury situation, Ten Hag has had enough talent at his disposal to produce better results. The players, too, are capable of producing far better than what they have and are by no means blameless in this mess.",
      "This reporter has often backed Ten Hag and has called for him to be given a chance to prove his worth under the new regime, which is poised to include a competent football structure. However, it is becoming increasingly hard to defend him as a result of the on-field performances being produced.",
      "Winning the FA Cup could still save Ten Hag from the axe, but it already feels as though lifting the trophy aloft on May 25 will be a tall order because of the way United are currently playing. On the presumption they get past Coventry City and make it to the final, it is highly likely they will face Manchester City, who have already done a job on them twice this season.",
      "The FA Cup, nevertheless, does still represent United's best hope of salvaging something from this campaign, as qualifying for either the Europa League or the Europa Conference League will not count as success. It will be a huge step in reverse after winning a trophy and clinching a top four finish last season.",
      "United's next two league games are against the division's bottom two and both are at Old Trafford, meaning anything less than six points and two commanding performances will spell real trouble. Even if they win both of those, though, Champions League football will still almost certainly be a step too far.",
      "United do not deserve Champions League qualification and that is the bottom line. They have performed like a mediocre Europa Conference League side and they can have no complaints if that is what they end up 'achieving'.",

When this deal was agreed upon, this would not have been seen as much of an issue but the injury crisis at Old Trafford has severely affected Erik ten Hag's defensive options.",

      "Without Bruno Fernandes' input at the Vitality Stadium, Manchester United would have crashed to another embarrassing defeat on Saturday evening.",
      "The Premier League clash between United and Bournemouth ended in a 2-2 draw, with the visitors battling back from a half-time deficit to grab a share of the spoils. Fernandes, who had brought United level in the first half with an opportune volley, rescued them again after the break, calmly slotting home a penalty.",

The Portugal international racked up his seventh and eighth Premier League goals of the campaign and while the point is nowhere near enough for United in their quest for Champions League football, it at least keeps them clinging to some hope with six games remaining.",

The Dutchman, however, was full of praise for the player and how he rallied the players with his energy and passion, something that other players in the team could do with copying.",
      "\"Scoring twice, very creative, it's true he gives a lot of energy to the team,\" said Ten Hag. \"He is acting as a captain, bringing the energy and we are very pleased with this.",
      "\"We are all disappointed but he expresses that feeling. We have to win our games and we have dropped too many unnecessary points in the last few games.\"",
      "Fernandes was also hailed by Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp, who offered a strong defence of the player's exchanges with his teammates. The former England midfielder suggested that the culture at United needs changing to avoid Fernandes being driven 'insane' by the efforts of those around him.",
      "And Redknapp believes the lack of people caring in the team has become a culture that Ten Hag - or a potential replacement as manager this summer - has to change by building a team around their captain.",
      "\"He gets a lot of stick Bruno, a lot of stick. Some of it I get. I also think it is unfair. When I watch him play I see a player that genuinely cares. There’s a frustration, and yes sometimes there is pettiness sometimes, he’s calling out his players,\" Redknapp told Sky Sports.",
      "\"But if I was coming into the club or if it’s the manager Erik ten Hag if he keeps his job – he’s the sort of player you’re looking build the team around. He’s the player. He makes things happen.",
      "\"But what the frustration comes from is that I don’t think people care as much as he does. I see that as an epidemic at the club where people don’t really do enough – do they really care? Do they go flying into tackles?",
      "\"He, on the other hand does, and I think he sometimes gets himself into situations that he probably shouldn’t. But I tell you what he cares about his club, his team, he’s pulled his team back into that game today.",
      "\"I just see a player that you could build the team around and I don’t see many other players that shares the same appetite that he does. Yeah I get the culture. I think if you’ve got the right players around him, I get his frustration – it must drive him insane.\"",

      "Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.",
      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",

Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",

      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",

Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Manchester United are set to miss out on qualification for the Champions League next season and the failure will have knock-on implications",
      "Manchester United are almost certainly set to miss out on a place in the Champions League next season.",
      "Dropped points in the last two matches against Liverpool and AFC Bournemouth have pushed the Champions League spots out of realistic reach for Erik ten Hag's men. With six matches remaining, the Reds are 13 points behind the guaranteed qualification position of fourth and 10 points behind the potential Champions League place of fifth.",
      "United must now concentrate on qualifying for Europe altogether but the knock-on effects of missing out on the elite European competition are only just beginning. MEN Sport takes a look at what this all means for United below.",
      "Finishing between 4th and 7th in the Premier League sees little difference in terms of prize money. If United were to have snatched that guaranteed Champions League spot, they would have received based on last season's figures - £37.4m.",
      "However, finishing 6th would still bag £33m and 7th receives £30.8m. But the real financial blow comes in the difference between reaching the Champions League and not.",
      "This season, United received a cool £13.37m automatically for just reaching the group stages. This is significantly more than the £3.17m they would have received for reaching the group stages of the Europa League and £2.5m for getting to the Europa Conference League group stages.",
      "A £14m hit does not take into account winning matches in the Champions League either. A group stage victory earns you £2.39m compared to just £550K in the Europa League and £427K in the Europa Conference League.",
      "With the top five looking out of reach, finishing sixth should be United's aim now. What this will grant the Reds depends on how many Champions League spots England has at the end of the season based on their coefficient ranking.",
      "If the Premier League has the traditional four spots, sixth will guarantee the Europa League if the FA Cup winners have already secured European football through their league position. If they have not, this will become a Europa Conference League playoff spot.",
      "Should the Premier League have five Champions League spots, sixth is guaranteed Europa League football no matter what. If United finish seventh in this scenario they could also gain Europa League football so long as the FA Cup winners have already qualified for Europe through their league position.",
      "8th could be enough for the Europa Conference League playoffs so long as 7th does not become the Europa Conference League spot or the Carabao Cup winners do not qualify for Europe through their league position. This latter scenario is unlikely considering Liverpool won the Carabao Cup and are destined to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "To suggest the Dutchman's position at United is precarious would be an understatement. MEN Sport understands Sir Jim Ratcliffe was willing to be patient if United won the FA Cup and qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Champions League qualification is all but gone and winning the FA Cup is by no means a given even if they are favourites to reach the final. It is likely Ten Hag will be under excruciating pressure no matter what happens between now and May.",
      "Of course, they will have to make a call on whether to stick or twist with their manager but the implications of no Champions League football run deeper. With an increased Champions League next season, more clubs will be seen as good options for players because they are in the competition.",
      "Whereas INEOS will have to try and sell a new vision to recruits in the summer transfer window. While some could be excited by the project, it will be a tricky sell without the Champions League.",

      "Erik ten Hag is still reluctant to approach the away end when it might have marked the highlight of his afternoon at Bournemouth.",
      "There was not a whiff of mutiny from the 1,304 supporters in the east stand. They chanted \"United, United, United\", applauded the players and serenaded Bruno Fernandes. Casemiro gifted his shirt to a young fan, having gifted space to Bournemouth's midfielders.",
      "United's fans also proclaimed themselves as members of \"Ten Hag's army\" and going to Wem-ber-ley on Sunday. Hopefully, they will be there again on May 25 for the FA Cup final.",
      "Ten Hag will not need reminding that the last time United lifted the FA Cup, their Dutch manager was sacked 50 hours later. What he may not be aware of is that Louis van Gaal was booed when he received the FA Cup from David de Gea.",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Garnacho dealt with by Ten Hag over liking tweets",
      "EXCLUSIVE: Some United players delaying decisions on futures amid Ten Hag doubts",
      "The United squad were still stood in front of the Wembley royal box when it was Van Gaal's turn. The boos were not widespread but they were audible when he appeared on the big screen.",
      "Van Gaal was in denial and delusional. His wife, Truus, knew he would be sacked before he did. \"I knew Louis would be fired by Manchester United. I felt it,\" Truus says in the documentary Van Gaal. \"We had a small boardroom there and it was always fun with the old Manchester legends, Ferguson, Bobby Charlton. We had a table there with good food and drinks.",
      "\"Suddenly, they stopped greeting us, just waved from afar. Something was wrong. It was female intuition. Then when the man (Ed Woodward) denies it, Louis accepts it. I said, 'Louis, you're going to be fired. Get wise to it.' And I slammed the door of the apartment shut.\"",
      "Van Gaal admonished his wife in the aftermath of the Cup final for informing him of the BBC's report detailing his imminent sacking. This correspondent wrote three months earlier that Jose Mourinho had a gentleman's agreement to take over and several other credible stories charted Van Gaal's probable dismissal.",
      "Even after a high-profile associate of Ed Woodward leaked the story to the BBC, Van Gaal still entered the Wembley press conference room with the FA Cup. \"I show you the Cup and I don't discuss it with my friends of the media, who have already sacked me for six months,\" Van Gaal bragged.",
      "Time is a great healer. When Van Gaal was on punditry duty at United's 0-0 draw with Liverpool at Anfield in October 2017, the Dutch broadcasters were positioned in front of the away section in the Anfield Road End. Van Gaal was warmly greeted. During the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, he buried the hatchet with a Manchester-based reporter he insulted.",
      "Wayne Rooney penned a foreword in Van Gaal's book and was the United representative on his documentary. Rooney speaks glowingly about Van Gaal, \"tactically the best\" manager he worked with. He was also a manager he wanted to have replaced at the end of the 2015-16 season. Rooney's preference was Ryan Giggs.",
      "Van Gaal told Michael Carrick he would be released 11 days before the FA Cup final. De Gea intended to seek a transfer if Van Gaal stayed on. Even with the David Moyes precedent of failing to qualify for the Champions League sealing the United manager's fate, Van Gaal's head stayed in the sand.",
      "Renato Sanches's sudden transfer from Benfica to Bayern Munich was spun as Van Gaal did not want him. That was a smokescreen as United refused to publicly undermine Van Gaal amid Mourinho's inevitable arrival. Mourinho later admitted his \"late\" appointment scuppered a move for Sanches.",
      "Van Gaal was first booed when he approached the Stretford End after the listless 1-0 defeat to Southampton in January 2016. Moyes endured the ignominy of the 'Wrong one - Moyes out' banner flying overhead and, in front of the Elton John Stand, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was not still standing when he approached the away dayers at Watford. He was booed.",
      "Ten Hag has not been subjected to such treatment. When he conducted his pre-match chat with MUTV at Stamford Bridge, he was warmly applauded. Connecting with those who trek down the M6 to Selhurst Park and the Amex Stadium would do his image no harm. Neither would throwing expendable players under the bus (Anthony Martial).",
      "Yet there have been eerie parallels between Van Gaal and Ten Hag for most of the season. Ten Hag's press conference walk-out on Saturday was not as memorable as Van Gaal's wine-and-mince-pie valediction but he ignored an awkward question that raised United's comparable form with the Moyes season.",
      "Failure to qualify for the Champions League could precede another FA Cup final appearance, though the odds of United lifting it for a 13th time are not as auspicious as their 1990 rematch with Crystal Palace eight years ago. Coventry are capable of unsettling them and if United have to schedule fittings for new Paul Smith suits on May 25, City have had their number in both derbies this season. Chelsea have beaten four of the top seven and are unbeaten against City and Arsenal this season.",
      "Whatever United's result(s) at Wembley, Ten Hag is duty-bound to acknowledge their travelling supporters. It may be the last time he sees them.",

They had the bit between their teeth and were showing signs of encouragement.",

Fifth spot, which is currently occupied by Spurs, could still be enough to secure Champions League qualification for next season, but Erik ten Hag's troops are 10 points behind the Londoners.",

Sixth place will secure a Europa League group stage spot if the FA Cup winners have already qualified for Europe through their league position. If they have not, sixth becomes the Europa Conference League play-off spot.",

Both United and Chelsea are highly unlikely to finish inside the top four, meaning Europa League qualification is the best form of European football they can both secure for next term.",
      "Without diving too deep into all of the European permutations and the confusion that can generate, United know, if their league form continues to stumble, the FA Cup offers an alternative route into Europe for next season. Facing Coventry City in their respective semi-final this weekend, United are heavy favourites to reach the final, where they will either face Manchester City or Chelsea.",

      "It became a trend not to use old-school centre forwards, but strikers have enjoyed a renaissance over the last few years and they're suddenly very much in fashion again.",
      "Muniz is a throwback striker. He stands at 6ft 1in, looks as strong as an ox and his presence in the opposition penalty area is enough to unnerve defenders.",
      "Despite not getting on the scoresheet, he was superb at Old Trafford and it's interesting there have been reports suggesting he 'dreams' of playing for United in the future.",

      "Hojlund has vast potential and he enjoyed a brilliant start to 2024, scoring six league goals, but another forward is needed this summer, especially with Marcus Rashford's goals having dried up and Anthony Martial finally set for a departure upon the expiry of his contract.",
      "Muniz could be the perfect signing for United. He's got two years left on his contract with Fulham and perhaps a bid in the region of £40million would be enough to land him.",
      "Fulham would be reluctant to part ways with Muniz, with Aleksandar Mitrovic only leaving last summer, but the player's head could be turned by an approach from United.",
      "Muniz came through Flamengo's academy in his homeland, Fulham signed him for €8m (£6.8m) in the summer of 2021 and he spent last season on loan.",
      "He was unavailable for the first part of this campaign with a knee injury, but he's made up for lost time in the spring and looks capable of being second choice for United.",
      "Hojlund has almost single-handedly shouldered the burden of scoring United's goals and that pressure has come too soon on young shoulders. Muniz would ease the load on Hojlund and could contribute from the bench and feature in the different cup competitions.",
      "There should be a chance his dream of playing for United becomes a reality.",

      "Erik ten Hag's position as Man United manager is becoming more and more uncertain, meaning Sir Jim Ratcliffe may be forced into taking decisive action.",
      "Following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth, Manchester United have a maximum of eight games left this season.",
      "For Erik ten Hag, they could well amount to his final eight games as United manager. The weekend's stalemate at the Vitality Stadium was another mark against his chances of keeping his job beyond the end of this season.",
      "As a result of Aston Villa's 2-0 win at Arsenal on Sunday, United are now 13 points shy of the top four with just 18 points to play for. The Champions League theme tune will almost certainly not be played by the Old Trafford compere next season.",
      "With United's Premier League campaign now in danger of petering out, there is also a danger the Europa League theme tune will not be played, either. The Reds have won just one of their last seven Premier League games and are winless in four.",
      "Though Ten Hag still has a chance of winning a second trophy in as many seasons at Old Trafford, it is becoming increasingly hard to argue against Sir Jim Ratcliffe not making a change in the dugout. Ratcliffe, who secured minority ownership in February, has wasted no time in making sweeping changes in the boardroom, meaning it would be no surprise to see him make a change in the dugout.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News at the end of February, Ineos have already analysed potential replacements for Ten Hag. Based on what has happened since the March international break, you cannot blame them.",
      "Since the pause, United have played four, lost one and drawn three. If they don't get their first post-international break win on the board against Coventry City at Wembley, it will be nigh-on impossible for even the most staunch Ten Hag supporter to continue backing him.",
      "While results, of course, are the bread and butter for any manager, it is United's performances throughout the season that have asked the most questions of Ten Hag. It is no secret that an unprecedented injury crisis has played its part in the club's regression, but it was clear from the very start of the season that something was not right.",
      "Everyone is aware of the bombardment United's goal is constantly under, with Bournemouth's tally of 20 shots meaning they have now faced 107 in their last four matches. Ten Hag has played that concern down while Diogo Dalot contradicted him when asked about the problem.",
      "Based on United's uninspiring style of play and their worsening performance levels, it is beginning to feel inevitable that Ratcliffe will decide to make a change. But if Ratcliffe does decide to pull the trigger, who does he turn to? It is a question nobody has an immediate answer to. There is not an obvious, standout candidate.",
      "Gareth Southgate has been heavily linked with the post but is not worthy of commanding such a high-profile position, despite his good work with England. Roberto De Zerbi is yet to prove he is qualified enough for the role.",
      "In the past, United, when deciding or needing to make a change, have had their ducks in a row, instantly being able to appoint a big name, such as Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal. Ten Hag was also the overriding favourite to succeed Ralf Rangnick in 2022, with it always felt he was far more likely to land the job than Mauricio Pochettino, who was also in the frame for quite some time.",
      "Back in 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson recommended that David Moyes should replace him following his retirement. It marked another instance where the Glazers had a relatively simple decision to make.",
      "For Ratcliffe, who has secured control of football operations, selecting a potential replacement for Ten Hag will not be so simple. Despite Ineos' fondness of Southgate, they should sense that appointing him would not wash with the fans.",
      "Looking at the managerial landscape as it is now, Thomas Tuchel, who will leave Bayern Munich at the end of this season, may be the only coach available who commands the tag of being an 'elite-level coach', and even his stock has fallen somewhat this season.",
      "Ratcliffe may be left with no choice but to make a change in the coming weeks, but selecting a replacement will be no straightforward task. A big decision, one way or another, needs to be made.",

      "\"What we missed in our squad was behind Casemiro, another one, typical holding midfielder. So with him, we have one,\" Ten Hag said about Amrabat after his loan move.",
      "\"But also Amrabat can play alongside Casemiro because he is also capable of playing in a higher position on the pitch, also he can play as a wing-back or full-back.\"",
      "Ten Hag forgot to mention the fifth role that Amrabat could play: the bench warmer and an extra body in training at Carrington to prepare for matches.",
      "Unfortunately for Amrabat, he's made just one start - in the FA Cup - across all competitions in 2024 and he's become an irrelevance in the second half of the season.",
      "That start came in the 1-0 win over Nottingham Forest in the fifth round of England's oldest cup competition and his last start before that came against Liverpool in December.",
      "Amrabat has played just over 1,100 minutes in a United shirt, which means he's averaged 157 minutes each month since his arrival and that emphasises his peripheral status.",
      "The 27-year-old travelled to the Africa Cup of Nations with Morocco in January and nobody suggested his absence would be a blow because he's hardly played for United.",
      "There was a small section of the fanbase on social media that said Amrabat would be the club's saviour this season, one of the final pieces to the midfield jigsaw.",
      "The analytics community pointed to his promising statistics with Fiorentina in Serie A, while others based their opinions on watching Amrabat at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
      "There is a clip of Amrabat powerfully sprinting back and tackling Kylian Mbappe that is repeatedly shared, but having a highlight reel on YouTube does not correlate with being a quality player.",
      "Amrabat has looked below the standard required when he's played and it's a damning indictment of how he's become viewed by Ten Hag that he's not starting over Casemiro.",
      "Casemiro has been a passenger for months in the midfield, his passing has been wayward and his positioning questionable, so the drop-off in his performances has been stark.",
      "United paid €10million (around £8.5m) to sign Amrabat on loan from Fiorentina and he was signed to deputise for Casemiro, yet he's failed to get the nod over the declining Brazilian.",
      "Amrabat seems like a good character to have in the dressing room and he's been likeable in interviews, but he's judged on the pitch and he's struggled to get onto it.",
      "The €10m loan fee must be considered a waste and it's probably at least 1000/1 odds that United will trigger their option to sign him on a permanent deal this summer for €25m.",
      "It's understood there were doubts about signing Amrabat among some recruitment staff and with the benefit of hindsight, such concerns about the transfer had merit.",
      "Ten Hag, who previously worked with Amrabat at Utrecht, pushed to sign him regardless but has abandoned him with the business end of the season having arrived.",
      "Amrabat can be added to the catalogue of underwhelming signings at United.",

      "Ondrej Mastny has a spring in his step.",
      "The young goalkeeper is back in his homeland having left Manchester United in the summer. While he loved and appreciated his time and chances at Old Trafford, he’s happier back in the Czech Republic with regular football the main reason why.",
      "\"I was a bit down when I was in England and not playing,\" the 22-year-old admitted, speaking to the Manchester Evening News. \"But I have got a second wind since I came home.\"",
      "Mastny moved to Manchester at 16. He didn’t speak English and was far from family and friends. Naturally a quiet teenager, he wanted to make his mark with his performances.",
      "Injury robbed him of the chance in his first season, the Covid pandemic interrupted his promising second. Plenty would have buckled but Mastny stood tall and fought on.",
      "He became a regular for the Under 18 and Under 21 teams, played in the UEFA Youth League, FA Youth Cup and Football League Trophy. Training sessions with the first team followed, where David de Gea was an invaluable help with pointers, advice and encouragement.",
      "\"It is always nice to have someone like him to support and encourage you,\" said Mastny. \"They (the first team goalkeepers) tried to help me and I tried to learn.\"",
      "The learning started early, as much away from football as on the pitch.",
      "\"It was hard because it is a new country, new team, new environment and new people,\" he said. \"I am not the type of person who the room is for them. I am not the guy who just speaks to everyone, especially when I was 16 and didn't speak the language.",
      "\"I was hoping to play games and show what I can do on the pitch, which unfortunately I couldn't. I was sad after that season, I didn't achieve what I wanted to achieve. The next season was better, I played almost everything but then Covid came.\"",
      "Mastny was away from home, family and friends during the pandemic, living with a host family who he is still in touch with today and plans to visit in the coming months.",
      "It was a difficult time for all, let alone a teenager trying to make his mark in football in a foreign country. Mastny is proud of his resilience to overcome some pretty hefty obstacles.",
      "\"I think I did well to come through the injuries and setbacks and the second season was almost a reward for it,\" he said. \"Playing Youth Cup, Youth League, PL 2 and all those things. Being with the first team It is a great experience I would never forget.\"",
      "Ultimately, with playing time drying up, Mastny opted to return to Vysočina Jihlava, the club he left for United six years ago. He could have remained at Old Trafford, perhaps sought a loan and waited to see if an opportunity opened up. But Mastny was ready for the next chapter.",
      "\"It definitely wasn't easy (to leave),\" he added. \"I was thinking about it a lot but I was tired of not playing. I was away from family and friends and all I wanted to do was play. I wasn't playing much and that was my main focus.",
      "\"So far I am playing and doing well and doing what I waned to do so I'm satisified with what is going on.\"",
      "Mastny, now back living with his parents, has had the benefit of six years at United, with world-class coaching and access to world-class players. It's helped his development and he hopes it will take him from the second tier of Czech football back into a major European league.",
      "\"I have a drive in me,\" he said. \"I would love to get into the first division with this team because I came here at 13 .",
      "\"I feel more confident, 100 per cent. I have been at United so you have that thing where you are good at playing football! I have been my own since I was 16 in a different country, it made me stronger. I went through injuries and some hard times. I believe in myself.",
      "\"That (playing abroad) is one of the goals. The first is to play because if you don't play then no one can see you. The next goal is the first division here and if I am good enough then I am open to going abroad again and trying to play at the highest level.\"",

      "The pressure was on Man Utd to secure a positive result versus Bournemouth and the points were shared on the south coast.",
      "Willy Kambwala's marking of Dominic Solanke always had the potential to be a mismatch.",
      "The Bournemouth forward has been in excellent form this season and impressed when scoring at Old Trafford in December, so Kambwala was expected to be challenged. Kambwala was superb against Liverpool last weekend and performed admirably against a pacy attack loaded with talent, but the physically imposing Solanke represented a different type of striker to deal with and it didn't take long for him to make his mark on Saturday evening.",
      "Bournemouth wasted no time in getting Solanke involved and Manchester United received early warning signs of what was to come from the 26-year-old. Solanke won an early duel with Kambwala and headed just over the bar, before finding the back of the net just a few moments later as the defender slipped to the turf.",
      "There was an element of rotten luck for Kambwala, who slipped to the ground on the watered pitch, but he did seem to panic as Solanke hurled his way toward the ball. Harry Maguire encouraged Kambwala as the players trudged back for the restart and he regained his composure. However, you'd struggle to find a fan who doesn't think that United need to sign a quality centre-back, someone who can start every week, in the summer.",
      "Kambwala only made his United debut in December. His displays have been laudable when called upon and he's certainly staked a claim to have a squad role next season. Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans, who both missed the game through injury, are out of contract at the end of the season and both look likely to depart.",
      "Victor Lindelof was another absentee through injury and he's always been a squad player at best, so it's finally time to move him on, more than seven years since he signed. Lisandro Martinez was one of United's best players last season, but he's been plagued by different injury problems and it's unclear whether such issues will persist.",
      "Although Martinez is the first name on the team sheet when he's fit, he's made just seven starts in the league this season and perhaps can't be relied upon to be available. Doubts remain over Maguire's long-term future after he came close to leaving last summer, with West Ham submitting a bid for the former club captain.",
      "Inevitably, there will be defensive upheaval in the summer transfer window and Sir Jim Ratcliffe's new hierarchy must sign a centre-back who is always available. On the evidence of this season, Maguire should be kept, Kambwala can contribute and Martinez will be at the top of the pecking order, based on his first year.",
      "Another centre-half needs to arrive to partner Martinez at the heart of the backline and Maguire and Kambwala - the starting pair at Bournemouth - could deputise.",
      "It's obvious United need a centre-half but strengthening the attack and midfield is also required, which means a new core of the team could be brought in. Ralf Rangnick famously said United needed 'open heart surgery' when he was interim manager and not much has changed since the German left his position in 2022.",

      "There was excitement among Man Utd fans when Sir Alex Ferguson signed forward David Bellion in the summer of 2003.",
      "A group of former Premier League players who aren't currently contracted to a club have a WhatsApp group to support each other.",
      "When the phone stops ringing and a professional career comes to an end, some players go into coaching, some work in radio or TV, while others fall out of the game completely. Research has shown that 33 per cent of footballers are divorced within a year of retirement and studies have revealed elite sports people are likely to suffer from a loss of identity.",
      "The footballing wilderness can be difficult to manoeuvre but, thankfully, not for David Bellion - he's found purpose since hanging up his boots and is thriving in his new career. Bellion signed for United from Sunderland in the summer of 2003 and club insiders privately believed Sir Alex Ferguson could transform him into a talent like Thierry Henry.",
      "Ferguson was blown away when he watched Bellion at an Under-20 youth tournament in Jersey. He later jumped at the chance to sign him on a free transfer.",
      "\"This is a dream come true,\" Bellion said at his unveiling. \"I am ambitious and when you want to achieve the best things then you can't ask for more than joining one of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "\"I have a long way to go to make it at United. I have a lot to learn and I will give everything to be a success. It is the biggest challenge of my life but I don't see it as a pressure. It is an exciting prospect to be 20, to be a professional footballer with one of the best in the world and be surrounded by the best players in the world.\"",
      "A delighted Ferguson said: \"It's been a long process to complete this deal. We didn't know whether David would go abroad or come to us. We are delighted he has chosen United.\"",
      "David Beckham had joined Real Madrid and Bellion was the first signing of the post-Becks era, although it was Ryan Giggs who the Frenchman was looking to emulate.",
      "\"Ryan Giggs was a particular favourite of mine. I used to watch him closely because I loved the way he took on players at speed,\" Bellion later said in 2004.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Ryan will be someone I can learn a lot from. However, with the world-class quality at Old Trafford I can learn from everyone. I think the more I add to my game from each player the more versatile I will be and the better it will be for me.",
      "\"Eric Cantona, of course, was another favourite. Everyone in France loved Eric because he was a character. He was a strong personality and above all else a winner and that was a great example for kids.\"",
      "Bellion was competing with Ruud van Nistelrooy, Diego Forlan and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to start at United and it was never going to be easy for him to break into the side. He was an unused substitute for a victory over Arsenal in the Charity Shield and only played seven minutes in the opening nine Premier League matches of his first season.",
      "Unfortunately, he failed to convince he was the standard of forward required and Wayne Rooney, Alan Smith and Giuseppe Rossi were signed in the summer of 2004. He quickly slipped down the pecking order and was given just seven starts in his second campaign, which left him considering his future.",
      "Although Bellion spent the first half of the 2005/2006 season with West Ham, that didn't go as planned and he admitted it was difficult to get along with manager Alan Pardew.",
      "\"I asked to join West Ham on loan,\" said Bellion in 2006. \"But human relations aren't easy with Alan Pardew - I don't want to talk about it.\"",
      "Bellion's loan in London was cut short and he joined Nice for the remainder of the season, a return home and to familiar surroundings. He played football with a smile on his face again and caught the eye of Bordeaux, who brought the curtain down on his time in Manchester when signing him permanently in 2007.",
      "\"Leaving England was a hard choice to make, but I think there is huge potential in Nice and I don't regret a thing,\" he said. \"I love playing football too much to stay on the bench.\"",
      "Bellion spent seven years with Bordeaux, as he continued to struggle for playing time, and his final move saw him spend a few seasons with Parisian side Red Star. He called time on his playing career in 2016 but remained with the club in a role as their creative director.",
      "“When I had to give up because it was too much for me, then I became a creative director,\" he said. \"All the images I saw, all the magazines I read, all the movies I watched, all the fashion shows I went to, brought me a lot of ideas that I could put into football and my creative direction.",
      "“There are some players that have got the Golden Ball, I guess, or they are world champion, but they’re not happy the day after that. They’re happy just because they made it, but what’s next?”",
      "It turns out fashion was next for Bellion. “When I got out of training, I went to stores just to look at the clothes. Sometimes I didn’t buy anything,” he recently told GQ magazine.",
      "“I am a great romantic and I embrace it perfectly in my way of seeing things. I have a bit of a childish side. I don’t have a very developed competitive spirit, more of an obsession with beauty.",
      "“[It gave] as much pleasure as signing for Manchester United,” he added when asked about a collaboration with rapper Disiz for the cover of GQ Men of the Year.",
      "In a separate interview with Closed, he said: \"As a footballer, despite the incredible opportunity to play the game I love, I always felt constrained by the lack of control of my schedule.",
      "\"I longed for more freedom. As a naturally curious person with interests from lifestyle to culture, music and fashion, I saw myself in roles that involved creative direction and brand management.",
      "\"Alongside running my own agency, I've opened a barber shop, co-founded magazines, and work as a stylist, all fueled by my passion.\"",
      "He continued: \"I always wanted to play for Manchester United and I did. But the best feeling of my professional career so far was the moment I was able to buy my mother a new home and tell her she could quit her job because I was making enough money from kicking a football.",
      "\"I started to have responsibilities when I was in England. I went there when I was 18, so I was still a child in my mind. I will always remember the warmth and love of the people in the north.",
      "\"I also met my wife in Manchester. And I think the weather suited me in a strange way because I find the rain and the grey weather very romantic.",
      "\"So I was very happy to be in a country where the weather might not be so great, which is fine for me, but the people always have a smile.\"",
      "Bellion also has a smile on his own face - he's found a second love after football."

      "The main talking points and highlights as Man Utd drew 2-2 against Bournemouth in the Premier League.",
      "Manchester United drew 2-2 against Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday evening.",
      "Bournemouth took the lead through Dominic Solanke just 15 minutes into the game and could have extended their lead after that, but Bruno Fernandes hit back on the half-hour.",
      "Fernandes volleyed home after some excellent work from Alejandro Garnacho down the wing. But Bournemouth's lead was restored just moments later.",
      "The points were eventually shared thanks to Fernandes' penalty in the second half. Here are the main talking points from the match.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "When United won against Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-final, there was a moment in the first half when Dominik Szoboszlai broke forward in acres of space.",
      "A still image quickly went viral on social media and it only wasn't a prominent post-match talking point because Liverpool were defeated in dramatic circumstances. The space between the defensive line and the midfield has been a problem all season and the pockets which the opposition exploit are big enough for a bus to be parked.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Bournemouth took advantage of that repeat failing. It felt like Kobbie Mainoo was the only person in midfield at times, with Fernandes so high and Casemiro a passenger.",
      "The midfield is completely dysfunctional and when Bournemouth scored their second, Fernandes and Mainoo held an inquest as they walked back for the restart.",
      "It was an amicable, natural discussion between two players after conceding but it did feel symbolic of the issues. Both were searching for answers and it's ultimately Ten Hag's responsibility to ensure the team's structure isn't so easily penetrated.",
      "The problem is it's groundhog day when analysing United.",
      "Casemiro has become a passenger",
      "Casemiro enjoyed an exceptional first season in Manchester but his second at the club has been disastrous and he's become the player most fans feared United were signing.",
      "When he returned from a hamstring injury in January, his challenge for the remainder of the campaign was to prove he could still contribute but he's continued to regress. He's now starting by default and surely, would have been dropped if there was a suitable alternative.",
      "The irony is United paid a £10million loan fee to sign Sofyan Amrabat and he's been sporadically used, despite a stark drop off in Casemiro's performances. It's a damning indictment of Amrabat that he can still not get a sniff when Casemiro is playing so poorly. Mason Mount will also feel aggrieved.",
      "Casemiro couldn't watch when Fernandes took the penalty and turned his back. He recently said United give him sleepless nights - there will be a few more of those.",
      "European challenge",
      "Newcastle's win over Tottenham before the game increased the pressure on United. Defeats for English sides in European competition earlier in the week mean a fifth-placed Premier League finish likely won't be good enough for a Champions League slot.",
      "United needed to win against Bournemouth and could only muster a draw. Ten Hag has reiterated United will fight until the end of the season for Champions League qualification, but time is running out and just six league games remain. Aston Villa, who sit in fourth, are 10 points ahead and that gap looks increasingly difficult to close.",
      "Antony's momentum disrupted",
      "Antony was missing at Bournemouth due to an injury. Most fans would have preferred him to start over Rashford given his impressive performance against Chelsea and bright cameo against Liverpool last weekend, so it was a shame to see his momentum disrupted when it felt like he could finally turn a corner.",
      "The Brazilian has looked a fraction of an £86million player and while that price tag will never be vindicated, he's shown signs of life in recent weeks. Whether he can turn his time in Manchester around remains to be seen.",
      "He's contributed 10 goals and five assists in 77 appearances and that's not good enough. If United progress to the FA Cup final, there are eight games left in all competitions and time is running out for Antony to end the campaign on a positive note.",
      "The kids are alright",
      "There was no room in the matchday squad for Jack Kingdon, who trained with the first-team on Friday, but promising forward Ethan Wheatley was given the opportunity to travel.",
      "Wheatley has eight goals and two assists in just seven league appearances for the Under-18s this season and notched a hat-trick against rivals Liverpool last weekend.",
      "Harry Amass was included in the senior matchday squad at Old Trafford last Sunday and Habeeb Ogunneye has now made four squads in the Premier League. Although those youngsters are unlikely to feature from the bench when involved, the experience of being around the first-team environment is invaluable.",
      "The milestone of the 250th player from the academy to make their senior debut will be reached imminently and Ten Hag's promotion of youth deserves praise. However, Louis van Gaal gave 14 debuts to players from the academy and that still wasn't enough to keep his job.",

      "Manchester United are tipped to recruit in midfield during the summer transfer window with Casemiro earmarked for the exit door at Old Trafford",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has warned Manchester United and other interested clubs to avoid signing Everton midfielder Amadou Onana in the summer transfer window.",
      "United were first linked with a move for Onana at the beginning of the campaign as they looked to add options to their midfield. The Manchester Evening News understands United are continuing to monitor Onana, along with Everton teammate Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Erik ten Hag could be heading back into the race to sign a defensive midfielder this coming summer after Casemiro's form dipped dramatically this season. Beyond Casemiro, the Reds have been light in the defensive midfield area of the pitch this season and could reinforce their midfield options when the summer transfer window opens, with the Brazilian having been tentatively linked with a potential move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "In January, as Everton's Financial Fair Play (FFP) woes deepened, Arsenal and Newcastle United were heavily linked with Onana's signature but again the move did not come through. Still, the Belgian did little to impress at Stamford Bridge on Monday night as he was hauled off at half-time during Everton's 6-0 defeat to Chelsea.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund had found his feet at Manchester United but he has struggled again since returning from injury and has been a peripheral figure in recent games.",
      "When Rasmus Hojlund scored both of Manchester United's goals in the 2-1 win at Luton Town in February his stock had never been higher. After a tough start to life at Old Trafford, breaking his Premier League duck had opened the floodgates and a double against the Hatters made it eight goals in as many games.",
      "But then came an injury and a month of inaction and as quickly as he went from cold to hot over Christmas, his temperature plummeted once more. It is now 405 minutes without a goal since his return and more concerningly there have been just three shots in that time.",
      "In his spell of looking like an unstoppable Premier League striker, between Boxing Day and February 18, Hojlund had 16 shots in eight games, but he's barely influenced recent fixtures and United's results have turned in accordance with their £72million striker starting to look goal shy once again.",
      "Hojlund played the full game in those successive draws against Liverpool and Bournemouth but didn't have a single shot and managed 60 touches across 180 minutes. Bruno Fernandes is picking up the goalscoring slack for now, but United need Hojlund to catch fire once more.",
      "Not only is it essential that the club's leading striker scores goals, but with Anthony Martial leaving Old Trafford this summer, a new striker is towards the top of the shopping list in the first window under the influence of Ineos. If Hojlund remains in a funk and continues to look like a striker capable of going through streaky spells of good and bad, then the dilemma of the profile of forward to sign becomes more of an issue.",
      "During that mid-winter spell, Hojlund had started to look like the right deal. He began to lead the line with the quality as well as the confidence of a United No.9, but it has to be a concern that he is struggling to maintain that kind of form. With potentially eight games of this season to go, United will want to see a return to that level.",
      "Goals from Hojlund will help in a battle with Newcastle - and potentially Chelsea - for sixth place and they could be vital if a spot in the FA Cup final is secured. But they would also allay any fears of needing another elite striker to help score the weight of goals expected next season.",
      "In a summer when United are set to miss out on Champions League football and continue to balance FFP issues, they could do without the requirement of buying a proven goalscorer. In spending £72million on Hojlund last summer, that is what they hoped to have got.",
      "United always accepted that the Dane was a work in progress and there have been times when the potential has looked ready to blossom. Now in spring time it needs to do just that. This season isn't without mitigation for him either, given how poorly the team has played at times.",
      "The 21-year-old looks to have what it takes to carry the pressure and the burden of being the main man at United. Erik ten Hag has lauded his bravery and character this season and during his run of goals, he revealed what Hojlund was like when things weren't going for him.",
      "\"I can tell you it’s not easy for a striker when you have high expectations from yourself, also the outside world has high expectations, to fulfil that when it’s not working,\" he said.",
      "\"That is the character every striker needs, he gets angry, he gets mad when he’s not scoring, but that’s why we selected him, he has the resilience and the calmness to perform under that stress.\"",
      "That stress will have started to return now, but Hojlund has already shown once that not only can he overcome it, but that one goal can lead to a hatful. Finishing the season in that style would be beneficial for several reasons.",

      "The duo have played starring roles in helping Leverkusen clinch the Bundesliga crown, making 50 appearances between them. Frimpong has excelled at right wing-back, scoring eight goals and registering seven assists, while Tapsoba has been solid at centre-back.",
      "Naturally, interest in both players has increased over the course of this season, meaning they may be forced to cash in come the summer. And according to Carro, they will almost certainly have to sell one of their star assets to generate funds for new additions.",
      "Speaking to Spanish newspaper Diario AS, Carro said: \"Every year we need to sell one big player to find budget for new signings, so probably we will sell one player. We're planning to sign two or three players with that amount of money.\"",
      "United held discussions with the representatives of Frimpong last year, identifying him as a target ahead of the 2023 summer transfer window. However, Aaron Wan-Bissaka's shock resurrection meant the Reds shelved plans to add another right-back to their ranks ahead of this campaign.",
      "Frimpong, who started out at Manchester City, is under contract at Leverkusen until 2028, as is Tapsoba. United are set to be in the market for both a new full-back and centre-back this forthcoming summer.",

      "Man United dropped more points in the Premier League and have dropped down to seventh after drawing with Brentford.",
      "Manchester United formed a huddle when they re-emerged for the second half. They are still a muddle.",
      "\"You're s**t and you know you are,\" the Bournemouth denizens informed them. There was no direct response and the defiant atmosphere in the away end suggested those from Manchester are well aware of that status.",
      "The United supporters are offering support that their team does not merit. They sang non-stop in the sunshine and at least avoided another defeat south of the M6. The players were greeted with a chorus of \"United, United, United\" by the away section at the contest's conclusion.",
      "Yet this was another nail in their league coffin. United did not succumb to a Premier League-era record 13th defeat of the season but that feels a matter of time with six matches remaining. They have won one of their past seven league games.",
      "Erik ten Hag, once an impassive observer in the technical area, is looking more frayed with every week. United continue to be mired in regression, devoid of an identity and structure.",
      "The only recognisable quality is their away dayers. Thousands will wake up hoarse on Sunday morning and a more mutinous following would have long since turned against the manager. Ten Hag will cling on for the remainder of the season but United are not changing. They conceded shortly after scoring again.",
      "Steve McClaren twice emerged in the technical area in added time with his hands on his head, bracing himself for the inevitable. Willy Kambwala was inches away from conceding a penalty that was downgraded to a free-kick by the Video Assistant Referee. Enes Unal's goalbound free-kick ricocheted behind in the 98th minute.",
      "The Premier League is almost an afterthought for the United matchgoers, who sang with gusto about next week's FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Newcastle leapfrogged United with their lunchtime thrashing of Tottenham. United are likelier to be in the Europa Conference League at this rate.",
      "This was the worst first half performance from a United side in, well, six days. Bournemouth unleashed 12 attempts at United's goal in the first 45 minutes and most were excellent openings. Andre Onana stood motionless as the ball passed his post more than once, Milos Kerkez hit the crossbar and was more wasteful on the rebound while Justin Kluivert volleyed straight at the United goalkeeper.",
      "Bournemouth's profligacy cost them what would have been a first domestic double against English football's most glamorous club. United have already conceded the most attempts at their goal in a season since records began. Ten Hag claims the fixation on the stat is \"ridiculous\". United are ridiculous.",
      "United's mixed messages were as clear as the south coast skyline and mutiny started to simmer on the pitch, rather than in the stands. Bruno Fernandes and Onana bickered in the seventh minute over whether to go long or short from goal kicks, with Onana keenly loyal to his principles.",
      "Ten Hag ordered Fernandes to show some restraint, Fernandes refused, so Ten Hag gave him a ticking off. The United captain ended the disagreement by wagging his finger.",
      "Fernandes scored both of United's goals, taking his tally for the season to a creditable 11. Casemiro, perched on the halfway line, could not watch after United were awarded a penalty for Adam Smith's reflex handball. From 12 yards, Fernandes was a safe bet on Grand National day and he was serenaded again at full-time.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho started his 30th successive United match and the workload has become so onerous he was hooked for Amad at the interval. Within ten minutes, Ten Hag was having to instruct Amad where to position himself.",
      "This was only Amad's fifth appearance of the campaign and every time he has emerged off the bench United have been losing or drawing. His use has been so sparing he is not always going to be tuned to the same frequency.",
      "The furthest Onana ventured from his goal was to the dugout for a motivational time-out. He nestled his hands on the shoulders of Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund and high-fived Harry Maguire. He did not make such flush contact with Kluivert's shot that breached his goal at the near post.",
      "Kambwala, on his third start, lost his first two duels with Dominic Solanke and was sufficiently spooked for their next tussle. The 19-year-old panicked, lost his footing and United were soon losing 1-0 to Bournemouth again through another Solanke opener.",
      "Maguire endeavoured to encourage Kambwala and there was not enough of that from his other teammates. The strapping Solanke was a more awkward opponent than Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz or Mohamed Salah. Kambwala is not the first callow United defender to get a going-over by a streetwise striker and a similar duel awaits with Coventry's Ellis Simms in the semi-final next week.",
      "Maguire had a conflab with physio Richard Merron and doctor Jim Moxon over an apparent issue. Unusually, there was no sign of head of sports medicine Gary O'Driscoll, absent from the dugout due to personal reasons.",
      "Antony's absence marked the 57th separate case of injury or illness to cause a United player to miss a game. Maguie soldiered on. Amad also required treatment during the wait for Fernandes's penalty.",
      "They are still a muddle.",

Especially if one of the players is struggling and we couldn't sub him as well as we are running out of the centre halves.",
      "\"We give all we can but I am also realistic. When the full squad was there, we still could have high belief but we will keep fighting also with the players who are available, you see high potential.",

      "Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho has made a U-turn on his decision to 'like' posts on social media criticising manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Following Saturday's 2-2 draw with Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium, Garnacho, who was substituted at half-time, 'liked' two posts that were published on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. The Argentine's interaction with the posts suggested he was in agreement with the publisher's criticism of the United boss.",
      "Both posts were made by well-known United fan and YouTuber Mark Goldbridge. In the first post 'liked' by Garnacho, the former questioned Ten Hag's decision to substitute him at the half-time interval.",
      "Goldbridge posted: \"Garnacho has been one of our best players this season. Poor first half but taking him off at half-time and holding him up as the problem is a joke. Many have done much worse week in week out and are still out there.\"",
      "The United Stand presenter then added a second post, saying: \"Ten Hag subtly blaming Garnacho in the post-match press conference... not a good look throwing a 19-year-old under the bus who has actually delivered for you this season. But then again he's clearly scared of upsetting the bigger earners.\"",
      "Garnacho's decision to 'like' both posts immediately went viral, attracting plenty of questions from United supporters. The youngster has since reversed his decision, choosing to 'unlike' them.",
      "Jadon Sancho, albeit in a different way, was critical of Ten Hag on social media back in September, following the Reds' 3-1 defeat to Arsenal on September 3. Sancho, who is currently on loan at Borussia Dortmund, accused the United manager of lying after he was left out of the matchday squad.",
      "Ten Hag revealed, following the defeat at the Emirates Stadium, that Sancho had been left out of the squad due to his performance levels in training. Sancho went on the attack, posting a statement on X saying: \"Please don't believe everything you read. I will not allow people saying things that is completely untrue, I have conducted myself in training very well this week. I believe there are other reasons for this matter which I won't go into, I've been a scapegoat for a long time which isn't fair!",

I respect all decisions that are made by the coaching staff, I play with fantastic players and grateful to do so which I know every week is a challenge. I will continue to fight for this badge no matter what!\"",

      "\"We lost some balls in areas we shouldn't lose them,\" he said. \"If you see the first goal, the set-up was good but in that area you should never lose the ball but it's still not a goal. On the right side defending we had some problems in the first half. At half-time, we repaired it.",
      "\"In the second half, Harry was better, we repaired it on the right side and we took more control of the game and if we would have been more calm and composed, we could have had a win.",
      "\"First half, they were better. They created chances but the good thing is we returned twice from losing positions. So this team, the spirit is good, the resilience is good, they showed some character.",
      "\"I think we had to repair over the right side. We didn't play well, the spaces were there. In possession, we had to bring a sub there.",
      "\"Garnacho was during the week not training. Only yesterday. We thought to bring some energy and bring some more quality, quality in the sense of cooperation and togetherness on that right-hand side.\"",
      "Following Ten Hag's admission of United's problem down the right-hand side, Garnacho has responded on social media by liking two tweets about his substitution.",
      "Well-known United supporter Mark Goldbridge slammed Ten Hag's decision to replace Garnacho on X, formerly Twitter. Garnacho liked the two tweets from Goldbridge.",
      "The first tweet read: \"Garnacho has been one of our best players this season. Poor first half but taking him off at half-time and holding him up as the problem is a joke. Many have done much worse week in week out and are still out there.\"",
      "Two hours later, Goldbridge added: \"Ten Hag subtly blaming Garnacho in the post-match press conference... not a good look throwing a 19-year-old under the bus who has actually delivered for you this season. But then again he's clearly scared of upsetting the bigger earners.\"",

      "Shea Lacey is one the most exciting talents in Man Utd's academy and he's signed his first professional contract with the club.",
      "Manchester United youngster Shea Lacey has signed his first professional contract.",
      "Last month, the Manchester Evening News confirmed Lacey would sign his professional deal once he celebrated his 17th birthday and he's now officially put pen to paper.",
      "Only the most highly-regarded prospects in the academy are given professional terms when they turn 17 - the age when you can sign a pro deal - and Lacey has long been considered one of the leading lights in his age group, which explains why he's been tied down at the first opportunity.",
      "There are high hopes at United for Lacey and he recently took part in first-team training at Carrington following his return from an injury that saw him sidelined for six months.",
      "It's understood that injury was the first of Lacey's blossoming career and his return to fitness should allow him to contribute to the Under-18s at a crucial stage of the season.",
      "After a brilliant campaign, the U18s are set to win their league and have the opportunity to win a trophy when they take on Manchester City on April 23 at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Lacey is expected to play a prominent role as the U18s look to seal the league title in the coming weeks and he's set to represent the Under-21s regularly in 2024/25.",
      "In the last few years, footage of Lacey playing for United's academy has gone viral on social media and such clips have amassed thousands of views.",
      "Lacey was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",
      "He has predominately played on the right wing, but coaches in the academy like to challenge youngsters in different positions across the attack and Lacey is versatile.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the City star, his long-term future could lie in playing an attacking midfield role.",
      "Lacey is the latest academy talent to sign his first professional deal at United, following confirmation that Harry Amass and Jack and Tyler Fletcher had been given contracts.",

      "It was confirmed on Thursday night that Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans would be unavailable for this weekend's clash at the Vitality Stadium due to muscle injuries. Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof are sidelined and Harry Maguire and Willy Kambwala are the only fit centre-backs available, which means Kingdon could make the squad for Bournemouth.",
      "The Manchester Evening News understands Kingdon will take part in training on Friday and that opportunity represents a significant milestone for the youngster.",
      "The 18-year-old has gone from strength to strength and he's started 13 games in the league for United's Under-18s, who are on course to win the title after an excellent campaign. Kingdon, whose natural position is centre-back, has made 21 appearances in total for the academy this season and he's delivered a string of impressive displays in defence.",
      "The youngster, who was born in Bolton, started his career with Greater Manchester grassroots club FC Strikerz Avengers before joining Morecambe at Under-12 level.",
      "Kingdon notably made an appearance for Morecambe's Under-18s when his age group was Under-14 level. United eventually signed the youngster for a six-figure sum in November 2020, following a successful two-week trial period at the club.",
      "The defender played multiple positions at grassroots level, including as a striker and midfielder, but he's since excelled at centre-back and he's considered very strong, pacy and someone who can read the game well from the back.",
      "Kingdon stands at 6ft 1in and briefly played rugby as a child but wanted to prioritise football. He was also a gifted athlete, as he once took gold medals in the 75m, 150m and 600m sprints at the Bolton United Harriers championships.",
      "He has represented Scotland, whom he qualifies to represent through his father, at different youth levels and has worn the captain's armband on occasions.",

      "Man United created a player-coach role in the academy and other clubs, like Liverpool, saw its merit and followed suit.",
      "Tom Huddlestone has provided insight into his player-coach role with Manchester United, which sees him put on his boots again and compete against players much his junior.",
      "United appointed Paul McShane in a pioneering player-coach academy position in the summer of 2021, which involved developing players and giving on-field instructions.",
      "Given that McShane had come through United's academy at the start of his career, he was the perfect inaugural candidate to take up a role that initially raised eyebrows.",
      "The experiment was deemed a success by United and when McShane stepped back from playing and focussed his attention on coaching, a replacement was needed.",
      "That's when former Premier League midfielder Huddlestone, who has played for Tottenham, Derby, Hull and England, was brought into the club to succeed McShane. Huddlestone took up the player-coach role in the academy in August 2022 and those who are unfamiliar with United's youth set-up are still surprised to see him feature for the Under-21s, despite him now coming to the end of his second season in his position.",
      "The hybrid role has been a huge success and even Liverpool have followed suit, with the Merseyside club bringing former player Jay Spearing back into their academy.",
      "Huddlestone scored the winning goal for the U21s against Manchester City at Leigh Sports Village in February and recently sat down with The Telegraph to discuss his position.",
      "\"My initial thought was to keep playing. But none of the offers floated my boat,\" Huddlestone said when asked about his transition into the academy role. \"We’d spoken [Huddlestone and McShane] during the season. He might have thought I was hinting.\"",
      "Huddlestone is involved in planning meetings, setting up and joining in the warm-up for academy players and he'll also lead a section of each training session.",
      "He explained: “Say mine’s a passing drill at the start, I’ll take that and, if I can get my breath back, join in. Then I’m a player helping the lads from within.",
      "“I might have something in my mind needing eight players, but I’m left with two or three. The challenge is finding the balance and the adaptability to still go after the same result.",
      "“So much detail goes into everything. As a player, I took that for granted. I don’t know where I thought the information in team meetings was coming from but it was just there. You don’t realise the hours the staff put in!”",
      "When asked about his future aspirations, Huddlestone said: “Eventually I want to manage. If I didn’t give it a bash after 20 years of playing, I think in my 50s I’d regret it. I’ve seen people jump into jobs too soon – I don’t want to do that.\"",
      "United's U21s play Liverpool at Old Trafford on Friday night and Huddlestone, who currently has a knock, should be present on the touchline with manager Travis Binnion.",

      "It is bad enough Man Utd have six senior defenders out for probably the rest of the month but their problems extend to their academy.",
      "Curiously, no Manchester United defenders were summoned from the academy building on Wednesday for training. The five teenagers who shared the same pitch as the first team were midfielders and forwards.",
      "As invaluable as the recent experiences have been for Zach Baumann, James Scanlon, Jack Fletcher, Shea Lacey and Ethan Wheatley, United's squad resembles the first week of pre-season in a tournament summer rather than the final weeks of a campaign. Erik ten Hag has selected 26 different back fours, personnel-wise, this season.",
      "Including Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka swapping sides with the same centre halves, there have been 27. The number has possibly broken 30 with Ten Hag's right-side/left-side contradictions at centre back.",
      "A team do not get to those numbers through sheer rotten luck. Harry Maguire was coughing and spluttering on his way out of the Community Stadium after 45 minutes at Brentford and if he is the next fly to drop then Casemiro will have to drop back. He looks like he is on his last legs.",
      "United cannot even call upon their most senior reserve defenders. FA Youth Cup winners Rhys Bennett and Sam Murray, both technically on loan at Stockport and Rochdale, played for the United Under-21s against Brighton on Monday night. As they are registered to other clubs, they are unavailable for selection.",
      "The same applies to Sonny Aljofree, loaned to Altrincham in January. Neither Murray nor Aljofree have been named in a National League matchday squad as they have trained primarily with United.",
      "Right back Habeeb Ogunneye and left back Harry Amass also started against Brighton. Ogunneye has been an unused substitute on four occasions already. Joe Hugill and Toby Collyer also kept their tracksuits on during their stints with the first team.",
      "These lads are making up the numbers. A growing injury list (United could be without up to 10 outfield players at Bournemouth on Saturday) and nine players out on loan have granted members of the academy unique work experience less than two weeks before an FA Cup semi-final. Marcus Rashford and Sofyan Amrabat were not visible during training on Wednesday, so two rookies could be on the flight to Bournemouth Airport.",
      "The academy head, Nick Cox, has continuously downplayed the presence of unknown youngsters training with the senior squad. Their presence has increased under Ten Hag.",
      "\"The boys go full-time here at 16. It's always been commonplace but even more so under this manager, our boys will be in and around to support first-team training,\" Cox said.",
      "\"There are probably two versions of support he needs. So the academy provides two services: the academy has got to develop players who can play in that team and the other is to support that team to prepare to win. So recovery days, maybe when he's got a smaller group.",
      "\"We will add to that smaller group so they can have a proper, functional training session. So anyone who's not played, say there are eight remaining players, plus our ten to make a training group so they can have a high-level functional session.",
      "\"But then on a normal training day there'll still be three, four or five lads over there. Some on merit, some just because it's the right positional fit. And the challenge for the boys is to really make a name for themselves. That jump to the first team.",
      "\"Everyone asks me, 'How do you decide? When do you decide?' There's never a day, there's always this movement back.\"",
      "Amass first trained with the first team two months before his promotion to the matchday 20 against Liverpool. Oguneeye's turnaround from training to the bench was only a week. Collyer first rubbed shoulders with Raphael Varane and David de Gea in September 2022.",
      "Bennett was on the bench against West Ham and Wigan over the Christmas and New Year period, He would have been this weekend had he not been loaned to Stockport, where his only start was in a 4-0 thrashing by Tranmere Rovers. He captained Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho with the Under-18s. Those two are fit, at least.",

      "Man United beat Chelsea to reach the Women's FA Cup final but their progress provides a dilemma for new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe",
      "When Marc Skinner leads his Manchester United team out at Wembley Stadium next month, he will do so in the knowledge that it is the biggest afternoon in the club's history.",
      "Less than two decades since the Glazer regime opted to disband the women's team, deeming it not to be part of United's \"core business\", the Reds will have a golden chance to clinch their first-ever piece of silverware as they take on Tottenham Hotspur in the Women's FA Cup final. But, if toppling Spurs would go some way to exorcising some of the ghosts of the club's error-strewn past, then a glimpse at the directors' box on Sunday, May 12, might just offer the clearest insight yet into the landscape of United's future.",
      "Since the installation of Sir Jim Ratcliffe as the club's part-owner in February, there has been little indication from the INEOS chief that the women's team ranks highly on his list of priorities. While he has been spotted in the crowd at Old Trafford on multiple occasions since the turn of the year, he is yet to watch Skinner's side in action at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "With that in mind, his presence at Wembley next month is paramount if players, coaching staff and fans alike are to be convinced of his commitment to their cause. Of course, the fact there is another big game taking place that same afternoon means Ratcliffe's attendance at the national stadium is not a foregone conclusion. Some 200 miles away, United's men's team will also be in action as they host title-chasing Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "With a mere two hours between the two kick-off times, the Reds' new minority shareholder finds himself with a big decision to make: Watch Erik ten Hag's side attempt to upset one of United's major rivals and bolster their chances of European qualification or be there for what might transpire to be the most momentous occasion in the history of the club's women's team?",
      "It sounds like an easy choice but, if Ratcliffe fails to make the right one, it will set the wrong precedent ahead of what many hope will be the start of a brave new era for United Women. The 71-year-old was rather evasive when asked earlier this year about his ambitions for Skinner's side.",
      "\"If it’s a team wearing a Manchester United badge on the shirt, then it’s Manchester United and they need to be focused on winning and being successful,\" he told reporters in attendance at his Knightsbridge office, before suggesting the 'ladies' team could make the switch to a regenerated Old Trafford at some unspecified point in the future.",
      "In fairness to Ratcliffe, overseeing the workings of a football powerhouse like United is a mammoth task. His in-tray almost certainly congested with matters pertaining to the men's team, with questions over the manager's future, the make-up of the playing squad and a potential stadium rebuild among the issues that will likely be occupying his mind at present.",
      "He is, first and foremost, a businessman and thus he will rightly invest much of his time into nurturing the club's biggest money-maker. But, with women's football forecast to be a billion-pound industry within the next decade, neglecting the women's team at this juncture would constitute a real misstep by United's new part-owner.",
      "It has been a turbulent season for the Reds, who currently find themselves fourth in the Women's Super League (WSL), 15 points adrift of league leaders and bitter rivals Manchester City. They are unlikely to qualify to Europe, having this season been knocked out of the Champions League in the first qualifying round, and also bowed out of the Continental League Cup in the group stage.",
      "It marks quite the departure from last term, when United recorded the third-highest points tally in WSL history, taking the title race to the final day before ultimately being pipped to the trophy by Chelsea. Emma Hayes' side also won out in last season's FA Cup final but, after dispatching the holders in the semi-finals at the weekend, there is hope of salvation for United when they face off against Spurs under the Wembley arches next month.",
      "It was a superb display from Skinner's side on Sunday afternoon, with the hosts taking the lead inside 41 seconds at Leigh Sports Village, before veteran striker Rachel Williams added to Lucia Garcia's opener after 23 minutes. Lauren James' strike on the stroke of half-time threatened to spoil United's party but a gutsy defensive showing - plus some superb saves from Mary Earps - saw the Reds hold on to defeat Chelsea for the first time in their history.",
      "\"I will be very clear, we've won nothing yet - it will be an incredibly tough final,\" Skinner said after the game. The United boss, though, will have been the most relieved man in the stadium when the referee blew her full-time whistle, fully aware that the victory could go a long way to enhancing fan sentiment at a time where his future at the club is in jeopardy.",
      "Last week, The Athletic reported that talks are ongoing over a new deal for the 41-year-old that would see him stay in his post beyond this summer. It would be a controversial move, considering United's irrefutable regression this term, but perhaps one that would be vindicated should Skinner get United over the line next month.",
      "Of course, it is not just the manager's future that needs to be addressed in order to turn the Reds into a global superpower. Investment in the playing squad and the stabilistion of the behind-the-scenes structure are among some of the other matters that will need to be addressed if United are to be consistently competing for the continent's top honours.",
      "\"To win a trophy with this club I’ve been at for five seasons would be everything,\" goalkeeper Earps told BBC Sport after the win over Chelsea. \"We’ve got to stay focused on that because it's not going to be an easy game. Hopefully it (will be) ours but we’ve got to earn it. It’s not going to be easy, no way.\"",
      "Perhaps Ratcliffe and co. can take their own learnings from Earps' post-match comments. United do not have a divine right to be an elite women's team simply because of the crest on their shirt. Whatever future success they have will have to be earned.",
      "And, while making an appearance at Wembley would by no means guarantee that success, it would be a pretty good place for Ratcliffe to start.",

      "Manchester United Women's boss Marc Skinner has reportedly been offered a new deal despite the Reds' disappointing season",
      "In a week where two Premier League clubs were hit with points deductions and Liverpool were eviscerated by Atalanta in the Europa League, it is Manchester United who have conspired to deliver what is arguably the most eyebrow-raising football story of the last seven days.",
      "For months it has felt as if Marc Skinner, manager of the women's team since 2021, is on borrowed time. After taking the title race to the final day and reaching the FA Cup final last term, there is a sense his side have now veered drastically off course, with the Reds having had disappointing runs in both the Champions League and Continental League Cup and currently sitting 15 points off leaders Manchester City in the Women's Super League (WSL).",
      "That there remains a chance of FA Cup glory this season offers some hope of salvation for Skinner but the revelation that a new contract could be on the cards for the 41-year-old is being viewed in some quarters as an indictment of the club's long-term ambitions. On Tuesday, The Athletic reported talks are ongoing between both parties as they endeavour to thrash out a new deal that would see Skinner stay in his post beyond this summer.",
      "READ MORE:Mary Earps' Lionesses status under threat as Sarina Wiegman unleashes England's two rising stars",
      "Considering that banners calling for the manager's removal have been visible in United away ends up and down the country since the turn of the year, it feels like a bold and slightly perplexing choice for the club's decision makers to opt to extend his tenure at Leigh Sports Village - particularly as it was hoped the arrival of new part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe would signal a bright new dawn for a women's team that have, until very recently, been treated as something of an afterthought by one of Europe's most behemothic footballing institutions.",
      "The INEOS chief has not gone into any great detail about his plans for Skinner’s side during any of his dealings with the press but there is certainly an argument that rewarding the Reds boss with a new deal would be in opposition with Ratcliffe's desire to make United the best in class in every department.",
      "\"Of course I want to stay,\" Skinner said when quizzed on his future in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"I'm at a club that, not only do I love the history of it, I love what is going to come in the future. It's a club that has fantastic fans, incredible fans. I want to build sustained success over a period of time. That's what the INEOS remit is as well. We want to build success over a long period of time. I'm absolutely on board with that.",
      "\"As soon as any updates are here we will let you know but my job remains firmly in the focus of the team and what we've got to do for the games coming up.\"",
      "Indeed, this weekend's game is irrefutably the biggest of United's season, with the Reds set to host Chelsea in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. A trip to Wembley next month and the chance to yield what would be the club's first major piece of silverware would perhaps help enhance fan sentiment towards Skinner but even that may not be enough to mask what has been something of a calamitous campaign for the Reds.",
      "Last term, United finished the season with 56 points: the third-highest tally in WSL history. They lost only twice and eventually missed out on the title by just two points, with Chelsea also narrowly pipping them to the FA Cup trophy.",
      "It marked the first time the club had finished in the top three and therefore earned a European spot, with Skinner deserving credit for the significant progress made by his side. Fast forward to now, though, and the picture looks very different.",

      "United are almost certain to miss out on a Champions League place this season and exited the continent's premier club competition in the first qualifying round. They have regressed in almost every single metric - with the alarming rate at which they are conceding goals having more than doubled from 0.55 goals per game to 1.28 - and have won just nine of their 18 league matches.",
      "These are not statistics that particularly point to a club on the right path. And, while there's an argument that Skinner has credit in the bank based on what he achieved last term, it could also be debated whether rewarding mediocrity aligns with INEOS' overall vision for the club.",
      "Of course, there are some caveats to United's drop-off in form. In January, Skinner asserted United need to be more aggressive in the transfer market if they are serious about challenging for Europe's top honours. \"If we’re going to chase down Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City,\" he said, \"we’ve got to continue to invest to the levels that they are.\"",
      "Certainly, one look at a list of the 10 most expensive WSL transfers of all time will tell you United have not coughed up quite as much cash as some of their rivals, with summer signing Geyse the only Reds player to feature in that category. Chelsea, meanwhile, have four of the top ten while Man City have three.",
      "Then there is the inescapable truth that United have failed in their mission to tie down some of their biggest names to new contracts in recent times. Alessia Russo and Ona Batlle, two of the Reds' star performers last term, both left in the summer on free transfers after protracted negotiations over new deals failed to bear fruit.",
      "The fact goalkeeper and England No.1 Mary Earps could follow suit when her own contract expires in June seems to indicate the club have not learnt from their mistakes. Another mitigating factor out of Skinner's control is United's desperately bad injury luck, with three of the club's summer signings - Gabby George (ACL), Emma Watson (ACL) and Hinata Miyazawa (knee) - having spent much of the campaign on the sidelines.",
      "It must also be noted that there has been significant disruption behind the scenes at the club, with the departure of assistant manager, Martin Ho, being keenly felt within Skinner's squad. Ho joined Norwegian side SK Brann on a two-year deal in July, while several other key personnel - including physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem and performance analyst Luke Wright - have moved over to join Erik ten Hag's side.",
      "With head of women’s football Polly Bancroft also set to leave this summer to take up a new job as Chief Executive of Grimsby Town, it's perhaps little wonder the Reds have so often appeared in flux on the pitch this term. And Skinner doesn't have to look too far for an example of the benefits of managerial continuity, with Man City currently reaping the rewards of sticking by head coach Gareth Taylor.",
      "The Blues failed to qualify for the Champions League last season but kept faith in Taylor's ability to turn things around. He has repaid that faith by guiding City to the brink of their first league title since 2016 this season.",
      "Still, it is hard to shake the feeling that a shake-up in the dugout would provide United with the best chance of success in the near future, even if United do manage to progress to the FA Cup final this weekend.",
      "“Chelsea is probably the toughest challenge within football,\" Skinner said of Sunday's opponents, \"especially in England.\" While that may be true, it could also be argued that convincing the sceptics of his own managerial abilities looks to be a pretty tough task for the United boss. At present, it seems, he is losing the fight.",

    "body": [
      "Tuesday night marked the first time Earps failed to start a competitive game for her country since September 2022 and the competition for England's No.1 spot is heating up",
      "When the teamsheets were distributed at Dublin's Aviva Stadium on Tuesday night, few will have been surprised to see Sarina Wiegman ring the changes for England's clash with the Republic of Ireland.",
      "The Lionesses' EURO 2025 qualifying campaign had got off to a slightly tepid start with a 1-1 stalemate with Sweden just four days prior and the need for a radical shake-up of personnel was glaring. It was, though, somewhat of a shock to see longstanding No. 1 Mary Earps replaced in the starting lineup by up-and-coming Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.",
      "Earps has been close to an ever-present in this England side for much of Wiegman's tenure. The Manchester United shot-stopper started every game at EURO 2022, helping the Lionesses to clinch their first-ever major trophy, and also starred as they reached the Women's World Cup final last summer.",
      "She is - as her two consecutive FIFA trophies attest to - the best in the world in her position, having only been anointed the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year a few short months ago. And yet, for the first time in almost three years, her selection for England does not appear to be a foregone conclusion.",
      "Instead, it was Hampton who was given the nod against Eileen Gleeson's side and, while there is little doubt Earps would be reinstated between the sticks if England were contesting a major tournament this summer, there is a very real chance it will be a different story next year, when the European Champions will hope to defend their crown in Switzerland.",
      "It was Hampton's first competitive appearance for the Lionesses in two years and the first time Earps had failed to start a competitive game for her country since September 2022. \"It's not down to an injury,\" Wiegman confirmed to ITV before the match. \"I think we're in a very luxurious position that we have two incredible goalkeepers.",
      "\"As we saw with Mary on Friday, she did an incredible job but I also think that Hannah is doing a great job for Chelsea. She's growing into competition with Mary so this is a moment for her to shine.\"",
      "Admittedly, it was not Hampton's finest showing. Though the 23-year-old kept a clean sheet in what was largely a routine England win, there were a couple of occasions where she looked slightly shaky in possession, despite making a decent save from Caitlin Hayes late on.",
      "But the mere fact she was called upon in what was arguably England's most important game since that World Cup final defeat to Spain back in August speaks volumes, and Earps - whose United contract expires this summer - will know she has a battle on her hands to prove she should remain as Wiegman's undisputed No. 1 going forwards.",
      "Of course, the main battleground for the United goalkeeper to state her case will be in the Women's Super League (WSL). It is here where Hampton and current England third-choice Khiara Keating - who was forced to withdraw from this month's camp with a knee injury - currently have the edge over their elder stateswoman.",
      "Though she is yet to win a senior England cap, 19-year-old Keating has been a revelation for Manchester City this term and is currently leading the way in many of the top flight's goalkeeping metrics. According to Opta data, the teenager has prevented more than seven goals that would otherwise have been expected to be scored in the WSL.",
      "Hampton, meanwhile, has prevented just under three while Earps ranks fourth in that category (behind Chelsea's Zecira Musovic) with a score of 0.8. In terms of clean sheets, Keating again leads the way with seven in 18 games.",
      "Earps is just behind her with six, though Hampton has the best clean sheet percentage out of the three, having registered five in just eight WSL matches. Still, when it comes to the ultimate intangibles such as the ability to keep a cool head under pressure and excel for England on the biggest stage, Earps remains peerless.",
      "She is just one appearance shy of reaching the 50-cap milestone for the Lionesses and has kept an impressive 25 clean sheets for her country. In an age where the standard of goalkeeping in the women's game has been a lightning rod for scepticism and derision, Earps has moved the goalposts.",
      "Not content with proving critics wrong on the pitch, she has changed the narrative off it. Those replicas of her England shirt sold out within five minutes of going on sale following her lobbying of sportswear giant Nike is proof enough of that.",
      "\"Of course, she was disappointed because she wants to play,\" Wiegman said when quizzed on Earps' reaction to being benched on Tuesday. \"She has been so good for us and very consistent. Yes, she was disappointed, we had that conversation. Then she just showed up and moved on.\"",
      "Whether Hampton has done enough to convince the England boss to give her a start in May's clash with group leaders France remains to be seen. From an England perspective, the fact that Wiegman now has three credible goalkeeping options to consider is a huge positive as the Lionesses seek to return to the formidable force they were two years ago.",
      "For Earps, though, the focus now must be on finishing the domestic season strongly and showing doubters that, while form may be temporary, class is permanent.",

      "United's dismal campaign continued with a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad on Saturday afternoon",
      "With Manchester United a goal down at the Etihad, manager Marc Skinner turned frustratedly to his bench.",
      "\"Why aren't they keeping the ball?\" he asked his coaching staff as his players struggled to repel the sky-blue tidal wave that continued to make advances toward the United penalty area. His agitation, it seems, was entirely justified as, mere minutes later, his side were 2-0 down and staring down the barrel of their fifth Women's Super League (WSL) defeat of the season.",
      "\"The games that we have left, we will give everything,\" Skinner vowed to the media in his post-match press conference. \"That's what we'll always do, that's what this team is built on, it's what Manchester United is built on.\"",
      "In fairness, Skinner could hardly have been expected to say anything else. Saturday's 3-1 defeat in east Manchester means his team are now 15 points worse off than the league leaders - a fact that only becomes more sobering when you consider it is their city rivals who currently occupy that top spot.",
      "They are six points adrift of Europe, with that gap likely to widen when third-place Arsenal face off with Aston Villa tomorrow. In fact, should Liverpool avoid defeat in the Merseyside derby on Sunday afternoon, United will end the weekend in fifth place.",
      "It is quite the fall from grace for a side who missed out on the title by just two points last term and were only narrowly beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup final. It is fair to say that if the Reds came into this season riding the crest of a wave sparked by their previous successes, then their tumultuous recent form means the club is now well and truly on the rocks.",
      "And perhaps the most frustrating thing about this weekend's defeat is that it was so predictable. Three times since the turn of the year, United have gone into a season-defining game needing to deliver. Three times they have failed to do so.",
      "Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, Skinner's side found themselves two goals down inside 23 minutes. Hayley Ladd clawed one back on the stroke of half-time before Lauren James' third of the day made sure of the victory for the hosts.",
      "Against Arsenal at the Emirates, United went into the break 3-0 down, with Lucia Garcia's stoppage-time goal proving to be little more than a consolation. That the Reds lost again by the same scoreline at the Etihad is a damning indictment of their ability to step up to the plate when the occasion demands it the most.",
      "Maybe the biggest compliment you could pay City on Saturday afternoon, is that they didn't have to play particularly well to get their noses in front. It was United who shaded the first half-hour of the contest before Jess Park's volley gave the hosts the advantage.",
      "It must be said that any consternation in United's ranks would have been justified, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "\"I actually felt we played well in large parts of the game,\" Skinner said. \"The first goal shouldn't even exist as a goal, she's offside. The difference between smaller and big stadiums is when there are more fans momentum swings quicker. The second and third goal we've got to be better for.\"",
      "Certainly, it's hard to refute the United manager's assertion that the goal changed the game. And, just eight minutes later, Park had made it two, deftly prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box.",
      "On that occasion, Skinner and his players only had themselves to blame. That Park - who has proved herself to be one of the most capable players in the league in recent months - was afforded so much time and space in the penalty area will surely be one of the biggest talking points when the Reds begin their post-match post-mortem at Carrington on Monday morning.",
      "So too will the fact that City were able to carve United open so easily just seconds into the second half, with Park turning provider this time as Shaw finished coolly past a dejected Mary Earps.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. But, as they did against Arsenal and Chelsea, the Reds had left it too late and were left to rue yet another missed opportunity to take their stuttering season off life support.",
      "Of course, there are some mitigating factors for this underwhelming campaign. Any team in world football would struggle to seamlessly replace the considerable talents of Ona Batlle and Alessia Russo, who left the club last summer for Barcelona and Arsenal respectively. Injuries have also played their part, with summer signings Gabby George and Hinata Miyazawa both having endured lengthy spells on the sidelines.",
      "But ultimately, United have just simply not been good enough. Fingers will rightly be pointed at the manager but the players must also take accountability ahead of a summer that will be crucial in shaping the club's future.",
      "Certainly, if the rest of the season is to be viewed as an audition for a long-term place in Sir Jim Ratcliffe's United regime, then Skinner and his squad must now hope for a flawless end to the campaign. \"Pressure makes you stronger,\" the Reds boss said. \"This club will rise to the levels we all want. I’m a fighter so I’m going to put myself in a position where I can make this team the best in the land. That’s my personal responsibility.\"",
      "In many ways, Skinner's defiance is admirable and speaks to a manager who has never shied away from the added pressures that come with presiding over a United team. But, no matter how valiantly he is battling to secure his future at the club, it very much feels like he is currently losing the fight.",

      "Jess Park scored a brace in Manchester City's 3-1 win over Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium",
      "If this is to be viewed as Jess Park's breakthrough season at Manchester City, then it was against Manchester United at the Etihad where she truly came of age.",
      "When big-money summer signing, Jill Roord, ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) back in January, it was hard not to fear that the Blues' title charge might start to veer drastically off course. But Park, who joined City as a winger in 2017, is relishing her newfound responsibility in the no. 10 role and has inspired Gareth Taylor's side to huge wins over Chelsea, Arsenal and now United.",
      "For the lifelong City fan, who grew up aiming to follow in the footsteps of Sergio Aguero, it simply doesn't get much better than this; netting a brace against your arch-rivals to send your club - at least temporarily - top of the Women's Super League (WSL) table. Boyhood City fan Phil Foden did the same for men's side against United earlier in March, winning at the Etihad by the same scoreline - and now it was Park's turn.",
      "It is worth noting that it was only a few short months ago that United took to the pitch at Old Trafford two points better off than their city rivals, hoping to maintain their unbeaten start to their league campaign and truly assert themselves in the title race.",
      "Perhaps that afternoon, which ended with the visitors celebrating in front of the East Stand, was the turning point; the moment where the gulf in quality between the two sides first became apparent and the significant chasm that now separates them in the table first began to forge.",
      "Certainly, the landscape heading into this weekend’s showdown at the Etihad was very different. This time, it was advantage City, with the Blues bidding to end the day three points clear of the indomitable Chelsea ahead of their clash with West Ham United on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United, meanwhile, travelled to east Manchester as the would-be disrupters. A win at the home of their noisy neighbours would not quite abate the simmering frustration sparked by what has been a largely underwhelming season, but stopping City from winning a first WSL title since 2016 would at least go some way to tempering the supporters’ angst.",
      "Indeed, even Blues boss Taylor couldn’t find a way to diminish the magnitude of the contest for his side. “Every game is so important because the margin for error is really tight,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"Any kind of dropped point here or there can be quite damaging. We don't underestimate any game. But I probably have to agree (that this is) one of the biggest derbies.\"",
      "And maybe it was the high stakes that contributed to City's subpar start on Saturday afternoon, with United enjoying the best of the early chances in M11. First it was Nikita Parris who came close, drawing a fine save from Khiara Keating, before Brazil international Geyse drilled an effort just wide of the post.",
      "City, though, are always dangerous, even when they are not at their best. And it was Park who fired the first warning shot, taking aim from 25 yards out and forcing Mary Earps to smother the ball to safety.",
      "United still had their moments, most notably when Lucia Garcia's deflected effort had to be tipped over the crossbar by Keating. But City grew in stature with every passing second and took the lead in the 37th minute when Leila Ouhabi teased the ball into the path of Park, who volleyed brilliantly past Earps.",
      "There may have been some justifiable consternation in the United ranks, with replays showing Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw was offside in the build-up. But with no VAR to intervene, the goal stood and, from that moment on, it was hard to imagine the visitors getting back into the game.",
      "And so it proved, as - just minutes after Shaw saw her strike correctly ruled out for offside - Park had made it two, prodding the ball home after Alanna Kennedy's lofted pass into the box. The England international was given a heroes reception as she made her way down the tunnel at half-time, while Taylor turned to give a triumphant fist pump to the crowd.",
      "But the job was not done yet and it quickly became clear City had no intention of taking their foot off the gas in the second half, with Shaw finding the back of the net mere seconds after the restart. The Jamaican, who finished coolly after a perfectly-weighted through ball from Park, had managed to cement herself as City's top-scorer before the VIPs in the Colin Bell stand had even had the time to finish their half-time pies and return to their padded seats.",
      "Hannah Blundell's strike, which deflected off Kerstin Casparij 17 minutes from time, opened the door for the unlikeliest of late United comebacks. However, while Marc Skinner's side enjoyed the lion's share of possession in the final quarter, City's defensive fortitude won out, ensuring the hosts won the day in front of a 40,086-strong crowd.",
      "\"It's always felt like (this could be our year),\" Taylor said when quizzed on the possibility of his side winning the title this term. \"When we started the season, our first game at West Ham was very good and you start to see things the team.",
      "\"Obviously there's a long way from that point to where we are now and full credit to the players and the group behind the group to get us to this position. It's taken a lot of hard work, a lot of trust. The most important thing now... is not to worry too much about anything else and control what we need to control.\"",
      "On Park, the City boss added: \"The cherry on the cake we've been looking for with Jess has been goals and assists and she gave us that today on a big stage. Her performance was good, with and without the ball she drives really well and gives us a lot of energy and a lot of quality.",
      "\"Jess has stepped into the opportunity really well. When you think about how patient she had to be, she's done really well.\"",
      "Certainly, Park will have been delighted to have seen England manager Sarina Wiegman in the stands to take in her exceptional display. With the European Championships to come next summer, the 22-year-old is surely edging ever closer to a starting spot in the Lionesses team. But, if City can carry this momentum into the final run-in, Park and her teammates might just be celebrating a different trophy in a couple of months' time.",

      "Plus: Jamie Redknapp praises Man Utd's double scorer Bruno Fernandes, but says Casemiro \"looked like he's in Soccer Aid\"; Man Utd equalised after Adam Smith was penalised for handball; a late Ryan Christie penalty was ruled out by VAR for the foul coming outside of the box",
      "Sunday 14 April 2024 12:31, UK",
      "Erik Ten Hag admitted Man Utd \"didn't deserve more\" than their 2-2 draw at Bournemouth as Andoni Iraola bemoaned refereeing decisions against his side - including two penalty calls.",
      "Man Utd twice came from behind to earn a point at the Vitality Stadium but were second best for much of the contest.",
      "Defensive errors and sloppy play, particularly in the first half, allowed Bournemouth to dominate. But two goals from Bruno Fernandes - the second after a harsh penalty against Adam Smith - saw the visitors take a point back to Manchester.",
      "\"We are into the final stage of the season and this is not enough. But the truth is today, we didn't deserve more,\" Ten Hag told Sky Sports after the game.",
      "\"In the end, if you allow them so many chances in the first half, as a team you don't deserve more. You have to take control, don't give chances and score goals for yourself.",
      "\"It's up to them... In this moment, with all the problems we have, we played to our levels and did very good to our levels.",
      "\"But you have to do it throughout the game, right until stoppage-time, and the last four games we dropped points from winning positions. Today, we were in losing positions and fought back.",
      "\"But coming into losing positions is totally unnecessary. We lost the ball three times in the areas where we should not lose those balls. They [United's players] were not always well-organised, especially on the right side where there came some gaps for the opposition to benefit from it. We should have done this better.",
      "\"Second half, we took more responsibility and we closed that side... [There were] individual mistakes, we have players who can do better with the ball. On the right side, go with your opponent, that is your job, close it. It's a small part in it, it's about collaboration, but the main part is discipline.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp on Saturday Night Football:",
      "\"Fernandes has got a lot of stick from people and some of it I get. But I also think it's unfair.",
      "\"I see a player that genuinely cares. Sometimes, there is pettiness and calling out his players, but he is the sort of player you'd be looking to build the team around. He's a player, he makes things happen.",
      "\"Where the frustration comes from is that people don't care as much as he does. It's like an epidemic at the club. Do people care? Do they do enough? Do they go flying into tackles?",
      "\"Fernandes does and sometimes gets himself into situations he shouldn't. But he cares about the club, the team, he's got his team back into the game today.",
      "\"I don't see too many others right now showing the appetite he does. I see multiple Champions League winners walking around the pitch sometimes like they don't care, and you can't have that.",
      "\"I've watched Casemiro for years and he's one of my favourite defensive midfield players in football, I've loved watching him play.",
      "\"But right now, it looks like he's in Soccer Aid. He's playing the game at such a pace where it's a bit of fun and there's celebrities coming on - no, this is the Premier League.",
      "\"I think to myself 'what would Rodri do?' and he'd be flying to help his team-mates. And that's what he should be doing.",
      "\"At the moment, Casemiro is not setting the right examples to the young players around him. It isn't good enough.\"",
      "Bournemouth boss Iraola believes his side deserved all three points from a game they largely dominated - but added refereeing decisions were not kind to them.",
      "He told Sky Sports: \"We cannot finish and be happy with the point. You always have to give importance to a point against Man Utd, but I think we were the team who deserved the three points.",
      "\"We missed the chances especially in the first half and I think we could have gone in at half-time with a better result, but also in the second half.",
      "\"But the reason we didn't win was because we missed the chances and all the refereeing decisions went against us.\"",
      "Christie penalty overturned by VAR",
      "Late in added time, Ryan Christie was fouled by Willy Kambwala, with referee Tony Harrington pointing to the spot. However, a VAR review decided the foul took place outside the area.",
      "Iraola said of the incident: \"Completely [a penalty], because if you saw the penalty we conceded against Newcastle, we started pulling two metres outside the box, he goes inside and it's a penalty.",
      "\"If you put it in one frame, he's probably one centimetre outside the box. But he continues stopping the player one or two metres inside. It's not just one kick and then boom [it's a foul]. He goes with Ryan Christie one or two metres inside the box. For me, it's obvious.\"",
      "According to The FA’s Laws of the Game (Law 12.3):\n\n\n\"If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Redknapp added: \"I think once Kambwala steps out, it's almost irrelevant because once you're holding him, you're stopping him running into the box and that's where I thought this wasn't going to get overturned.",
      "\"It's like a rugby tackle, he uses his arm… he's just got to run him down the side.",
      "\"I was amazed it got overturned. I get that it's outside the box, but it's the fact he was travelling into the box which is why I think it should have been given.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Izzy Christensen said: \"I thought that [contact outside the box] initially and I stand by that.",
      "\"There's contact, of course there is. Kambwala has had to step and he's stepped at exactly the right time that it's not in the box. Six inches deeper and it's a stonewall penalty. Christie is clever in the way he nicks the ball past Kambwala.",
      "\"Because he [Kambwala] is square and Christie runs into him, you have to wonder what he can do, he's going to hit him as he runs into him.\"",
      "Smith penalised for handball",
      "Man Utd equalised for a second time after the break as Smith was penalised for handball. A shot from Kobbie Mainoo hit Christie before deflecting onto Smith.",
      "While Iraola said that \"normally they don't call these kinds of handballs\", both Redknapp and Christensen believed it was a penalty, pointing to Rashford's positioning.",
      "Christensen said: \"The way that it evolved was very unfortunate for Adam Smith - and the way the deflection takes place.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has a key part to play in this because of his position. Rashford is lurking and Smith knows that.",
      "\"Smith moves his body towards the ball and his reaction says it all. He knows he's moved his arms slightly towards the ball as he's adjusted his body.",
      "\"It's harsh - but for me, it's a penalty.\"",
      "Redknapp added: \"It's a twitch. That's how things react sometimes. Of course we don't want to see these given but in the current climate with the way football has moved with handball, I've seen a lot worse given.",
      "\"You can see there's the slightest movement from Adam to put his right arm out. If Marcus isn't behind him, he finds his way out, let's the ball run across his body and clips it up the line.",
      "\"It felt like a slight panic and slight movement and that's all it took. It was never going to be overturned.\""

      "Match report as Manchester United Women set up FA Cup final showdown against Tottenham after goals from  Lucia Garcia and Rachel Williams seal surprise victory over Chelsea; Emma Hayes' side reduced deficit on stroke of half time through Lauren James",
      "Monday 15 April 2024 09:54, UK",
      "Manchester United advanced to an FA Cup final against Tottenham after holding out for a historic 2-1 victory over holders Chelsea at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "In a rematch of last year's final, which they lost 1-0, Marc Skinner's United went in front in the first minute through a Lucia Garcia header before doubling the advantage midway through the first half when Rachel Williams headed home.",
      "Former United player Lauren James pulled a goal back just prior to the break and the visitors did most of the attacking thereafter but were unable to force extra-time, with Mary Earps making a superb save to thwart James and substitute Catarina Macario hitting the bar.",
      "The result is a first victory for United over Chelsea since the team's launch in 2018 - and they now have a chance to secure a maiden piece of major silverware when they return to Wembley on May 12 to face Spurs, who beat Leicester in the other semi-final earlier on Sunday.",
      "Chelsea, meanwhile, saw a trophy bid end for the second successive game, having lost 1-0 to Arsenal in the League Cup final last time out.",
      "They remain in the hunt for the Women's Super League - currently topping a table in which United lie fourth - and the Champions League, with a semi-final first leg in Barcelona to come next Saturday, as they seek glory in their final few games before boss Emma Hayes departs to take charge of the United States.",
      "United made a dream start as they grabbed the lead in the opening few seconds, Chelsea full-back Eve Perisset being punished for losing possession with Leah Galton claiming the ball on the left and delivering a cross to far post, where Garcia headed in.",
      "And after unsuccessful attempts at the other end from James and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, the hosts then extended their advantage via another header teed up from the left, Ella Toone this time providing the delivery and veteran forward Williams, brought into the starting XI for Nikita Parris, nodding past Hannah Hampton.",
      "Williams had the chance to make it 3-0 soon after but could not get her shot on target, before James fired into the side-netting.",
      "Chelsea subsequently exerted further pressure as the interval drew near, and following a header from Mayra Ramirez going wide and Earps doing well to turn one from James around the post, the latter halved the deficit as she fired in from Niamh Charles' cutback.",
      "Earps - who was dropped to the bench for England's win over the Republic of Ireland on Tuesday, with Hampton playing in her place - then pulled off an even better save to keep out another James header six minutes into the second half.",
      "As Chelsea continued to hunt a leveller, Rytting Kaneryd's claims for a penalty were dismissed after she struck the ball against Katie Zelem, and Earps was in action again to deny Erin Cuthbert and James.",
      "The verdict was no penalty again after a Williams collision with Charles, and Chelsea were then inches away from equalising as Macario's curling corner connected with the bar.",
      "Stoppage-time saw a Parris strike saved by Hampton and fellow substitute Aggie Beever-Jones shoot into the side-netting as Skinner's team sealed a ground-breaking triumph.",
      "Man Utd goalkeeper Mary Earps told BBC:",
      "\"It feels so good, this season has been so hard. It's been mentally brutal but I'm so glad. We're in the final and it's one more game to go. Let's go.",
      "\"We're been lacking aggression in our games this season and we gave this one a real go. It's heavy when things don't go your way in the league and it's been difficult.",
      "\"It was ugly, it was horrible, but we don't care as we won. It was really gritty and it just means so much.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Marc Skinner told BBC:",
      "\"We said all week that we were going to have to suffer. Chelsea have an abundance of talent in every position and they can bring more on. So we knew we would suffer.",
      "\"Tooney said to me in the first half, 'Mark I'm doing dog ears,' and I said 'Yes, we need to,' it is part of these types of games. To beat a Chelsea team like this you have got to dig in. Every player played their part, from the starting XI to the players that came on, the magnificent fans, everyone did their bit.",
      "\"As a coach these are the real moments that make it worthwhile. When you feel the collective energy of a team like Manchester United it makes you feel alive. These players performed alive today and that is why we won the game.\"",
      "Chelsea boss Emma Hayes told BBC:",
      "\"You can't defend as a team like that and expect a maximum result. It changes the course of the game. A mistake in the first minute doesn't help a side. These things happen in football.",
      "\"We dominated the ball and the attacks. We get a goal at half-time. Back in the game, Mary Earps produces a couple of world class saves and it was our turn to be on the receiving end of not getting the big refereeing decisions today.",
      "On going out of the FA Cup: \"I'm grateful for everything. I've been unbeaten in four years, that's an unbelievable record. As always I'm reflective on what I need to do. Congratulations to Manchester United. Their fans but in a great shift for them and as a team they performed at a good level and just congrats to them.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes twice hauled Manchester United level at Bournemouth as Erik ten Hag's side grabbed a barely-deserved 2-2 draw that further decreases their Champions League hopes.",
      "United had conceded at least 28 shots in their last three matches and, while they weren't quite as open at the Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth will no doubt regret missing the opportunity to complete a Premier League double over their visitors.",
      "The Cherries were the better side throughout the first half and led when Dominic Solanke punished Willy Kambwala's slip to fire the hosts ahead, only for Fernandes to slam in a volley from short range against the run of play.",
      "Bournemouth restored their advantage when Justin Kluivert capitalised on more questionable United defending but United were level again when Fernandes rolled in a penalty after Adam Smith was penalised for an unfortunate handball.",
      "Bournemouth then saw a stoppage-time penalty for a foul on Ryan Christie by Kambwala overturned, with replays showing the offence occurred just outside the area - although the contact continued into the box.",
      "According to IFAB's laws of the game, \"if a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.\"",
      "It was another fortunate break for United, who ended the game with an expected-goals-from-open-play total of just 0.39 and conceded 20 shots.",
      "The point leaves them seventh - 10 points off the Champions League places with just six matches left to play.",

      "After injuries to Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans forced him into action, Kambwala earned praise for his performance in the 2-2 draw against Liverpool - despite United facing 28 shots on goal.",
      "But in just his third Premier League start, the 19-year-old endured a chastening evening, which began when he was outmuscled by Solanke before losing his footing as the striker powered a confident finish beyond Andre Onana.",
      "In truth, it was Alejandro Garnacho who deserved most of the blame after gifting possession to Bournemouth. The winger was replaced at half-time and may be facing an awkward conversation with Ten Hag after liking social media posts criticising the substitution. He later unliked the posts.",
      "Bournemouth came close to doubling their lead through Milos Kerkez and Luis Sinisterra, before Fernandes' volley levelled the scores.",
      "But Kambwala was in the spotlight for Bournemouth's second just four minutes later, leaving far too much space between himself and Diogo Dalot, into which Kluivert sprang before drilling a finish inside Onana's near post.",
      "There was still time in the first half for Kerkez to miss two huge chances - with United's defenders simply standing and watching - and for Onana to deny an unmarked Kluivert.",
      "Fernandes - who clipped the bar in first-half stoppage-time - remained United's only threat and took the chance to score his second when Kobbie Mainoo's deflected shot inadvertently caught Smith's arm.",
      "United deserve credit for restricting Bournemouth's threat in the second half - but it looked like that work had been undone when Kambwala obstructed Christie deep into stoppage time.",
      "But referee Tony Harrington - who also experienced a tough afternoon - was advised to overturn the decision. The official followed that advice without going to the monitor, and Enes Unal failed to hit the target from the resulting free-kick.",
      "According to The FA’s Laws of the Game (Law 12.3):\n<br>\n<br>\n“If a defender starts holding an attacker outside the penalty area and continues holding inside the penalty area, the referee must award a penalty kick.”",
      "United may have held onto a point but they are now winless in four matches and have conceded nine goals in the process - not an ideal demonstration of Ten Hag's merits as Sir Jim Ratcliffe assesses the best way forward at Old Trafford.",
      "Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola was furious at referee Tony Harrington's performance, saying \"all the decisions\" went against his side.",
      "\"We cannot be happy with the point,\" he told Sky Sports. \"We were the team that deserved three points.",
      "\"We missed chances, especially in the first half. But the reason we didn’t win is because we missed the chances and all the refereeing decisions went against us.\"",
      "Iraola was disappointed with the decision to punish Smith for his inadvertent handball, saying: \"It comes from his own team-mate and it’s instinctive. Normally they don’t call these kind of handballs.\"",
      "The Cherries boss was even more frustrated with the decision by Jarred Gillett, the VAR, to advise Harrington to overturn his decision to award Bournemouth a late penalty, explaining: \"The first frame, he is maybe one centimetre outside the box but he continues stopping the player one or two metres inside. It’s obvious.\"",
      "Iraola also questioned why Christie was booked for diving after Diogo Dalot made contact with him in the second half, whereas Kobbie Mainoo was not penalised for simulation earlier in the game.",
      "\"In the first half, Kobbie Mainoo dives and it is not a yellow card,\" said Iraola. \"In the second half, there is contact on Christie and it is a yellow card for diving. What’s the reason?",
      "\"We need the same respect as other teams. All the teams are playing for important things and it’s cost us a lot of hard work.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Joe Shread:",
      "It's hard not to feel sympathy for Andoni Iraola. While referee Tony Harrington made several questionable calls, it was unfortunate for Bournemouth that most of those decisions did not go their way.",
      "While Willy Kambwala's foul on Ryan Christie in stoppage-time began outside the area, he clearly brought the Cherries midfielder down inside the area.",
      "IFAB's laws state that, if a foul continues into the box, a penalty should be given. It was curious that VAR Jarred Gillett did not even recommend Harrington reviewed the decision at the monitor - he simply advised him to change his mind.",
      "Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the penalty Adam Smith conceded is that Harrington technically made the correct decision. IFAB says that a handball occurs when a player “touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger.”",
      "Smith had no intention of making contact with Kobbie Mainoo’s shot after it deflected in his direction, but his arm was extended away from his body.",
      "However, Iraola is right to say those kind of handballs are often not given in the Premier League. And just because the laws as they are currently written say it should be a penalty, it doesn’t mean that is right, or even that it is good for the game.",
      "Should a player accidentally brushing the ball with their arm while minding their own business on the edge of the area really result in a nearly 80 per cent chance of scoring?",
      "The handball law remains broken - and Bournemouth suffered because of it.",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag admitted his side did not deserve to beat Bournemouth and criticised his players' first-half performance.",

      "\"There were clear jobs to do there and they were not always being done. The first goal was a very good setup for our side but then we lost control of the ball - it should not happen.",
      "\"We have players that can do better with the ball. On the right side, just go with your opponent. We have jobs to do.",
      "\"We have a team that is resilient. Twice we fought back from losing positions that were totally unnecessary.\"",
      "United are now 10 points out of the Champions League places and Ten Hag said: \"This is not enough, we know that.",
      "\"Today, we didn’t deserve more. If you allow them so many chances in the first half, you don’t deserve more. You have to take control.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Joe Shread:",
      "For once, even Erik ten Hag didn’t try too hard to defend Manchester United’s performance.",
      "As United somehow conceded 87 shots in their last three matches against Brentford, Chelsea and Liverpool - and picked up a total of two points - the manager sought to find the positives from what his players produced.",
      "But after United allowed another 20 shots against Bournemouth, Ten Hag criticised his side for their sloppiness in possession, as well as failing to carry out their jobs in defending their right flank.",
      "Interestingly, Ten Hag withdrew right winger Alejandro Garnacho - who was partially responsible for Bournemouth’s first goal - at half-time. Casemiro’s work-rate also drew the ire of Jamie Redknapp, who likened his output to that witnessed in a charity match.",
      "Ten Hag also admitted his side did not deserve to take a win from their visit to the south coast. How could he when they produced just 0.39 expected goals in open play?",
      "It is now six Premier League matches since United recorded more shots than their opponents. They have failed to win on their last four outings, conceding 11.73 expected goals in that time - compared to just 3.94 in their favour.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe ready to oversee his first off-season at Old Trafford, Ten Hag is running out of time to suggest he should be part of United’s new era.",
      "Bournemouth travel to Aston Villa on Sunday April 21 in the Premier League; kick-off 3pm.",

      "Saturday 13 April 2024 21:58, UK",
      "Anthony Gordon was instrumental in Newcastle's 4-0 win over Tottenham at St James' Park. It was his strength when pressing that sparked the shift in momentum in the build-up to the opening goal. Destiny Udogie had the weight advantage but was still outmuscled.",
      "Gordon picked out Alexander Isak with the pass, scored the second himself within two minutes and even provided the cross for Fabian Schar to make it four late on. An emphatic win and an emphatic performance from the former Everton winger.",
      "This was the first time that he has been involved in three goals in a single Premier League game and he now has more goal involvements than anyone in home matches this season. It should be enough for Gareth Southgate to take him away to Germany this summer.",
      "But this Newcastle win owed as much to Eddie Howe's tactics as any individual performer. It was impressive how he was able to nullify Tottenham's build-up play through their inverted full-backs, even changing his own team's defensive shape to do exactly that.",
      "\"Tottenham are unique in what they do and we felt we needed to change to give ourselves the best chance of what we wanted to do. I thought tactically it worked, it was a really good delivery from the players, they always deserve the praise for the execution.\"",
      "Those players, Gordon among them, will receive praise following such a stunning result. But this was a big day for Howe too, his tactical acumen winning the day.Adam Bate",
      "Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou said ahead of his side's clash with Newcastle that there was \"no reason\" for him to watch last season's 6-1 defeat at St James' Park.",
      "In hindsight, maybe he wishes he had.",
      "The heavy defeat back in April - Newcastle were 5-0 up after 21 minutes - proved to be the end of Spurs bid to qualify for the Champions League last season, and the big defeat this time around could prove just as damaging to their hopes this year.",
      "Spurs were second best in every department against Newcastle as Eddie Howe tactically outthought Postecoglou. The switch to a back five worked wonders for the hosts, who countered at will against a lacklustre Spurs.",
      "The 4-0 scoreline sees Postecoglou's side drop to fifth on goal difference, with Aston Villa, who face Arsenal live on Sky Sports on Super Sunday, moving up a place to fourth without kicking a ball. And with England's hopes of pipping Germany in the race for an extra Champions League spot set to go down to the wire, Spurs Champions League qualification hopes remain firmly in the balance.",
      "It doesn't get any easier for Spurs. They now have to stew until April 28 when they face north London rivals Arsenal, live on Sky Sports before games against Chelsea and Liverpool.Oliver Yew",
      "Each of Tottenham’s last three Premier League defeats by 4-plus goals have come against Newcastle at St James’ Park – also 1-5 in May 2016 and 1-6 in April 2023. Indeed, they’ve now lost by 4-plus goals against Newcastle more often than they have vs any other opponent in Premier League history (five).\n\n\nSpurs have now conceded 61 Premier League goals against Newcastle at St James’ Park, only conceding more at one away venue in the competition (64 at Anfield).\n\n\nNewcastle have scored 93 Premier League goals against Tottenham, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition. Meanwhile, today was their first home clean sheet against Spurs in 18 home league games, since a 4-0 win in December 2003.",
      "For once, even Erik ten Hag didn't try too hard to defend Manchester United's performance.",
      "As United somehow conceded 87 shots in their last three matches against Brentford, Chelsea and Liverpool - and picked up a total of two points - the manager sought to find the positives from what his players produced.",
      "But after United allowed another 20 shots against Bournemouth, Ten Hag criticised his side for their sloppiness in possession, as well as failing to carry out their jobs in defending their right flank.",
      "Interestingly, Ten Hag withdrew right winger Alejandro Garnacho - who was partially responsible for Bournemouth's first goal - at half-time. Casemiro's work-rate also drew the ire of Jamie Redknapp, who likened his output to that witnessed in a charity match.",
      "Ten Hag also admitted his side did not deserve to take a win from their visit to the south coast. How could he when they produced just 0.39 expected goals in open play?",
      "It is now six Premier League matches since United recorded more shots than their opponents. They have failed to win on their last four outings, conceding 11.73 expected goals in that time - compared to just 3.94 in their favour.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe ready to oversee his first off-season at Old Trafford, Ten Hag is running out of time to suggest he should be part of United's new era.Joe Shread",
      "It's hard not to feel sympathy for Andoni Iraola. While referee Tony Harrington made several questionable calls, it was unfortunate for Bournemouth that most of those decisions did not go their way in their 2-2 draw with Manchester United.",
      "While Willy Kambwala's foul on Ryan Christie in stoppage-time began outside the area, he clearly brought the Cherries midfielder down inside the area.",
      "IFAB's laws state that, if a foul continues into the box, a penalty should be given. It was curious that VAR Jarred Gillett did not even recommend Harrington reviewed the decision at the monitor - he simply advised him to change his mind.",
      "Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the penalty Adam Smith conceded is that Harrington technically made the correct decision. IFAB says that a handball occurs when a player \"touches the ball with their hand/arm when it has made their body unnaturally bigger.\"",
      "Smith had no intention of making contact with Kobbie Mainoo's shot after it deflected in his direction, but his arm was extended away from his body.",
      "However, Iraola is right to say those kind of handballs are often not given in the Premier League. And just because the laws as they are currently written say it should be a penalty, it doesn't mean that is right, or even that it is good for the game.",
      "Should a player accidentally brushing the ball with their arm while minding their own business on the edge of the area really result in a nearly 80 per cent chance of scoring?",
      "The handball law remains broken - and Bournemouth suffered because of it.Joe Shread",
      "It felt like Jeremy Doku was everywhere for Manchester City. Doku here. Doku there.",
      "City did do a lot of attacking against Luton - as the 393 passes in the final third proves. And Doku was at the heart of the constant pressure towards Thomas Kaminski's goal. He recorded 23 touches in the Luton box - that's the most of any player in any game this season. Two of those actions led to a goal.",
      "First when dancing past Fred Onyedinma, whose tired legs could no longer resist the urge to have a nibble, and Erling Haaland stroked home the penalty. Doku then grabbed the goal his exhibition of dribbling deserved with a masterful solo effort.",
      "Pep Guardiola had described the Belgian as shy during the early stages of his Manchester City career. He's now craving attention - and defenders don't know how to deal with his direct and dazzling feet.Lewis Jones",
      "Before Burnley's game with Brighton, assistant manager Craig Bellamy vowed his side would continue their way of playing and not change their methods in the face of relegation. Come full-time, he may be rueing those words.",
      "Burnley, with their possession-based style of play despite having an inferior-quality playing squad compared to most, have been too nice this season in terms of their lack of ruthlessness and easiness to play against.",
      "But then there was hope. Josh Brownhill's opener against Brighton briefly put them four points away from safety with a big game away at Sheffield United to come next week. Survival was still improbable but the great escape was very much on.",
      "Then came Muric's mistake - a costly lack of concentration from a safe back-pass - and that hope was gone.",
      "While it was a costly individual error, Burnley's way of playing was partly to blame - Muric made 94 touches against Brighton, the most by a Premier League goalkeeper in the last eight seasons.",
      "Yes, Muric should do a lot better in the moment, but trying to play out the back with 10 minutes to go in a must-win game is part of the process at Turf Moor - when it shouldn't be.",
      "This lack of streetwise attitude is why Burnley are likely to be in the Championship next season.Sam Blitz",
      "I Am Maximus romped to victory in the Grand National, and while Brentford would eventually win here at a canter, they did so without their own gladiator. Ivan Toney remained in the stable, an unused substitute.",
      "Having only been called upon against Aston Villa last weekend after Ollie Watkins' late equaliser, you begin to wonder just how much more will we see of Toney in a red and white shirt.",
      "Injured or not, Thomas Frank knows he has to start preparing his players for life without their talisman. Frank's attack was still not quite at full throttle, but here they still carried more than enough potency to extend Sheffield United's abysmal away record.",
      "The Blades, still without a clean sheet on the road, were unable to capitalise on Toney's absence.",
      "The striker is on his lengthiest Premier League goal drought, having amassed 21 shots and 36 touches in the opposition box during seven consecutive starts prior to his omission at Villa Park.",
      "\"Ivan Toney was ill during the week, and his hip injury is still not perfect,\" Frank said afterwards. \"Now we have time to get him ready for Luton and I'm convinced he will be ready.\"",
      "No Toney, no problem for Brentford? Not quite, but if he is to be sold as expected this summer, the return of Kevin Schade to fitness alongside Bryan Mbeumo means it would be smart management to use him sparingly in the remaining games - regardless of his fitness.Ben Grounds",
      "How Wolves have missed Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian was injured early on against Brentford in February, having scored twice in the win over Chelsea in the previous match. He delivered another two goals on his return to the starting line-up at Nottingham Forest.",
      "The first of those goals was a fine example of what he brings that others cannot. A powerful run from deep, a smart turn to elude the defender and an emphatic finish. His second was an atypical poacher's effort to take his Premier League total for the season to 11.",
      "It was not enough to win the game for Wolves. Cunha was withdrawn with the game in the balance, a nod to the fact that he is still ahead of schedule - the initial prognosis for his muscle injury was that he should still be on the treatment table, not the pitch.",
      "Gary O'Neil may still be wondering what might have been had he felt able to call upon Cunha for the FA Cup quarter-final against Coventry when teenager Nathan Fraser was asked to lead the line instead. With Cunha back, Wolves are always able to pose a threat.Adam Bate",
      "Grudge and grievance bubbled beneath the surface. How Nottingham Forest would have loved to get the better of their Midlands neighbours in league competition for the first time since 2018.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White taunted the Wolves fans that used to applaud him after scoring his fifth league goal of the campaign. Had Forest gone on to win the game, clawing themselves three points clear of the drop zone, the entire episode would have been justified.",
      "But goading his former employers was perhaps a little ill-advised given what actually transpired five minutes later - a Matheus Cunha equaliser. Gibbs-White does, however, remain key to Forests' survival hopes and their future is crucially in their own hands.",
      "The importance placed on upcoming games against Everton, Sheffield United and Burnley is increasing by the week. Five games to rescue a season.",
      "Forest have fight, that's for sure. But do they have enough quality, consistency and nerve to stand up in games against direct relegation rivals, with the consequences so grave? Not so sure.Laura Hunter",

      "Man Utd goalkeeper Andre Onana on his tough start at Old Trafford: \"You have to be strong. You have to survive, use your opportunity, use your moment, and start to shine again\"; Watch Bournemouth vs Man Utd on Sky Sports Premier League from 5pm on Saturday, kick-off 5.30pm",
      "Saturday 13 April 2024 17:51, UK",
      "During the savage criticism that coloured the first six months of his Manchester United career, Andre Onana's head never dropped, his spirit remained unbroken.",
      "The goalkeeper refused to hide and insisted on taking responsibility.",
      "He wanted to front up every error, and admit he was not yet operating to his own standards, rather than having his team-mates or Erik ten Hag explain that on his behalf.",
      "Bruno Fernandes felt Onana was shouldering too much of the blame for what was ultimately collective failings, and as captain, stepped in to stop him from becoming a shield.",
      "The team wanted to protect the Cameroon international, but he was refusing to allow some bad moments to reframe his entire journey.",
      "Onana left his village in Mefou-et-Akono at 10, moving four hours away to join the Samuel Eto'o Academy. At 14, he was exposed to a new continent, language, culture, and way of life in Barcelona. He'd have to adjust again aged 18 when Ajax signed him.",
      "Onana became an international at 20, a Europa League finalist the following year, and a Champions League semi-finalist aged 23.",
      "At 24, he fought a doping ban which still robbed him of football for nine months - despite the Court of Arbitration for Sport finding \"no significant fault\" against him.",
      "Onana hurdled that with poise, delivering the Supercoppa and Coppa Italia for Inter, whom he helped steer to last year's Champions League final against victors Manchester City.",
      "The struggles, sacrifices, and successes since his formative years have offered a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"In life, everything is temporary and so you have to find a good balance,\" Onana tells Sky Sports ahead of United's Saturday Night Football clash with Bournemouth.",
      "\"Not too high, not too low… I knew six months before, I was seen as the best. Then it can be that in six months, everything changes and you just have to deal with the situation.\"",
      "Staff at Carrington who would ordinarily be concerned by a new player making mistakes and being met with widespread abuse, were instead marvelling at Onana's strength of character.",
      "The 28-year-old has been described as \"the biggest positive influence at the club,\" but his humility sees him redirect the compliment to the goalkeeping department.",
      "\"We are in this together,\" Onana, United's reigning player of the month, says. \"I want to thank Tom [Heaton], Altay [Bayındır], Richard [Hartis] and Craig [Mawson]. It's been a difficult time, a difficult situation, a difficult start for me.",
      "\"We have to protect each other, especially when things are not going good.",
      "\"They were there with me. They told me, 'Andre, listen, we know who you are. We were sitting in front of the TV, we were watching you playing the Champions League semi-final. You were almost close to winning against City in the final.",
      "\"'So we all know who you are. Take your time. Most of the keepers who have been here at Manchester United had difficulty in the beginning.'",
      "\"These are the kind of messages they were giving me, and the players also helped me so much.\"",
      "Onana didn't mind the scathing takes in the final months of 2023. \"Critics are a part of life, especially when you reach this kind of level,\" he shrugs.",
      "\"And especially being United goalkeeper after coming from Inter as the best. When you are new at a club, the expectation is high. If you're lucky to have a good start, everything is quite easy.",
      "\"When you don't have a good start, you have to be strong. You have to survive, use your opportunity, use your moment, and start to shine again.\"",
      "It's simple maths to calculate why Onana is so beloved at Carrington. He is a measured thinker and exudes a natural warmth in his interactions.",
      "His fluency in Spanish, French, English, Italian and his understanding of Dutch marks him the 'golden thread' of the dressing room.",
      "Onana has been a sounding board for the youngsters around the first team, and has particularly shepherded 19-year-old Willy Kambwala.",
      "He has also been a saving grace for United in recent months, as they stacked the unwelcome status of having conceded the most shots of any team in Europe's top-five leagues.",
      "\"If this year is a price to pay, I'm ready,\" Onana says, circling the club's defensive injury crisis which has prompted them into a low-block approach that invites pressure.",
      "\"Last season, Manchester United didn't concede so many shots. But I don't think it's a big issue because at the end of the day, football is about goals and now we are scoring a lot. We'll receive some against us sometimes, but we have defenders that work hard and we will do everything to block the shots.",
      "\"It's the risk we take because we are a very offensive team with the quality we have in front.\"",
      "Injuries have forced United into 31 different combinations at the back this season, which surely impacts a goalkeeper's consistency?",
      "\"Well, it's quite easy when you're used to playing with the same back four,\" Onana concedes but adds: \"We are Manchester United, so every player around the first team has the level to belong here.",
      "\"Unfortunately we have a lot of injuries but that is an opportunity for others - like Willy, he was brilliant for us.",
      "\"Being a goalkeeper is a position with a lot of responsibility. You have to be ready to play with anyone and… I can't complain. Of course, when you are used to playing with the same line, it's the best, but at the moment we don't have that.",
      "\"So we just have to deal with the situation, stay positive and look forward.\"",
      "Onana strays into Roy Keane territory, labelling the sea of shots he has to deal with as \"just doing my job, it's why they brought me here,\" but he talks about \"being more dominant with the ball\" and assisting the attack.",
      "Was the long kick out to Bruno for Marcus Rashford's beauty in the Manchester derby a prime example?",
      "\"Yes, one example, but not only that,\" Onana says. \"It's also to give more confidence to the players, let them know I'm the spare man and when we have the ball, I'm the one who has to find the free men.",
      "\"When you play against big teams, sometimes they go one against one, sometimes you have pressing from the No.10… so you have to recognise these kinds of situations and you have to make a decision. I'm here to take that responsibility and give confidence to my players.\"",
      "Onana declines to pick out a game for United which has showcased his best attributes because he doesn't feel he has reached full stride yet. He does have a favourite experience though: the FA Cup quarter-final victory over Liverpool at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was crazy,\" he puffs. \"I was in shock. It was just beautiful to be there. The noise, it was so loud. The joy… wow!\"",
      "Onana wants that feeling to be the norm for United fans, and he'd like Ten Hag to be the man who delivers it.",
      "\"Football doesn't have a memory,\" he says. \"You deliver good today and yesterday, tomorrow you don't deliver good and they are always going to remember what you did last. And unfortunately, you can't change that.",
      "\"Erik is a very good manager. I'm not here to back him because he's already big enough to back himself. He did great things for United last season. But this is football and I always say football is temporary. It is about moments, we have to know how to deal with the bad period because what we are facing this season in terms of injuries, I never saw that in my life…",
      "\"You know, we have more than 35 injuries. It's not an excuse, especially being a United player, but these are the things you have to deal with. You cannot hide. That is reality.",
      "\"We are doing everything to turn the situation. And it will turn, I'm sure a hundred percent.\""

      "Jones Knows has spotted a betting angle to exploit in the first halves of Man City, Liverpool and Arsenal's games this weekend.",
      "Alexander Isak, see me in my office.",
      "The Newcastle striker's failure to score for Newcastle at Fulham meant both bets last weekend went into the Sky Bet satchels.",
      "All eggs were in his basket and it proved a foolish move on my part. The both teams to score and over 2.5 goals in Tottenham and Nottingham Forest landed - as did Axel Disasi to make a foul vs Sheffield United but no Isak, no party in terms of the 13/2 treble. His failure to trouble the scorers also meant the Isak to score twice punt at 10/1 went tumbling into the abyss. Two points lost. And lessons learned, you'd assume.",
      "Or not.",
      "I'm keeping the faith with Isak. Time to repay that faith, Alexander.",
      "This bet lands if Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool score six or more first-half goals between them this weekend against teams they are 1/12, 1/5 and 1/5 to win this weekend.",
      "This bet gets me excited for many reasons. Not only is it a great one from an entertainment perspective as it will have some sort of chance of landing heading into the Arsenal game at 4.30pm on Sunday, but we're also playing a line that looks very attractive to me. All three teams are in a busy spell with big European matches on the horizon in midweek, especially Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "I think there's a strong chance of both managers wanting their side to rack up a comfortable lead in the first 45 minutes against Aston Villa and Luton to save some legs for midweek. It could lead to dull second halves, like Arsenal produced in their 2-0 win over Luton recently. And Liverpool will surely be in reaction mode after what happened on Thursday night. Crystal Palace could feel that force in the first half.",
      "Isak's price just can't be ignored again in Newcastle's clash with Tottenham where goals look almost guaranteed.",
      "Spurs (81%) and Newcastle (71%) sit first and third when it comes to percentage of their Premier League games going over 2.5 goals so a goals-based bet has to be considered. Isak is that play.",
      "He's scored 10 goals in his last 14 appearances and Isak's goals per 90 rate is the fourth best of any player in the Premier League at 0.70. In a goal-heavy game, he can get in on the act.",
      "We're dealing with two of the worst attacks in the Premier League since December when Burnley and Brighton met. If you take out matches against Sheffield United since December, Burnley have scored 17 goals in 18 matches - 0.94 goals per game whilst if you remove Sheffield United from the equation again, Brighton have scored just 13 goals in their last 15 games across all competitions. Under 2.5 has to be the play at the prices.",
      "Any opportunity we get to back both teams to score around Evens should be gobbled up this season in the Premier League. It's a bet that has landed in 62.9 per cent of games - a huge increase on the average from the last five seasons of 50.66 as the goal rush in this league continues to flow at never-before-seen levels.",
      "Well, the price for it to land in Liverpool vs Crystal Palace is 5/6 and it looks a confident selection to hopefully bring home the treble on Super Sunday.",
