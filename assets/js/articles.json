      "Rasmus Hojlund has made it clear that team success with Napoli is his top priority, even with his ongoing drought in front of goal. The Manchester United forward, currently on loan at the Serie A club, is set to make a permanent move to Italy next summer.",
      "Hojlund, who made 95 appearances for United after joining from Atalanta in August 2023, netted 26 goals during his stint at Old Trafford, but struggled to maintain a consistent scoring record. Ruben Amorim's side agreed a £38.8 million deal with Antonio Conte's team, which would see Hojlund make a permanent switch after his loan spell, provided the Italian club secure a Champions League spot.",
      "Last season saw Napoli crowned as Serie A champions, and they're keen to defend their title this season. They're currently second in the league table, trailing AC Milan only on goal difference.",
      "Despite a promising start in Naples, Hojlund has managed just four goals in 13 matches across all competitions, while also providing two assists. The 22-year-old bagged a brace against Sporting in the Champions League in October, but hasn't found the back of the net in the Italian top flight since scoring against Genoa in the same month.",
      "However, Hojlund has been instrumental in his last two games against Atalanta and AS Roma, setting up goals in both matches and helping his team secure a crucial six points in the title race. Speaking to DAZN after providing the assist for the winner against Roma, Hojlund commented: \"Obviously, I'd like to score a lot of goals again and start doing so soon, but it's important to always contribute to the team, and I'm happy to help.",
      "\"I try my best to be useful. I consider myself a - myself a team player: winning is more important than scoring goals.\"",
      "While nobody could doubt Hojlund's commitment during his spell at Old Trafford, his goal drought forced United into action in the summer transfer window. Amorim's squad bolstered their attacking options with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo, and the moves appear to be paying dividends with United now in contention for European qualification.",
      "Initially reluctant to depart United and eager to prove himself, Hojlund ultimately made the switch back to Italy, with Antonio Conte playing a crucial role in convincing him.",
      "\"Conte is a top coach,\" he explained. \"I came here because I knew this was an important step for me. Napoli is a great club and a wonderful place to live. It's exactly what I need right now in my career.\"",
      "Conte had previously heaped praise on the promising forward following his goal against Genoa in October, stating: \"He's a 22-year-old who was on the sidelines at Manchester United.",
      "\"He has significant room for improvement. He needs to work because he has the potential to become a star, and he's proving it.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sergio Aguero has emphasised the importance of Marcus Rashford's inclusion in England's squad for the 2026 World Cup. The Manchester United player, currently on loan at Barcelona, has become a staple in the Three Lions' line-up since Thomas Tuchel took the reins earlier this year.",
      "Rashford's latest outing for England saw him notch an assist in a 2-0 victory over Albania. Now, he'll be aiming to maintain his impressive form in Spain as he vies for a spot at the World Cup.",
      "Speaking about Rashford's performance in La Liga, Aguero told Stake: \"I think Rashford is doing very well. He's scored goals, provided assists and looks very well adapted to the team.",
      "\"He has been among those called up by Tuchel and has had minutes. Who will be starter only Tuchel knows. Just being in the squad is very important.\"",
      "Since joining Barcelona, Rashford has netted six goals and set up seven more in his first 18 matches across all competitions. The Catalan giants are currently leading La Liga, one point ahead of arch-rivals Real Madrid.",
      "Despite the thrill of moving to Spain's second city, Rashford had previously revealed what he was most looking forward to - playing at the Camp Nou.",
      "Upon finalising his loan move, Rashford expressed: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",
      "\"Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "Rashford's dream came true on Saturday when he made a second-half appearance in Barcelona's match against Deportivo Alaves. This was the club's second game at the newly refurbished stadium, with Rashford missing the inaugural match due to illness.",
      "The legendary venue has been undergoing renovations since 2023. During this period, Barcelona hosted their 'home' games at the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium, which has a capacity of 55,000.",
      "The goal for the revamped Camp Nou is to boost its seating capacity to 105,000. However, for the first two matches back, attendance was limited to 45,000. The renovation project is estimated to have cost around £1.25 billion.",
      "Last month, Rashford returned to a Premier League pitch when Barcelona took on Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge, a match that Enzo Maresca's team won comfortably 3-0. Back in September, the 28 year old had shone on English turf when he scored a spectacular double at St James' Park in a 2-1 victory over Newcastle.",
      "Barcelona are not scheduled to play any more English teams in the Champions League group stage, but a knockout round encounter remains a possibility, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool all in fine form.",
      "On the domestic front, Rashford will be focused on helping Barcelona clinch consecutive La Liga titles. If his stellar performances in Spain continue, a permanent move could well be on the cards.",

      "Players mocking managers has become something of a regular occurrence at Manchester United. Patrick Dorgu is the latest Red Devils star unable to resist a social media dig at his boss after 'liking' an Instagram post that questioned Ruben Amorim's tactics last month.",
      "Dorgu was dropped for Sunday's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace, although Amorim insisted the decision was purely football-related, highlighting the Dane's nervousness in possession in recent games. He said: \"He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touched the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.\"",
      "Regardless of the reasons for Dorgu's dropping, players making gestures about their managers is unhelpful at best and divisive at worst. But it's not charted territory for a United boss.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho landed himself in hot water with Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, for similar behaviour. Garnacho had 'liked' a post on X which criticised Ten Hag for substituting him at half-time during United's 2-2 draw at Bournemouth during the 2023/24 season.",
      "Ten Hag played down the issue but confirmed the player had apologised. The Dutchman said: \"Alejandro is a young player, he has to learn a lot. He apologised for it and after that we move on.\"",
      "Garnacho clearly didn't learn from his mistake - or just didn't care - when he slammed Amorim's decision to leave him on the bench for last season's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Perhaps knowing his United career was coming to an end anyway, he fumed in a post-match interview: \"Up until the final, I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "To compound the issue, Garnacho's brother and agent, Roberto, supported his comments with a pointed social media message. He posted on Instagram: \"Working as no-one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha.\"",
      "It was therefore a surprise to no one when Garnacho left for Chelsea in a £40million in the summer. While the Argentine has struggled to establish himself as a first-team regular, he is part of a Blues squad that looks capable of challenging Arsenal for the title.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim is still striving for consistency at United ,with the 1-0 loss to 10-man Everton and the excellent 2-1 win at Palace summing up their season so far. United host West Ham on Thursday.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay does not appear to have any regrets about his move away from Old Trafford. He issued a 13-word statement after winning the Serie A Player of the Year award at the Gran Gala del Calcio awards on Monday night.",
      "\"Coming to Napoli was an easy choice, I came to the right place,\" he said after winning the award, as reported by The Sun. McTominay was a key figure in Napoli's Serie A title success last season, with 13 goals and six assists in all competitions for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "His fine form at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium saw him win the Serie A MVP award for the 2024–25 campaign. The Scotland international's first season away from Old Trafford was a huge success and he's carried that on into this season, helping Scotland qualify for the World Cup in 2026.",
      "Speaking at the award ceremony on Monday night, the former United midfielder would hail his special bond with Napoli after his move in 2024. He said: \"It’s sensational, it’s incredible to be here and win this award.",
      "“Thank you to everyone, the team, the staff, and my teammates. My bond with Napoli is special, there are so many special places here.\"",
      "The 28-year-old, who made 255 appearances for United and scored 29 goals, was also named in a star-studded Serie A top XI. Current Manchester City midfielder Tijani Reijnders was named in the squad along with Inter Milan stars Alessandro Bastoni and Federico Dimarco.",
      "United supporters have been questioning the decision to sell McTominay after his brilliant start to life in Italy, with the club bringing in just £25million from his sale. Former United boss Erik ten Hag cited the need to comply with PSR as the reason behind the midfielder's departure.",
      "\"He was so important for our team,\" Ten Hag said. \"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales, and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It’s not the right thing to do but, for everyone, for all parties, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it.",
      "\"Of course, for Napoli. (They are getting) a very good player. But also for us (it’s a good deal too).\"",
      "However, the reported £25million deal now looks a bargain for Napoli and McTominay would have been an ideal candidate to play in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. McTominay will be back in action with Napoli in the Coppa Italia clash with Cagliari on Wednesday night.",

      "Manchester United are back in victory lane after securing a hugely valuable 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Sunday. However, even Selhurst Park decider Mason Mount wasn't expecting to convert the decider.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes made the surprise decision to tee up Mount for the winning striker rather than have a crack himself. And it was a call that even caught Mount off-guard as he recounted his moment of triumph in south London.",
      "Fernandes' free-kick finesse is well-known among fans by this stage, but United's captain stepped aside for the crucial clincher at Palace on Sunday. Or rather, he stepped up to take control of the situation before watching on as Mount delivered when the team needed him most.",
      "Making his first start in more than a month, Mount was as surprised as anyone else to see the ball had been laid off for him to hit on the edge of Dean Henderson's box. One could tell by his reaction that his skipper had caught him unaware, not that the quality of his strike gave that impression.",
      "\"We always have a little conversation,\" said Mount while recapping his pre-set-piece chat with Fernandes. \"I said to him, 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said, 'You stay there,' and then I said, 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it... He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react, and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption, and then hit the target.\"",
      "He did precisely that, and the splintered Palace wall couldn't protect Henderson's near post as the decider bobbled home. The result was enough to move United up to seventh and just four points behind bitter rivals City in second place.",
      "Speaking of the Manchester rivalry, United and City appear to be on a collision course next year concerning the signature of Elliot Anderson. That's after it was reported City are ready to step up their interest in the Nottingham Forest star.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been linked with a steady string of midfield recruits over the last year. And after the buzz surrounding the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba has died down, Anderson has taken over as United's supposed No. 1 recruit.",
      "However, the Daily Mail reported City are escalating their interest to ensure Anderson doesn't fall into the clutches of fellow admirers United or Liverpool. It's suggested Forest want in excess off £80million for the player, though a January move looks highly unlikely.",
      "Newcastle begrudgingly sold Anderson to Forest last year in order to comply with Premier League spending laws. A little more than one year on, and it looks as though the 23-year-old could fetch up to three times that fee.",
      "United could well part ways with Casemiro in the summer when his contract, which has a 12-month extension clause, is due to expire. There are also major question marks around the future of Kobbie Mainoo, whose sale could help United challenge City in the race for Anderson.",

      "Without their summer signing, United suffered a disappointing defeat to ten-man Everton, but bounced back impressively with a 2-1 victory away to Crystal Palace last Sunday. Goals coming from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount at Selhurst Park could mean Cunha starts on the bench for his comeback game.",
      "Amorim will undoubtedly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad though, and it's clear the player himself is also delighted. Via an Instagram story with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he stated: \"Back back back.\"",
      "In terms of a possible fresh injury blow, there was concern over Bruno Fernandes as he was seen limping towards the end of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemed to confirm that the Portuguese midfielder would be fine to play in future matches.",
      "\"It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.\"",
      "The Portuguese manager will certainly require his captain's presence during the upcoming hectic period, as United face their most congested fixture list since their Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "After hosting the Hammers, United make the trip to Molineux to face Wolves next Monday night before welcoming Bournemouth for another evening fixture a week later. Their final match before Christmas sees them take on Aston Villa, followed by a Boxing Day encounter at St James' Park against Newcastle United.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is expected to make his first start in more than nine months during this run of fixtures, having made a brief substitute appearance in last Sunday's match against Palace.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko remains sidelined with a knee complaint sustained during the Tottenham Hotspur fixture, while Harry Maguire continues his recovery from a muscle injury picked up in that same encounter.",
      "Amorim provided updates on both players during last week's press conference, indicating that while returns could be imminent, neither player is quite match-ready.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time. It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him,\" he said. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time].\"",
      "However, despite these cautious remarks, the Slovenian international has not experienced any complications and remains on course to feature in the Wolves fixture later this month.",

      "Manchester United flop Andre Onana has hit his lowest ebb yet, having been left out of Cameroon's squad for the African Cup of Nations. The goalkeeper joined Turkish side Trabzonspor in the summer after falling out favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "And while he has been in better form recently, that has not been enough to see Onana earn a reprieve when it comes to Cameroon. Onana has been left out of his nation's squad for the upcoming AFCON tournament.",
      "The 29-year-old has collected 53 caps for his country so far and played every minute during the African side's World Cup qualifying campaign that ultimately ended in failure. AFCON gets underway on December 21, with Cameroon set to take on Gabon, Ivory Coast and Mozambique in the group stage.",
      "Onana's axe comes on a dramatic day for Cameroon, with manager Marc Brys having been sacked just days before the tournament gets underway.",
      "Onana has made 11 appearances for Trabzonspor so far this season in all competitions. His performances have however reportedly been good enough for club chiefs to make a move for him on a permanent basis.",
      "Speaking earlier this season, Amorim said on his goalkeeper's loan departure: “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder.",
      "“You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it’s hard to point why. It’s the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Onana started his career with Dutch side Ajax before moving to Italian giants Inter Milan. He went on to become one of Europe's standout goalkeepers during his time in Serie A.",
      "His form was good enough to convince the Red Devils to pay £43m for his services in 2023. He spent two seasons as United's number one, albeit high-profile mistakes blighted his game at Old Trafford.",
      "He was eventually allowed to leave the club this summer and was replaced by Senne Lammens, who joined United from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian has enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford despite just one clean sheet in his opening seven games.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed - albeit in jest - that a beloved children's television personality influenced his choice to undergo a medical procedure. The football legend disclosed on his BBC podcast that CBeebies' favourite Mr Tumble played a role in his vasectomy decision.",
      "On the most recent instalment of 'The Wayne Rooney Show', the 40-year-old Manchester United legend admitted he couldn't bear watching the programme with another child. \"I hate Mr Tumble,\" he said.",
      "\"I was in the dressing room for Match of the Day and he was sat next to me. The reason I hate him, well I don't hate him for what he does, is just that I've had to sit through it four times with every kid.",

      "The admission left the studio audience roaring with laughter - as football content creator Steve Bracknell in turn joked: \"There's your headline! Mr Tumble made me have the snip - Rooney.\"",
      "Podcast listeners also shared their own difficulties with the programme.",
      "Rooney underwent the procedure in 2018, not long after welcoming their fourth son, Cass, into the world. During 2023, Coleen confirmed they both believed their family was now complete.",
      "\"Me and Wayne talking about him having a vasectomy,\" she said. \"He said after this baby that's it, we're not having any more, and Wayne went in and got the snip - so I knew for sure we wouldn't have anymore children.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Rooney's eldest son, Kai, is following in his father's footsteps at United's academy.",
      "The 15-year-old has shown promise at youth level and could, potentially, make his bow at Old Trafford in the near future. Kai can play as a striker or winger.",

      "Manchester United have been told they were harshly treated after Jean-Philippe Mateta was permitted to retake his penalty, despite his own error, during their 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon. Ruben Amorim's men netted twice after the half-time break to secure a crucial three points, although not before drama surrounding Mateta's spot-kick.",
      "A clumsy challenge by Leny Yoro on the Palace striker handed him an opportunity to break the deadlock from the penalty spot. Mateta coolly converted his effort, with Senne Lammens diving the wrong way, but replays revealed the ball had accidentally brushed his left foot.",
      "VAR directed Rob Jones to announce to the stadium that Mateta would be permitted to retake the penalty. He said: \"After review, Crystal Palace No.14 touches the ball accidentally twice as the ball goes into the net. The final decision is a retaken penalty.\"",
      "\"What they decided now is because it's accidental and he's scored it's a retake. If he missed, it would've been an indirect free-kick. I think it's only fair. He doesn't mean to slip.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Jay Bothroyd has explained why United should feel aggrieved by Mateta being granted a second opportunity after his blunder. \"I don't agree with that,\" he added.",
      "\"You step up to take a penalty and you plant your foot and touch the ball, it's bad technique. If you take a bad touch, it's just a bad touch. He's planted his foot ahead of the ball and has cut across it.",
      "\"That's his fault. He shouldn't get the opportunity to take it again for his mistake.\"",
      "Had this situation occurred last season, it would have been deemed a missed penalty by Mateta, but Julian Alvarez's contentious double-touch in Atletico Madrid's Champions League shoot-out defeat to Real Madrid prompted Ifab to enter talks with UEFA.",
      "The regulation has since been amended to specify if an accidental 'double-touch' spot-kick finds the net, then it should be retaken rather than disallowed. Fortunately, it didn't prove too crucial, with Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount both finding their mark to swing the match in United's direction.",
      "The triumph at Selhurst Park provided the ideal response to their home defeat against Everton on Monday night, despite enjoying a man advantage for more than an hour. With Palace having featured in France just days before, Amorim acknowledged that factor contributed to their success.",
      "He said: \"It was small details that helped. The pace and intensity was better in the second half. I could see that Palace were getting tired at the end of the first half and knew they would suffer if we scored.",
      "\"We went on to control the game well away from our goal and in the opposition's half. We controlled the game well, but just have to be careful about what we did in the first half.\"",

      "Gary Neville has been accused of ‘killing’ Scott McTominay’s career at Manchester United by Jamie Carragher. The Red Devils academy graduate made 255 appearances for his boyhood club before making a shock move to Italian giants Napoli.",
      "McTominay has shone during his time in Naples, scoring 18 goals in 53 appearances in all competitions. He claimed the Italian title in his debut season and was named the best player in Serie A. Ex-United star Neville has claimed that it might have been an error letting him leave.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Neville said: “What’s happened to Scott McTominay? Have we made a massive mistake?”",
      "Fellow pundit Jamie Carragher replied: “You’ve killed another Man United player, that’s what happened. Too much criticism, [saying] he’s not good enough.”",
      "Ian Wright then chimed in as he said: “I remember Gary saying they’ve got to get rid of him. Poor Scott. He just wanted some freedom.”",
      "However, Neville then insisted that he wasn’t as critical as others thought and suggested that McTominay should have been kept. He added: “I didn’t say he wasn’t good enough… Not me. Seriously I never thought they should have got rid of him. I always said at the time, he’s a squad player, in the 15 or 16. He should never have been got rid of.”",
      "Despite his defence Neville had indeed been critical of McTominay on a number of occasions in the past. Speaking in 2018, he suggested that the Scottish international may have to consider changing his position in order to have a career at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: “McTominay, when I watch him, I’m not sure he’s actually good enough on the ball to be a Man United midfield player.",
      "“I do think he’s the type that it’s good for him to play games in there – but I do wonder whether if actually he’s got more of a position at centre back eventually, the physicality that he has. He’s a big lad. Is he sharp enough on the ball to be a Man United central midfield player?”",
      "McTominay could potentially be celebrating a second league title come the end of the season. Having helped Napoli to the Italian crown last term, Antonio Conte’s men sit second and are only behind leaders AC Milan on goal difference this time around.",
      "McTominay has actually been linked with a move back to the Premier League on a host of occasions. Everton have recently been credited with an interest. His deal with Napoli is set to run until 2028.",

      "Taking his place in a box in the stands, the Brazilian was present to watch his side earn an impressive 2-0 victory, thanks to goals from ex-West Ham midfielder Pablo Fornals and Sergi Altimira.",
      "Antony, who joined Betis on a permanent deal this past summer after his six-month loan, was spotted supporting his team via footage taken from the stands. The winger was seen taunting the home fans when celebrating one of Betis' goals at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.",
      "Videos posted across social media platforms showed Antony shouting and raising his arms at Sevilla fans, who retaliated by throwing bottles and other objects at his box. Other fans could be seen gesturing their middle finger at the footballer in what was a fierce atmosphere that eventually boiled over on the pitch.",
      "With Betis 2-0 up and just eight minutes left to go, Sevilla winger Isaac Romero was shown a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on Betis's Valentin Gomez. Romero being given his marching orders only led to further chaos in the stands with bottles and other projectiles being thrown on the pitch.",
      "The rising unrest led referee Jose Luis Mubuera Montero to suspend the game. Proceedings were halted for 15 minutes before the two teams returned and played out the final few minutes of the clash.",

After leaving United this past summer, the winger said: \"What happened in Manchester, only I know how difficult it was.\"",
      "With six goals in 13 games already this season, the Brazil international has played a huge role in Betis' recent ascendancy but his ill-discipline almost flared up again during their Europa League match against Utrecht.",
      "In the Thursday night game, Antony very nearly picked what would have been a second consecutive red card when appearing to headbutt his opponent, Souffian El Karouani.",
      "The Utrecht left-back went down clutching his head, but the Betis ace escaped a caution. The clash was then sent to review by VAR, but the officiating team also cleared Antony of any punishment.",

      "Despite being unable to hit the ground running at Old Trafford, the 25-year-old ultimately thrived on Spanish soil at the back end of 2024/25, racking up nine goals and five assists across all competitions for the club. As a result of his fine form, Betis opted to make his transfer permanent this summer, securing Antony on a fee of around £21.5million.",
      "This season so far, Antony has managed another six goals and three assists for his new club, in 13 appearances across La Liga and the Europa League. And while he has enjoyed a career turnaround at the Estadio Benito Villamarin, a Spanish football expert has now explained where he believes it all went wrong at United for Antony.",

      "\"Most of them preferred he didn't play. The manager didn't have any faith in him. So when he gets off the plane at Betis and there's a whole host of supporters there waiting to greet him, and the manager picked him and told him how important he was, I just think his self-esteem was back.",
      "\"And he can play. It can be a bit of a joke; 'Oh, Anthony, the league can't be very good if he's scoring goals, blah, blah, blah'. But he's a really good player. He's the second most popular player at Betis, though he's never going to overtake Isco.\"",
      "Gibson had the pleasure of watching Real Betis in the flesh this weekend, on co-commentary duty for Premier Sport 1 as the club ran out 2-0 winners over Sevilla. Pablo Fornals opened the scoring for the club in the second-half, before Sergi Altimira sealed the deal with around 20 minutes left to play.",
      "However, Antony was not included in Pellegrini's squad for the derby, as a result of sustaining a red card against Girona on November 23. In that incident, Antony attempted a late overhead kick, missing the ball completely and accidentally kicking Joel Roca in the head.",
      "While he was initially only shown a yellow card for it, the referee upgraded it to a straight red after a VAR review. As a result, he missed the all-Seville showdown weekend.",
      "It comes as Gibson also highlighted potential problems with Marcus Rashford securing a permanent switch to Barcelona next summer. The 28-year-old is currently enjoying a season-long loan under Hansi Flick at Barcelona, after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",
      "And with the Catalan giants holding an option to make the move permanent come season's end, Rashford's future could be set at the Camp Nou. However, Gibson has highlighted that Barca might struggle to raise the funds, given their struggles in that area.",
      "He said: \"It's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally. But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up.",
      "\"And then Barcelona, before too long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Rashford will hope to make an impact in Barcelona's clash with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night, after appearing as a second-half substitute against Alaves this weekend. Barca currently top the La Liga table, just three points ahead of Diego Simeone's side at present - and they will hope to expand that gap when the two teams meet at the Camp Nou.",
      "FC Barcelona vs Atletico de Madrid is available for fans in the UK to watch live on Premier Sports 1, from 7.55pm on Tuesday night.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "When Kobbie Mainoo was playing for England in a major tournament final at the age of 19, Carlos Baleba had just finished a quiet first season at Brighton, starting only 15 Premier League games. In the North East, Elliot Anderson started just 10 games for Newcastle that season, having only just broken into the England Under-21 squad.",
      "Adam Wharton was at least with Mainoo in Germany during Euro 2024. However, while Mainoo came into the team and started every knockout game, Wharton was left kicking his heels, unable to get on the pitch during the tournament.",
      "Fast forward 18 months, and Baleba, Anderson and Wharton are all being touted as £100million players who might hold the key to transforming Manchester United's midfield. In an ideal but probably unrealistic world, two of them might end up at Old Trafford next summer.",
      "This wasn't how it was supposed to pan out for Mainoo. Anderson is now a key cog in England's midfield and Wharton started in place of the Nottingham Forest man in the Three Lions' last World Cup qualifier. Mainoo, on the other hand, hasn't played for his country since September 2024.",
      "The problem for Mainoo is that the gap is growing. In the summer of 2024, everyone expected the Stockport-born youngster would be the solution to United's midfield woes, but under Ruben Amorim, that doesn't look likely right now.",
      "This season, Anderson has played 1,170 minutes of Premier League football, Wharton has 869 minutes in the league and Baleba has 701 minutes. Mainoo? Just 171 minutes. Development is often a numbers game, and Mainoo is being left behind.",
      "He hasn't started a single Premier League game so far this season and you have to wonder when that is going to change. He isn't going to get any better as a player for 15 or 20 minutes here and there, and nothing that is happening in training seems to be convincing Amorim at the moment.",
      "Mainoo's future is rightly a hot topic amongst United fans. A number of academy graduates have been moved on recently and the 20-year-old has often been the only link keeping the club's proud 88-year record of having an academy product in every matchday squad going.",
      "There is also a feeling that he is being underused by Amorim and deserves more than a chance. But if that isn't forthcoming, then a loan move in January might well be the best option for both parties. Mainoo's development has stalled because he isn't playing football.",
      "It will probably sting the player himself to see contemporaries being linked with a move to United to fill a position he had seemed to nail down in the 2023/24 season. If he wants to prove to Amorim that he can still be a player of the quality of Baleba, Anderson or Wharton, then he needs the game time to do so.",
      "If that isn't forthcoming at United, then letting him go elsewhere to get games in the second half of this season might well be the solution. It doesn't have to be the prelude to a permanent departure, but it could allow Mainoo to rebuild his form and confidence, and give him a platform to show that he can be part of Amorim's midfield rebuild as well.",

      "It was no surprise to see Luke Shaw offer a hug and a few words of encouragement to Lisandro Martinez when the Argentine replaced him at Crystal Palace on Sunday. If anyone in this Manchester United squad knows what it is like to go through an injury nightmare, it is Shaw.",
      "Martinez was making his return to action after almost 10 months on the sidelines following an anterior cruciate ligament injury and replaced Shaw as United looked to see out a morale-boosting win at Selhurst Park. It was the fourth time in a couple of years that Martinez has suffered an injury that has kept him out for a prolonged period of time.",
      "The Argentine will hope those days are now behind him and in Shaw, he has an example of how fortunes can change. The England international has seen his Old Trafford career regularly put on hold as a result of fitness problems, but at the age of 30 he is back to his best.",
      "Shaw is as fit as he's been in his United career and has started all 13 Premier League games this season. After missing almost all of last season through injury issues, it was a renaissance nobody really saw coming.",
      "That run in the team will almost certainly continue against West Ham on Thursday night, with Martinez unlikely to be considered fit enough to start just yet after so long out injured, but it's only a matter of time until the 27-year-old is back in the side. Despite his own injury issues, to many, he will be one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "A back three of Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Martinez looks strong, with Shaw and Harry Maguire in reserve. The likelihood is that Martinez and Shaw will be competing for the same spot on the left of the back three, as the only left-footed central defenders.",
      "With not many games to go round, one of them could end up being frustrated, although as we've seen, Ruben Amorim is happy to swap his centre-backs during games.",
      "Another option is to use Shaw at wing-back. He was excellent there for England during the European Championship in 2021, although those fitness problems have seen his morph into a centre-back more recently.",
      "In Amorim's system, a lot is demanded of the wing-backs and Shaw will be asked to cover more ground playing there than he would as a centre-back. It would be a more substantial test of whether he has truly overcome his injury problems.",
      "Speaking in November, Amorim left the door open for Shaw to play there. It's something of a problem position for United, with neither Diogo Dalot nor Patrick Dorgu really convincing there. Amorim will also lose Noussair Mazraoui and Amad as wing-back options from mid-December when they travel to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "“Yes, he can play there. It is the load that the player does in that position is different. Of course, he can play there; he’s a smart player and fit at the moment,\" said Amorim.",
      "With Martinez fit and the left-footed centre-back, Shaw could be tried at wing-back. That would allow Dalot to play on the right and would leave Dorgu and Tyrell Malacia in reserve.",
      "It's an approach Amorim could consider over the next month or so. The way Shaw has been playing, he will want to keep him in his team, even if Martinez returns to his best.",

      "There have been bumps along the way - the defeats to Grimsby Town, Manchester City and Everton were particularly shocking - but United are in a strong position as they head into the winter.",
      "Crystal Palace felt like a must-win game given the context of the last few weeks. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and then lost to Everton in a lifeless display, so they could not afford to end the month with a defeat at Selhurst Park.",
      "United welcome struggling West Ham to Old Trafford on Thursday night, and the fixture is a superb opportunity to record back-to-back league wins for just the second time this season.",
      "The in-house target for this campaign was to secure a spot in European football. Club sources deliberately did not specify the Champions League, but United must be aiming to return to that competition.",
      "That means winning back-to-back games regularly throughout the campaign. West Ham have won just once on the road this term, and United can't squander such a presentable opportunity.",
      "Matheus Cunha is expected to return to the squad to face West Ham. Cunha suffered a 'minor injury' in training last month, but it was serious enough to keep him out against Everton and Crystal Palace.",
      "Cunha's absence was a blow and the presumption is that he will return to the starting team upon his return, although that would mean one of the goalscorers from last weekend would lose their place.",
      "Amorim stuck by Joshua Zirkzee when most would have dropped him to face Palace. Zirkzee didn't offer much against Everton, but he was given another chance to show what he can do.",
      "That looked like a bad decision in the first half. Zirkzee followed every good touch with a loose touch and wasn't a goal threat, but he popped up quickly following the interval to score a superb goal.",
      "Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, yet he found the net like a prolific forward, brilliantly taking the ball down and lashing a volley beyond Dean Henderson, who was guarding the front post.",
      "The finish was so good that it was almost as if a Zirkzee doppelgänger had come out to play the second half. The Dutchman has not been associated with such goals during his up and down time in Manchester.",
      "\"It was really important,\" said Amorim of Zirkzee's goal. \"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half he struggled on the duels and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"We improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. That is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We play better because Josh played better in the second half.\"",
      "Mason Mount made his first start for United since playing against Liverpool at Anfield, and the midfielder delivered another strong performance, working tirelessly and scoring to make it 2-1.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Mount and Zirkzee were the attacking trio and Amorim will have to decide who to drop between the Palace goalscorers if he wants to bring Cunha back into the side.",
      "It's not out of the question that Cunha starts on the bench. He was named on the bench against Chelsea in September after returning from an injury, and Amorim could ease him back into action again.",
      "However, Cunha returned from a muscle injury on that occasion, whereas the reason for his recent absence has been said to be due to a training ground accident, which shouldn't be as serious as a muscle issue.",
      "It will be a tough decision between Mount and Zirkzee if Cunha is immediately recalled. The Dutchman is the favourite to lose his place, but his second-half performance against Palace was impressive, and there is a train of thought that a forward shouldn't lose their place after scoring.",
      "Nonetheless, it's a welcome attacking headache for Amorim ahead of the West Ham game.",

      "It may have been freezing conditions near the away dressing room at Selhurst Park at full time, but the jovial mood among the Manchester United squad was keeping spirits warm. Captain Bruno Fernandes joked with Joshua Zirkzee to pull his trousers up while a beaming Luke Shaw spoke at length with veteran commentator Martin Tyler before heading to the team bus.",
      "Ruben Amorim was keen to continue the positive atmosphere as he took one look at the assembled cast of journalists waiting in the mixed zone and teased doing a preliminary press conference before the main event. In the end, he made his apologies and ran up the stairs to the Media Centre.",
      "Match winner Mason Mount's positivity was obvious as he strolled up to the journalists, joking that we were blocking him from exiting. When the laughter subsided, Mount took us into the conversation between himself and Fernandes shortly before the winner.",
      "He explained: \"We always have a little conversation. I said to him: 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said: 'You stay there,' and then I said: 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it...He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption and then hit the target.\"",
      "Sunday was the first time Mount has completed 90 minutes in the league since he was at Chelsea, coincidentally against the same opposition as this weekend. \"It felt like a long time,\" Mount laughed when asked about playing the full game.",
      "\"It is obviously a massive positive for me as well. I have been working hard recently, I feel really good now so to get that 90 minutes under my belt is really positive, it is all about recovery now and going towards the next game.\"",
      "At half-time it felt as though such a light-hearted conversation with Mount was not going to take place. United were poor in the opening 45 minutes and were deservedly behind at the break thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's re-taken penalty.",
      "While United fans may have been panicking, this was not the case for Amorim in the dressing room. Mount said: \"He was saying to keep going, stay calm do what we needed to do. We all knew what to do in that second half.",
      "\"They have just played recently so we felt they could drop off in that second half, there was chances there for us so just carry on what we are doing. Obviously difficult to go down 1-0 but we showed character to get back into the game in the second half.\"",
      "While not the perfect performance, the result is all that matters at this stage for the Reds. They are now back within touching distance of the top four and Mount was clear his desire is now to push on.",
      "He said: \"I have had niggles but nothing bad at all [this season]. I have felt good this season, I had a good pre-season under my belt, I have been working hard in training every week, not just me, but as a group we have been at it, it's up and down but we are in a lot better place me personally and a group.",
      "\"We need to kick on now, win more games and the most important thing is to win, difficult result in the last game but to come back today was massively important. So yeah it is time to kick on now and shoot for those top four positions.\"",

Ruben Amorim stated last week that he expects to have the Brazil international back to face West Ham United this Thursday and with Cunha back on the grass, he looks set to be available.",
      "Amorim had confirmed as such in a recent press conference when asked about a potential return date for Cunha. He said: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Amorim will almost certainly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad and its fair to say the man himself is also very pleased. Via Instagram stories, with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he said: \"Back back back.\"",

      "He has since suffered a fresh blow with the decision made and now confirmed via the Cameroon FA's Instagram that he will not be representing his country at AFCON throughout December and potentially January. Instead, Simon Omossola, Devis Epassy, Simon Ngapandouetnbu and Edouard Sombang will be the 'keepers heading to the tournament.",

      "\"The only snag is that Evangelos Marinakis’ demands are far higher than City’s valuations so far, and they have refused to offer Nottingham Forest the £100 million. Whatever happens, Anderson will remain in Nottingham in January. His departure is only conceivable after the 2026 World Cup.",
      "\"Considered the future pillar of the Three Lions, Elliot Anderson has already informed his professional circle that he is giving priority to Manchester City for a future transfer.\"",
      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing up one of Brazil's most promising defenders, 17-year-old Luis Eduardo.",
      "Spanish publication AS has reported that the Brazilian captain's impressive speed has put clubs, including Manchester United, on high alert. The report suggests that Eduardo reached speeds of 38 km/h playing for Gremio U20 earlier this year.",
      "Over the summer, the centre-back signed a new contract with Gremio that runs until 2028. As part of this deal, a £53million release clause was included, and it remains unclear whether United would be willing to meet this fee.",
      "Barcelona chief Deco has spoken highly of Marcus Rashford after his loan spell in Catalonia.",
      "In an interview with The Times, he said:",

      "\"Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United — United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world — too young.",

      "“He’s gone away, knuckled down and become an absolute superstar for Napoli and for Scotland.",
      "“But I think Man United have learned from the mistake of letting him go, and they’re going to take a different approach towards Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“There’s been a lot of talk about his future, will he stay, will he go, will the manager give him more minutes or is he going to stay on the fringes?",
      "“As far as the club are concerned, there are no plans to let him go, because they know if he left it would be the same situation we’ve seen with McTominay.",
      "“He would go and impress wherever he went, and all of a sudden everybody would be asking why he wasn’t allowed to do that at Man United.",
      "“So if those offers do come in for him, I’d be very surprised if they allowed him to leave, and I still think he’s a huge part of their plans for the future.”"

      "Barcelona’s decision over whether to sign Marcus Rashford permanently is reportedly not as simple as it may seem, with opinions inside the club split. The Spanish giants have an option in Rashford’s loan deal allowing them to sign the Englishman permanently in the coming summer for £26m.",
      "Aston Villa had the same option - albeit at a higher price of £40m - when the Manchester-born forward spent the second half of last season on loan under Unai Emery. Despite Rashford impressing at Villa Park, they ultimately chose not to activate it – and Barcelona could end up making a similar decision.",
      "The 28-year-old looks to have settled quickly in Spain’s second city. Across his first 18 games for the club in all competitions, Rashford has scored six goals and registered seven assists.",
      "Signs had pointed towards Barca triggering the buy option. However, the La Liga champions have now identified a concern, one of the very same issues that pushed Manchester United towards moving Rashford out of their squad.",
      "According to Spanish outlet Sport, there are worries inside the club about Rashford’s high salary. The England international took a 25% pay cut and now earns around £240k per week. During the loan, Barca are covering the entirety of his wages.",
      "The Spanish club are also unsure about Rashford’s tactical adaptation. The United loanee is said to offer little in terms of high pressing, something which is a non-negotiable in any Hansi Flick team.",
      "The report adds that Barcelona’s priority is finding cover for Raphinha. United will hope a decision on Rashford’s future will be made soon.",
      "If he returns to United, he would likely be sent out on loan again or sold, with Ruben Amorim not viewing him as part of his long-term plans.",
      "Back in September, Flick spoke glowingly of Rashford. He said: “You have to look back a little. I’ve followed Marcus since Manchester United — he has speed, one-on-one skills and finishing.",
      "“What I’ve seen in the first few weeks has been very good, and he has some more potential to show. It’s great to have him on the team. He’s an incredible, fantastic player. What I’m seeing is very good.”",
      "Flick also previously told reporters: “I told Deco this summer: ‘Please get me a player like Marcus Rashford!’ I’m very happy to have him here. Rashford was an opportunity in the transfer market and we had to take it. I’m glad we did.",
      "“I spoke to him and said: ‘I need you in my team.’ This is a good step for Rashford. It will give him a lot of confidence.”",
      "But despite Flick’s admiration, Barcelona do not have unlimited funds. In fact, the opposite has been true in recent seasons, with the club repeatedly fighting to balance their finances.",
      "Rashford’s Barcelona stint has helped him return to Thomas Tuchel’s England squad, and the 28-year-old appears on the right path for next year’s World Cup. But even Tuchel has insisted more is needed.",
      "The England boss said: “The numbers don’t reach the potential. He needs to push himself with goal involvements. He knows that from me. I think he still has to make these decisions. He is still young enough to make these decisions, because otherwise he might be disappointed in 10 years with what he could have been and what he may have done.”",

      "When Brighton visited Manchester United in October, Danny Welbeck returned to Old Trafford as one of the most in-form strikers in the Premier League, having scored four goals in his last three games.",
      "United won 4-2, but the end of the game was unnecessarily nervy after a late surge from Brighton, who sensed an opportunity to get back into the contest after a free-kick from Welbeck.",
      "It was the eighth goal of Welbeck's career against his former club, and it's almost certain a few will have murmured \"we should never have sold him\" from the terraces. Welbeck departed in 2014, and he's scored goals at a steady rate throughout his career in an era in which United have spent a total of £310million on strikers.",
      "Arsenal signed Welbeck from United for £16million. Radamel Falcao had arrived on loan that summer, Wayne Rooney was 29, Robin van Persie was 31, and Javier Hernandez was 27.",
      "It didn't feel like a mistake to sell Welbeck at the time, but with the benefit of hindsight, most now believe he should have been kept, including former United assistant Rene Meulensteen.",
      "\"He didn't have the instincts of the strikers who live and die for scoring goals. Danny was obviously happy to score goals, but over time, he has improved that side of his game.",
      "\"When he was still young and coming through the ranks, he was tactically very gifted because we came through the academy skill programme that I put in place, and he fared so well with that",
      "\"He's a tall, strong boy, but he's got fantastic feet and a great brain, so he's a fantastic link striker, bringing others into play. He's got clever flicks in his locker to bring others into play. He's got a change of pace. And you look at his career and the various goals he has scored for all his clubs, it's impressive.\"",
      "Meulensteen continued: \"Like you said, he's been very steady, and he's got longevity. He's 34 now and, to be fairly honest, if you see his longevity and think how the Premier League has improved, let's say in the last 10 years, to be able to constantly perform as he has, that's been remarkable.",
      "\"But in some ways, not a surprise because Danny is a top player. He's got great intelligence and has looked after himself really well. Every time there are games, I always look forward to watching him.",
      "\"What I've always liked about Danny, he always plays with a smile on his face. He's been a huge credit to every club he's played for and like I said, Brighton should be delighted to have him.\"",
      "Discussing how Welbeck was regarded in the academy, Meulensteen said: \"I think everyone could see he was a very promising player and a very nice boy. Danny didn't try to be the centre of attention.",
      "\"He was gentle and a lovely kid. He had enormous potential. In terms of in training, I would say Danny, if you look at Ruud Van Nistelrooy, look at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and all the other great strikers that we have had, finishing is one of the elements of their game that you need to work on.",
      "\"He would love to score a goal, but he wasn't a natural goalscorer. When Ruud scored once, he would be dying to score a second, and if he managed that, he would kill to score his hat-trick.\"",
      "Van Nisterlooy was one of the most instinctive finishers the Premier League has ever seen, but can that be taught? \"You teach it at an early age to get the technique right,\" Meulensteen explained.",
      "\"But the next thing is giving the players the understanding because there is a variety within finishing. How do you place the shot? How do you lace it from outside the box? Or how do you hit a volley?",
      "\"There are so many different techniques. And the technique has to be taught early on, and then it has to be perfected in training. The next step for strikers is having the intelligence to understand where they are in front of the goal in relation to the goalkeeper and defenders.",
      "\"All that can be improved. The more you practice, the better you get, because that is the secret to all good finishers, but for us as coaches, it was down to us to come up with these challenging drills that the players could improve by doing.",
      "\"I always wanted to get the strikers to a point where they felt all the goals they had to score on a matchday, they had already scored during a training session. Because if that happens during a game, it's second instinct, and you can just grab it from your hard drive. You already know what to do.\"",
      "So, should United have kept Welbeck? \"Yes, 100 per cent,\" Meulensteen responded. \"He was under Van Gaal when he left, and if you look at the way he wanted to play football, which was possession-based, but in my opinion too slow, then Danny would have been the perfect guy for that.",
      "\"He could have played through the lines, linked up with the play and joined in. I felt that it was a shame, especially for a player with Manchester United DNA, that he was let go so easily.\"",
      "The importance of having players from the academy who understand what it means to represent United has been a talking point over the last 18 months, with Scott McTominay leaving to join Napoli, and Kobbie Mainoo looking likely to request to leave the club on loan in the January transfer window.",
      "Meulensteen said: \"It's very important, but we've moved too far away already because when United were still under the control of Sir Alex Ferguson, he made sure there was a block stream of young talent coming through. He understood that was the DNA of the club, the culture and identity.",
      "\"If you look at what United have lost since then, it's exactly that. They've lost that culture, the DNA and what the club was. They are still a big brand and a big club, which will never go away, but in terms of the identity of what United stood for when they were playing, that was important.",
      "\"It wasn't easy for young players like Danny Welbeck to come into the fold and find their place amongst players like Paul Scholes, Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and all of them.",
      "\"The needle has moved so much now, and the position of Man United has changed so much, that the players who are coming through in the academy don't necessarily have the capabilities and mental abilities to step in straight away and be consistent. And then there have been so many different influences from different managers. United have another now with Amorim, who is set in his ways.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo isn't getting a look in, Scott McTominay was sold. If you look at the most recent example of a player being sold with United DNA, that was McTominay. He wasn't a Carrick or a Scholes, but he had his own value to the club because he had the United blood running in his veins.\"",
      "Welbeck left United over a decade ago, but perhaps a lesson should be learned from his departure.",

Mateta and Yoro tangled before the break in the penalty area, with the attacker making no mistake to give Palace the lead from 12 yards.",

      "As Manchester United applauded the away section at Selhurst Park, Leny Yoro walked with his hood up. Yoro was visibly disappointed with his performance and Mason Mount put an arm around him.",
      "Mount spoke a few words of encouragement to Yoro and patted him as if to say 'don't worry about it'. The defender was brought off in the 54th minute and TV cameras showed him crestfallen on the bench.",
      "Yoro appears to be his own harshest critic. He was aware his performance against Crystal Palace was poor and seemed to be beating himself up, even after the three points were secured.",
      "United now have one choice with Yoro: support him and take him out of the firing line to help restore his confidence. He only celebrated his 20th birthday last month, and every young player is bound to have challenging moments, but what truly matters is how one reacts to adversity.",
      "Yoro's display wasn't a complete surprise after his showing against Everton last Monday, as he'd been one of the culprits in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal at Old Trafford.",
      "The warning signs were there in Croydon. Matthijs de Ligt and Yoro got their wires crossed, which led to a sitter for Jean-Philippe Mateta, but Yoro redeemed himself with a superb block to deny Yeremy Pino.",
      "That was until Yoro made a clumsy challenge to concede a penalty. It was the type of tackle made by a player struggling with confidence. Yoro was not in a position to yield a clean challenge and he still attempted to win the ball, which inevitably meant Mateta was fouled in the penalty area.",
      "Yoro probably wouldn't have tried to make that challenge if he were in a better vein of form. He was aware he wasn't playing at his best and was desperate to try to make a difference, which led to a bad decision.",
      "The consensus in the press box during the interval as United trailed 1-0 was they had little chance of winning after an awful 45 minutes, but they reacted in a much-improved second half.",
      "Johsua Zirkzee and Mount scored brilliant goals to wrap up a victory, condemning Palace to a first defeat at Selhurst Park in the Premier League for nine months. Palace grew weary due to their Thursday night exploits, but that should not take away from United's reaction after a dismal first half.",
      "Mount should be lauded for exchanging a few thoughtful words with Yoro after the final whistle. The midfielder comes across as genuine when he speaks to journalists in the mixed zone, and made sure to comfort Yoro when he could have just lapped up the adulation for his goal.",
      "When Yoro recently spoke to reporters at Carrington, he spoke about strong bonds in the dressing room after the decision from Amorim to axe a handful of players in the summer window.",
      "\"This is just one group of friends. This is the best for the team,\" said Yoro. His teammates will support him after Palace and remind him that peaks and troughs are all part of the journey as a player.",
      "Rio Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"This game can send you crazy at times… Use these learnings as fuel. He’s a young player and will bounce back. It's a new day tomorrow.\"",
      "Yoro suffered a bad week and will become a better player for it, because making mistakes is the only way to learn. Amorim was right to bring him off early in the second half, and it's logical to remove him from the spotlight against West Ham on Thursday night to protect his confidence.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made his first appearance since picking up an anterior cruciate ligament injury at the beginning of February and could replace Yoro in the starting team, while Noussair Mazraoui is also an option, along with Ayden Heaven, so there is no need to start Yoro against West Ham.",
      "Giving Yoro a breather after two disappointing performances will do him the world of good. It would be common-sense management of a player who is still young and developing aspects of his game.",
      "There will be a time when Yoro is held to a higher standard, but he wouldn't have been human if he hadn't had a few off days along the way to reaching his full potential. He will come back stronger after Selhurst Park.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has shown his true colours insisting winning with Napoli is more important than finding the back of the net himself and ending his goal drought. The Manchester United striker is currently on loan with the Serie A side ahead of a permanent move to the Italian club next summer.",
      "The striker, who 95 appearances for United after signing from Atalanta in August 2023, scored 26 goals during his time at Old Trafford, but struggled for consistency. Ruben Amorim's side agreed a £38.8 million deal with Antonio Conte's outfit that would see Hojlund complete a permanent transfer after his loan if the Italian club qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Napoli finished last season as champions of Serie A and are looking to retain their crown this season. They currently sit second in the table behind AC Milan on goal difference.",
      "However, despite a bright start to life in Naples, Hojlund has scored just four goals in 13 games in all competitions, setting up a further two goals for his teammates.",
      "The 22-year-old scored a brace against Sporting in the Champions League back in October, but has not scored in the Italian top flight since a goal against Genoa in the same month.",
      "That being said, Hojlund has registered back-to-back assists in his last two outings against Atalanta and AS Roma, helping his side gain an important six points in the title race.",
      "Speaking to DAZN after setting up the winner against Roma, Hojlund said: \"Obviously, I'd like to score a lot of goals again and start doing so soon, but it's important to always contribute to the team, and I'm happy to help.",
      "\"I try my best to be useful. I consider myself a - myself a team player: winning is more important than scoring goals.\"",
      "Few could question Hojlund's desire during his time at Old Trafford but his lack of goals meant United had to be proactive in the transfer market this summer. Amorim's side signed Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo in an attempt to improve their fortunes and so far, United are in the race for European football.",
      "Hojlund had been reluctant to leave United and wanted to fight for his place, but did eventually return to Italy, citing Conte as a key figure in the move.",
      "\"Conte is a top coach,\" he said. \"I came here because I knew this was an important step for me. Napoli is a great club and a wonderful place to live. It's exactly what I need right now in my career.\"",
      "Conte had also waxed lyrical about the young striker back in October after scoring against Genoa. He said: \"He's a 22-year-old who was on the sidelines at Manchester United.",
      "\"He has significant room for improvement, he needs to work because he has the potential to become a star, and he's proving it.\"",

      "Manchester United have returned to winning ways as they came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1.",
      "United were second best in the first half and went behind with ten minutes remaining as Jean-Philippe Mateta was clumsily brought down by Leny Yoro. After VAR ordered a retake due to a double touch, the striker scored from the spot.",
      "But after the break United made their fresher legs count. They equalised from nothing as Bruno Fernandes’ free kick picked out Joshua Zirkzee who composed himself before firing in.",
      "Moments later the game was turned on its head. Fernandes laid off a free kick for Mason Mount to fire home through a crowd and the Reds did well to hold on and claim a big three points on the road.",
      "Follow all the reaction and look back at the highlights below…",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog. This is the end of our coverage",
      "Amorim joked United have improved their set-piece record by \"stealing\" ideas from rivals in the Premier League, following a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from the spot in the 32nd minute. United were awful in the first half and the hosts thoroughly deserved their one-goal advantage at the interval.",
      "United looked like a different team when play resumed. Joshua Zirkzee equalised, firing his half-volley beyond Dean Henderson, and Mason Mount made it 2-1 from another set-piece routine.",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "\"Great feeling, it’s always a good feeling but most importantly just got us back into the game and this guy [Mount] scored a pretty good goal after. It was all about three points today, just very happy we got them.",
      "\"It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and you have to perform so if you don’t score for a long time it can get to you but I’m surrounded by great players, great people and we help each other every day.",
      "\"So they made it quite easy for me and today is just a reward I think for patience, hard work, trying to be consistent and I’m just thankful to them.\"",
      "\"We’ve not found it easy away from home this season, obviously a very difficult result in the last game so we knew we needed to bounce back.",
      "\"That’s what we spoke about before the game, I thought we showed good character to come back after the 1-0 down first half so it was about reacting in the changing room. Second half, and I thought we did that really good. We came out and we were at it.",
      "\"I’m feeling good, the win obviously was massive but also for me to play the full game, I can’t remember, I haven’t done that in a while. I’ve been feeling really good recently, no problems, I’m enjoying my football and when you have days like this in front of fans like this it makes it all worth it.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim hurried to the Selhurst Park dressing room at half-time. Manchester United were trailing 1-0 after an awful first half. Whatever Amorim said to the players worked when play resumed.",
      "The good work of October was in danger of being undone by an awful November, but United clawed their way back into the game, winning the battle of endurance against a tired Crystal Palace. The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "Read the full report here >>>",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Made a few saves you would expect him to make in the first half, but he was the pick of a bad bunch in the opening 45 minutes. 6",

      "Had another bad game. Yoro got away with a blunder when Mateta failed to finish and appeared to redeem himself with an important block, but he made a clumsy challenge to concede the penalty. 3",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Mateta is an old-school centre-forward and asked questions of De Ligt from the first whistle, winning the physical battle and pulling him out of position. Looked more comfortable in the second half. 5",
      "Read the ratings here>>>",
      "That's it, United hold on for a big three points. Zirkzee and Mount with the goals in the second half win it.",

      "Wharton, Pino OFF",
      "Hughes, Uche ON",
      "Zirkzee and Mbeumo nearly trip each other up, eventually the latter has a go but it is easily saved. United will hope these misses don't come back to haunt them.",

      "Mazraoui rolls Guehi and is brought down by the Palace man, booking given and now a dangerous free kick to come.",
      "Shaw is booked for a foul but United aren't happy. Dalot looked to be fouled at the other end of the pitch by Richards moments before.",
      "Deep ball into the area is flicked on by Nketiah but the ball drops wide.",
      "De Ligt clatters Mateta as they go for the ball and the free kick is given.",

      "GOAL UNITED. Mason Mount. Fernandes over a free kick after Dalot was fouled. He steps up and lays it off for Mount to fire in!",
      "Mateta gets some luck and charges towards goal but he fires it over the bar",
      "This is where United's fresh legs could count. Palace feeling the effects of midweek and the Reds look the better team. If they can grab another, it would be impressive.",
      "Mazraoui clears the ball, it hits Zirkzee and goes just behind for a corner",

The season is a marathon and it was crucial United stopped the rot, and they did in Croydon after a concerning first half.",
      "United had won just one of their last 11 Premier League away games - against Liverpool at Anfield last month. Speaking during the pre-match press conference, Amorim admitted he didn't know why his team struggles on the road, but he said that his players need to learn how to \"finish games\".",
      "Amorim axed Patrick Dorgu from his starting line-up following his admission that he senses \"anxiety\" from the defender when he's on the ball. Diogo Dalot came into the team, but the Portugal international has also been unconvincing at left wing-back this season.",
      "Shea Lacey, 18, was the only attacking option on the bench. Kobbie Mainoo has played as a No.10 in Amorim's system, but the United boss has confirmed he views him as a deep midfielder. Only Arsenal (six) had conceded fewer goals than Palace (nine) in the Premier League this season, and United had been hopeless in the final third against Everton earlier in the week.",
      "But United still had no excuse not to pose a threat on Sunday. Palace were in European action against Strasbourg in France on Thursday, meaning they had just two days to prepare, compared to United's five days of preparation at Carrington, so the Reds rocked up to Selhurst Park with an immediate advantage.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo gave Amad a pat on the back as the players returned to the dressing room to prepare for kick-off. Amad assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and it felt like their relationship could be key again. As it turned out, United managed to claim a win despite the pair not being at their best.",
      "Dalot contributed more in the first 30 seconds than Dorgu had in 58 minutes against Everton, launching a long throw-in into the box, which Casemiro remarkably did not find the net from.",
      "The away section belted out '12 Days of Cantona' for two obvious reasons: December is now just around the corner and United were playing at the scene of the infamous kung fu kick.",
      "Amorim looked frustrated as Palace began to carve out opportunities. He paced up and down the touchline and was reminded by the fourth official to stay within his area. Then Mbeumo was shown a yellow card for throwing the ball to the ground, clearly frustrated at how the game was unfolding.",
      "Adam Wharton sent a shot straight at Senne Lammens from the edge of the box, Jean-Philippe Mateta missed a sitter after a mistake from Yoro, and Yeremy Pino was stunned to see his effort blocked by Yoro in a later move. Yoro managed to redeem himself for his blunder leading to Mateta's chance.",
      "Mateta continued to ask questions. He bullied Matthijs de Ligt and drew another mistake from Yoro, who needlessly fouled him in the box from a position that was never going to yield a clean challenge.",
      "The penalty was converted - but there was a double touch and VAR ordered it to be retaken. That rule needs to change because the opponent should not be given another bite at the cherry after botching the first penalty. Nonetheless, Mateta scored his second penalty.",
      "\"Boom, boom, boom, boom, Mateta's in the room\" was chanted twice to the tune of the Vengaboys hit. The double embarrassment should have sparked a response, but the white shirts limped into the interval. Amad and Mbeumo were not at the races, and United do not tend to fire when the pair underperform.",
      "Luke Shaw shook his head as the whistle went for half-time. Shaw has been at United for 11 years and was making just his 300th appearance for the club. The defender has played for five permanent managers during his time at Old Trafford and might have been close to playing for another if the Reds had not completed a comeback. There will not be another inquest come on Monday morning.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both had the desired effect. Dalot had a great game and Mason Mount finished brilliantly to fire United into a 2-1 lead. It was a brave decision from Amorim to stick with Joshua Zirkzee, but even that call was vindicated by the Dutchman's well-taken half-volley to equalise.",
      "Zirkzee's shot had to be powerful to beat Dean Henderson - and it was. Zirkzee has not looked like a striker since his arrival from Bologna, but he will be alright if he can score more goals like that for United.",
      "The Everton performance was shocking and Amorim needed to produce an answer. He did.",

      "\"I think you are used to seeing that, but when you come for the Premier League you learn a lot with other teams how to do it and we are stealing a lot of things to score goals. \"",
      "Amorim discussed what he said to the players at half-time, saying: \"It's just to understand for everyone to understand the game. I felt in the last ten minutes of the first half, I felt that the opponent was struggling and they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling that we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"And it was that, of course. We tried to change little things in the game. But the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh in our connection, was better and that improves a lot the way we play.\"",
      "When asked whether he believed United could turn the game around, he said: \"I felt that because I had the feeling that if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box and you can feel it the way they move.",
      "\"They were getting tired for the second half and we talked about that. And again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League. So we increased that and I had the feeling that if we score one goal this is going to change completely.",
      "\"I really like also the way we controlled the game with the ball, winning the game. So we were in front but we were not afraid of trying to score the next one and to control the ball in their half.\"",
      "Amorim believes the lack of intensity in the first half was due to 'small details'. \"Sometimes it's a lot of things,\" he added. \"Sometimes you don't need to move but the pace of the ball can be better.",
      "\"You need to understand that Mateta was the man that had the time to think and if you see in the second half, sometimes it was him that starts the play. All these small details I think we improved. And when you have one play, two plays, the rhythm flows better and you increase everything mentally and physically.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has opened up about the shock he felt upon learning of his dismissal as Manchester United manager.",
      "The ex-United boss took over the reins at Old Trafford in December 2018, stepping in after Jose Mourinho's departure. He was then awarded the permanent role in March 2019, following a string of successful results - a position he held until his sacking in November 2021.",
      "Solskjaer, who had an 11-year stint as a player at United, presided over a summer of significant expenditure in his last transfer window, which saw Cristiano Ronaldo make a sensational return to Manchester.",
      "The £72million signing of Jadon Sancho stirred excitement among fans, while Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane was brought in after a decade in Spain. United kicked off the 2021/22 season on a high note, securing victories in four of their first five Premier League matches.",
      "However, things started to unravel for Solskjaer as United suffered five losses in their subsequent seven games, leaving them languishing in seventh place. A crushing 4-1 defeat to Watford proved to be the final straw for the Norwegian, with his dismissal announced the next day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reflecting on his unceremonious exit from Manchester four years later, Solskjaer told the BBC that while his departure was justified, it did little to ease the disappointment he experienced when he was informed of his termination.",
      "Speaking to Kelly Somers, the 52-year-old reflected on his tenure at Old Trafford: \"That pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was [by] having great staff around us.",
      "\"[The] environment in and around the club was very positive. But in the end, it doesn't matter if you enjoy coming to work everyday, you need results. We unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man United and they made a change, which is fine.",
      "\"It was sad, we lost to Watford of course and I knew this was more or less the end. [I] drove my family to the airport, they went back to Norway actually and I was going to work. I got a text, 'Ole, I need to see you in my office', and I knew what was going to happen so I rang my wife straight away.",
      "\"'I'll be back, I'll catch you up', I said. I think it's sudden but not surprising. If you don't get results, you do make a change in football but I felt we had something going.\"",
      "Accepting the United position represents an intimidating challenge at any point, particularly for someone like Solskjaer who had never managed in England's top division before taking the role.",
      "However, even for the most experienced managers, the position proved overwhelmingly demanding, the Norwegian admitted. During the BBC interview, he revealed that then-Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti confided during a match between the sides that he wouldn't fancy the United job.",
      "Boasting a CV that includes Juventus, AC Milan, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, the Italian's statement was quite significant. Solskjaer recalled: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.' And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure.",
      "\"That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim praised Joshua Zirkzee and Diogo Dalot following Manchester United's 2-1 comeback victory against Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Zirkzee brought United level at the start of the second half with a well-taken half-volley. Then Mason Mount fired United into the lead, finding the bottom corner from a set-piece routine.",
      "Amorim stuck by Zirkzee after a disappointing performance against Everton, and he made the decision to recall Dalot to the starting team after moving him to the bench on Monday night. Both Zirkzee and Dalot were praised during Amorim's post-match press conference.",
      "\"It was really important,\" said Amorim of Zirkzee's goal. \"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half he struggled on the duels and he won some duels in the second half. We improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. That is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We play better because Josh played better in the second half.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo drifted closer to Zirkzee in the second half. \"I didn't say 'go near Josh',\" Amorim said. \"I just said to the players we need to be more alive and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often. I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired also in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers right away a goal, you felt that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Amorim was critical of his options at left wing-back at his pre-match press conference on Friday, and admitted he was pleased with the response from Dalot at Selhurst Park. When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick.",
      "\"I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",

      "Barcelona's sporting director Deco has suggested Marcus Rashford was burdened with excessive responsibility \"too young\" - which ultimately contributed to his difficulties at Manchester United.",
      "The 28-year-old, currently on loan with the Catalan club, emerged as a teenage sensation a decade ago but has struggled to consistently perform season-on-season at Old Trafford, leaving his long-term future uncertain. He made his breakthrough under Louis van Gaal in 2016 - netting twice on his European debut.",
      "Rashford's reputation soared rapidly, yet he has already served under five permanent bosses in Manchester and, from an early age, was viewed as one of the squad's key figures. He frequently found himself amongst the first to face criticism when the team underperformed.",
      "Ruben Amorim seemed to question Rashford's commitment and he is now on his second temporary move away from Manchester, with Deco arguing he has been compelled to shoulder too much responsibility whilst the persistent instability has created problems.",
      "He told The Times: \"He's happy with us. Marcus is a fantastic player. He faced the responsibility of becoming an important player at Man United - United, like us, are one of the biggest clubs in the world - too young.",
      "\"He suffered a bit with this change of generation at United too. If you see United in the last five years, they had difficulties rebuilding the team, to become stronger again.",
      "\"He was there. So it's not easy for a player [from whom] people demand a lot. When you are an important player, you have a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"We were looking for a player like him on the market. A player that could play in the three positions up front.",
      "\"We were able to sign Marcus on loan now because of his desire to play for Barcelona. He waited a lot. He knew that we were dealing with financial rules. But he was patient. He waited and we're happy to have him.\"",
      "It's yet to be determined whether Rashford's move to Barcelona will become a permanent one, although there is an option in his loan agreement. Despite a wealth of talent in Catalunya, Rashford has still proved a valuable addition, scoring an impressive double on his return to England against Newcastle earlier this season.",
      "The United loanee has found the back of the net six times during his loan spell and appears to have regained his form. With his childhood club, he has experienced significant highs, including a season where he reached the 30-goal mark, but has also faced harsh criticism when things haven't gone as expected.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu has thanked the Manchester United fans for their support, after the Reds returned to winning ways against Crystal Palace on Sunday afternoon. Ruben Amorim's side came from behind to record a much-needed 2-1 victory at Selhurst Park.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta put Palace ahead in the first half, but United responded after the break to turn the game on on its head. Joshua Zirkzee levelled in the 54th minute with a smart finish before Mason Mount scored the winner just past the hour mark.",
      "Speaking after United's win in south London, Dorgu took to Instagram to send a message to the supporters. Alongside an image of him in action, the left-back said: \"Always thankful for the support [red love heart emoji].\"",
      "After starting Monday's 1-0 defeat at home to Everton, Dorgu dropped down to the bench for the trip to Palace. However, he still managed to get some game time, replacing Amad Diallo in stoppage-time.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Amorim decided to go for Diogo Dalot at left wing-back with Amad on the other side. Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw made up the back-three with Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Zirkzee up front.",
      "Amorim's decision came after comments he made in a press conference regarding Dorgu and the contrast in performances for his country, Denmark, and United.",
      "\"When I see them training they are doing so much better than in games,\" Amorim said. \"Then Patrick, when I see him playing for the national team, he’s scored a great goal against Scotland, the decision that he made under pressure was completely different to the decision('s) he’s making in our team.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. \"I can feel it, the anxiety.\"",
      "It was Bruno Fernandes who stole the show against Palace, assisting both Zirkzee and Mount as United recorded a first win since October. Casemiro started alongside him in midfield with Senne Lammens completing the XI in goal.",
      "Reflecting on his side's win, Amorim cut a relieved figure. When asked if he said anything at half-time to prompt a reaction from his United team, the Portuguese said: \"No, we just wanted everyone to understand the game.",
      "\"I felt in the last 10 minutes of the first half that the opponent was struggling, and that they would struggle in the second half. We had that feeling, and we needed to do something to change the way we were playing.",
      "\"We tried to change little things in the game - the intensity and the quality in the way we connect, especially Josh [Zirkzee] - he improved a lot the way we played.\"",
      "\"It was massive,\" Fernandes, meanwhile told MUTV, when asked how big the win was for United. \"We needed the three points after the performance and the result we had last week.",
      "\"We needed a response very quickly. I think first half was not great for us, but the second half was a very big response.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Individually, the stand-outs are starting to… stand out. Here, according to WhoScored ratings, is every club’s best player of the season so far…",
      "The third-best player in the league so far, Rice’s rating (7.30) is matched by Gabriel, but the England star edges it on account of having played more minutes. Rice is becoming the complete midfielder, even if the battle between him and Moises Caicedo was won by… Reece James.",
      "Villa had a rough summer but their best signing may have been the contract extension penned by Kamara in July. His first goal of the season, the winner against Wolves, was Villa’s ninth from outside the box, more than they have scored inside the area. Which feels… unsustainable.",
      "As one of the few defenders Bournemouth kept, we’re about to see how important the 28-year-old is since the Argentinian will sit out the clash with Everton due to suspension.He needed dropping anyway.",
      "The Premier League’s second-highest scorer with 11 goals in 13 games, Thiago’s exploits might be catching more attention if he wasn’t in Erling Haaland’s shade. Thiago, though, is matching Haaland for importance, both having scored 52 per cent of their team’s goals.",
      "Only Jeremy Doku and Mohammed Kudus have enjoyed more successful take-ons than the Liverpool-linked winger, with just Doku and Cody Gakpo recording a higher number for expected assists.",
      "It is handy the summer signing has been in good form since no goalkeeper has been busier than Dubravka, the Slovakian making more saves than any other keeper having faced the most shots on target.",
      "MORE: Who is the best Prem keeper this season? Vicario, Pickford plummet",
      "Chalobah has had to be patient while establishing himself as a Chelsea starter but the defender has the seventh-highest average rating in the league, with Gabriel the only centre-back higher on the list.",
      "The Colombian has scored two and assisted another couple while showing himself to be the kind of wing-back Manchester United could use. Which may be one of Munoz’s primary motivations.",
      "Losing Ndiaye, their top scorer, during AFCON is a big worry for Everton, with his performances said to have put him on Liverpool’s shortlist along with Kenan Yildiz, Rodrygo and Michael Olise.

      "The Premier League signing of the season and it’s not even close.",
      "It’s scary to think how bad Spurs would have been to watch without Kudus’s dribbling on the right flank.

      "“It’s sad, because I love Neymar. I thought a couple of years ago it’d have been a perfect move because he can still be an amazing player. He could really boost United with his inventiveness and talent.",
      "“I think perhaps the way he has had his career guided needed to be challenged in the past. I don’t know how he can set about putting things right and rebuilding anymore. United need players who will sacrifice themselves for the team, who are in love with the club. I’m not sure Neymar is the man to offer that to United at this point in his career.”",

If they don’t, they have to take the hit and miss out this winter. The market has not been the easiest one for many years. So they need to take their time, and not act just for the sake of it. They need real purpose in the transfer market.",

      "“They need to want to play for Man United more than anything, and this is what they have really done well in the summer. They signed players who really want to play, and don’t think about themselves only.",
      "“So there are elements of joy to see that they’re completely in line with the mission, and the challenge ahead. They’ve stopped looking at players who just see United as a stepping stone. That doesn’t work. I think if they find the right players, they can act, but they don’t need to add players just for the sake of it.”",
      "Neymar has been linked with a transfer to England, Major League Soccer and various other places and former USMNT star Brad Friedel has suggested he could link up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at Inter Miami.",
      "Friedel told Goal: “If Neymar is fit, then I think it works, I really do because he’s still a huge name in certain parts of the US. The trouble is if he’s not fit and he’s injured a lot, then it becomes a negative media-driven reality. I can understand arguments on both sides for sure.",
      "“I would assume, and these are smart guys, it would be a tiered contract based on performances and being fit. Having spent some time in Miami, before Messi came you wouldn’t have really known that Miami had a team. From the time that he came, there are pink and black shirts everywhere.

      "But that record is about to collide head on with the Busy Festive Period, the glorious month of December in which even titchy little clubs like United with no other competitions to worry about find themselves facing another game every three or four days and no real clue who they’ll be playing from one game to the next and then also playing the same team twice in the space of about a fortnight for some reason.",
      "Can Shaw really continue to be relied upon in every game? The extreme levels of weariness on display against the 10 men of Everton last week rather suggest not.",
      "",
      "Let’s be entirely fair about it; this one would have been far more valid a month ago than it is now. In a way, the sight of a previously struggling Gibbs-White scoring in three straight games should perhaps make us rethink this entire feature. Maybe they all just need more time. But we’re not doing that. We are not in the business of learning things here.",
      "None of the other players on this list have Gibbs-White’s mitigation, for one thing, of starting the season on the back of a deeply bizarre summer in which he thought he was joining Tottenham (lucky escape etc. and so forth ho ho ho) only to then sign a new contract announced in a video alongside Mr Marinakis that definitely wasn’t unsettling or strange at all.",
      "The recent goals have coincided with Forest’s recent resurgence under Sean Dyche, but they do still also mask to some extent a significant reduction in Gibbs-White’s role as this team’s creative spark. Having hit double figures for assists last season, he has just one to his name so far in this campaign.",

      "Perhaps the clearest indicator of the difference between Bournemouth last season and Bournemouth this season is the fact Senesi has already racked up more Premier League minutes in 25/26 (1158) than in the entirety of 24/25 (1107).",
      "He’s not been bad, per se, it’s just that as the one constant in a defence that has now shipped 12 goals in four winless games, it does start to draw attention. Feels like maybe it’s time to try something else.",
      "And Andoni Iraola has no choice now anyway; the defeat at Sunderland from 2-0 up was disastrous for many reasons, but disciplinary chaos was high on the list. For the second Premier League game in a row, Senesi picked up a booking in injury-time, taking him to the five-card suspension threshold which will see him join Lewis Cook and David Brooks on the naughty step for the midweek Everton game.",

      "So anonymous even in the impressive victory at Tottenham that Spurs fans didn’t even remember to boo him for being Arsenal. In fairness they were a bit preoccupied booing their own players, but they did still remember when Emile Smith Rowe came on. And Emile Smith Rowe has sadly become a byword for anonymous.",
      "Iwobi has started every single game for Fulham this season as he closes in on reaching the 100 Premier League appearances landmark for a third top-flight club, but hasn’t contributed either a goal or assist since the 3-1 win over Brentford in September, which is eight games ago now.",

      "Harsh and vindictive to single Joao Gomes out, but Wolves are at the stage where trying almost anything they haven’t already attempted feels like it doesn’t really have any significant downside. What’s the worst thing that can actually happen next to a team with two points from 13 games?",
      "Basically, nobody wants to be the player with the most minutes in a side that has lost 11 Premier League games before the advent calendars come out. You do start to look like a bit of an albatross, even if that’s not really very fair.",
      "Statistically, though, the evidence suggests that instead of dropping Gomes, Rob Edwards should actually make him captain. Wolves’ points per game rockets from 0.15 all the way up to 1.00 when Gomes has the armband. Although one game is admittedly a small sample size.",
      "",
      "And again. Is this particularly fair? No. But have Leeds lost six of their last seven Premier League games meaning that at this time only Wolves are less sh*t? Yes.",
      "So we’re once again in ‘can’t really make things worse’ territory. There are three contenders in the Leeds squad and our airily dismissive snap judgement is that Bogle has been less good than Joe Rodon and they’ve already tried leaving Gabriel Gudmundsson out in the Man City game, with, well, quite confusing results given he came on just after Leeds had somehow got that game back to 2-2.",
      "But that ultimately futile comeback after leaving out a previous ever-present surely only shows proof of concept for trying it again, doesn’t it? Against a team that maybe isn’t Man City? When you need a tenth name for a feature: yes, yes it does.",

Fair point but that undermines the “whole coaching them all week” point you made. What was he coaching them? Because it wasn’t urgency against a team that played in Europe on Thursday. We were the team who looked like we had played in midweek such was our apparent apathy and lack of urgency. Why do we need to sacrifice a whole half for the manager to get this team to do what he had a whole week to prepare for?",
      "Also if looking at your bench and choosing the only non-youth team player who can play striker because of an injury is management then I’m expecting a call up any day now. I will concede that the Mount pick was good but again those two goals came from two moments of individual genius from dead ball situations. Like I said up until the 76th-ish minute the only touch we had in the opposition box was Zirkzee’s goal.",

We were lucky not to be 3-0 down at half time with Mateta just squeezing one wide and that Palace shot from a long throw in that went straight at Lammens.",
      "Sorry mate. I really do want to celebrate a United win but this win had some SERIOUS caveats attached to it and we as United fans shouldn’t be happy with a band aid victory after that Everton defeat where Amorim REFUSED to change shape and left us with 5 at the back against ten men.",
      "Andreas Hasle makes some excellent points and I agree with almost his whole email. One thing I absolutely agree has to be changed in the PL and football in general is the after shot tackle as he mentions about Konsa. How a player is allowed to absolutely plough into an attacker and face no censure after the player has taken his shot is completely ridiculous. I don’t know why it’s allowed and honestly it’s ridiculous and dangerous. But I suppose asking for refereeing consistency and accountability is tilting at windmills in the extreme",

We’ll never know but psychologically I wonder if going straight to another hostile stadium and tough opponent was what changed the mentality from seeking comfort to sharpening focus.",
      "The Pope decision being taken out of Howe’s hands due to injury was helpful. Burn being trusted at CB showed us again that he is an outstanding defender in the right position, but that cannot be full back where Hall was excellent and brings so much to the attack that Burn cannot. Thiaw is just in that kind of form top CBs can get into – imperious in defence but in the right place in attack – peak Van Dijk, Dias & Gabriel have shown how much impact that kind of defender can have at both ends of the pitch, we have to keep him fit.",

I wasn’t reading too much into Tonali not playing as he needs a rest but if Bruno is left to do all the playmaking we’ve seen that doesn’t work, Miley helped balance that and Joelinton was very impressive in the 2nd half. Now we know we can rotate in midfield we need to see more of it.",
      "Woltemade’s finish was filthy, but like the City game he played better overall, had more chances and if anything looks more of a threat than those earlier games where he was scoring maybe from one chance. And Elanga gave what was comfortably his best performance. He should have done better with that first chance in the first few seconds of the game, but tactically he was very good and that was key to a very good team performance. Getting his first assist will help I’m sure.",
      "Only downside is how dependent we are on Hall and Livramento staying fit in order to play as we did against Everton and against City. Lovely when they are together but if either is out our other options at FB cannot offer the same mobility, drive and dynamism. We need another left back as Burn should not be the first choice back up.",
      "What I love about Howe is that he does change things. He might wait a bit too long and he seems reactive rather than proactive, but he will adapt. Contrast that with Amorim who won’t change a thing regardless of circumstances and I can only give my opinion that Howe will outlast Amorim as a top coach. I wrote in a couple of weeks ago saying this period will make or break the season and Howe’s reputation and I stand by that, but we’ve got a home match against a Spurs team who are at a very low ebb tomorrow, win that and its three league wins back-to-back, with another home game against Burnley at the weekend.\nJames, Leeds",

      "Names are put forward, but all pale in comparison to a man who’s who’s not good enough for PSG but is still very good (promise), as proven by him thriving at Sporting under a manager not yet attractive enough to unseat Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.",

      "In quite the catalogue of midfield recriminations at Manchester United, the summer of 2024 is a doozy. Pushing McTominay to Napoli for him to be named Serie A MVP while winning the Scudetto and signing Ugarte in his stead is extraordinarily poor judgement by their own extraordinarily low standards.",
      "Eventually PSG dropped their price for Ugarte to what was at the time thought to be a €50m bargain but has since proven to be a gross overpayment for a footballer who’s at best a midfield passenger rather than the fighter the United hierarchy were hoping for, and more often than not an ally to opposition teams in their routine bypassing of the Red Devils midfield.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has urged Kobbie Mainoo to be “razor sharp” for the Manchester United game time he won’t be handed by Ruben Amorim in the next few weeks.",
      "Mainoo has featured for just 261 minutes for United this season as he plays the most second of second fiddles to Bruno Fernandes in midfield. The captain’s position alongside a more typical defensive midfielder – Casemiro as thing stand – in the double pivot is the only role Amorim sees Mainoo playing in, and what we’ve seen in recent games suggests not even AFCON will offer the academy graduate the football he needs.",
      "The imminent departures of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo has been seen as Mainoo’s golden opportunity to play and stake a claim for a more permanent spot in Amorim’s starting XI, and Ferdinand still believes that to be the case.",
      "“If I’m Kobbie Mainoo now I’m probably sitting there for the last couple of weeks, I’m going to get myself razor sharp, majorly fit and ready for when the African Nations hits,” Ferdinand said on his podcast.",
      "“Because if I don’t get in the team, then what is going on?",
      "“The manager could easily, easily move Bruno even into the false nine if Sesko is not fit. He’s done that before. If Cunha is not fit as well, he can move Bruno to the left and play Kobbie in the midfield.",
      "“I think it’s a big, big few weeks for Kobbie Mainoo in determining how he feels about his role at the football club, how he feels about staying or going.",
      "“These next few weeks are going to be telling in that department. So watch this space.”",
      "There’s a whole lot of “ifs” in there and we’ve essentially seen a dry run for AFCON in the last two games. With two forwards – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – not available to play, Mainoo has still only played 32 minutes off the bench in the defeat to Everton, and came on in the last minute in the victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "With Cunha posting a picture of himself in training with the caption ‘back back back’ and Joshua Zirkzee coming up trumps in that win over Palace with a very fine finish, the nailed-on front three when Mbeumo and Amad depart will see Mason Mount and Cunha either side of Zirkzee, who may or may not drop out of the team when Sesko returns from injury in a couple of weeks’ time.",

      "Man Utd have made a record-breaking ‘offer’ to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new signings in the summer transfer market with priority given to improvements in attacking areas.",
      "After being the fifth lowest scorers in the Premier League last term, Man Utd brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to try and solve their goalscoring woes.",
      "But many Man Utd supporters and former players thought failing to sign a new midfielder in the summer was a massive mistake after their issues last term.",
      "The Red Devils did make enquiries for Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba but in the end nothing concrete came from those talks.",
      "And now reports in Spain indicate that Man Utd want to ‘repeat the Casemiro deal’ – which seems a bit strange considering he’s mainly flopped at Old Trafford – by making an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid midfielder Valverde.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Foden, Frank, Sunderland, Paqueta, Arsenal and more…",
      "Man Utd are offering ‘a fixed fee of €100 million plus €20 million in add-ons to try and lure one of the most complete, physically imposing, and decisive players in world football away from Real Madrid’.",
      "The €120m (£105m) fee would be a record-breaking deal for the Red Devils, whose biggest ever purchase was the £89m they paid to Juventus for Paul Pogba in 2016, and INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘want to build a project with Valverde as its cornerstone and don’t hesitate to place him among the most expensive signings in the club’s history.’",
      "There could be a lot of change at Man Utd over the next couple of transfer windows as the Red Devils look to cut their current wage bill – but former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson doubts it will reduced as much as some think.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I don’t think United are going to cut £100m off the wage bill. Wage bills always come down slower than people think. United have already cut the wage bill quite aggressively.",
      "“Every team has got players who are surplus to requirements who you go, ‘Well, of course, we’ll sell these players in the summer and then the wage bill will just collapse and we’ll have a tiny wage bill’. It just never works that way.",
      "“First of all, you can’t always get rid of these players. Some of them come back.",
      "“There’s an interesting situation with Sancho.",
      "“I think he’s got a one-year option that United talked about exercising, but they probably won’t exercise it, so maybe he’ll go for free.",
      "“I think they will probably sell Mainoo, but then that’s more of a profit and not really a massive wage saving because he won’t be on top-tier wages.",
      "“They’ll probably end up keeping Casemiro rather than shipping him out. They’ll probably end up keeping Bruno Fernandes. They’ll probably end up doing a deal to keep Maguire. They might be on reduced salaries, but they’re not going to go to zero. They’ll just trim 25 per cent off.”",

      "But let’s be honest: you’re only here to see which arbitrary section Arsenal have been put in so you can properly word the furious comments that will never be read.",
      "",
      "Chelsea indiscipline probably ought to be addressed at some point but the genuine growth and maturity in their manager and players in such a short space of time has been impressive.",
      "The Blues have had four players sent off since that abhorrent response to an early red card against Manchester United in September and collapse after a red card against Brighton the following week.",
      "That is a problem in itself, and many of those were late on with games already largely settled.",
      "But this was a substantial development. Chelsea lost their best player after 38 minutes against the best team in the league and perhaps world, yet were still the better side thereafter as a result of the coming-of-age of those who managed to stay on the pitch, and the decisions the manager made in response.",
      "",
      "Even Regis Le Bris can’t be sure “what we can achieve this season”. But there is one certainty with Sunderland: “This team has a strong character and they want to fight.”",
      "That much was evident against Bournemouth, which in itself was a neat microcosm of their season. Sunderland have salvaged more points from losing positions than any Premier League club in 2025/26, and here were three more rescued in historic fashion.",
      "Never before in 621 Premier League games had they come from two goals down to win. Yet even when Bournemouth capitalised so ruthlessly on a couple of individual errors in the first 15 minutes it never really felt as though Sunderland were out of it.",
      "As Le Bris said, they have mastered how to “change the dynamic”, to “reset” and to “find solutions”, either from the dugout or on the pitch through the guidance and experience of Granit Xhaka, Nordi Mukiele, Reinildo or any of the numerous other leaders emerging in this squad.",
      "It is a neat trick – remarkable for a promoted club under a manager new to the Premier League, really – to be able to compartmentalise situations and setbacks and respond so emphatically. Sunderland following all three of their defeats so far with a win in the next game (a feat only Arsenal can match and they’ve lost just once) is no happy accident.",
      "",
      "It sums up their early-season malaise that consecutive Premier League wins have lifted Fulham from 15th to 15th. But the complexion of their campaign has transformed: they are closer to a Champions League qualification place than the relegation zone in terms of points.",
      "Marco Silva has landed on a happy balance: the defence is settled; the Iwobi-Berge midfield axis is working; the competition for places in the attacking positions buzzing behind and around the centre-forward is healthy; and Raul Jimenez is still playing that line-leading role impeccably.",
      "When they start as rapidly as in north London and fortune favours that bravery, it is difficult to work out quite why they have struggled so fundamentally this season.",
      "Silva credited “the Nigerian boys” for fostering “a great atmosphere” within the squad, and singled out one soaring Super Eagle.",
      "Samu Chukwueze has been Fulham’s best and most decisive player in consecutive games. He leads the entire league for touches in the opposition penalty area per 90 of those who have played more than a handful of minutes, and Spurs could not handle him.",
      "That £21.9m loan option might just be explored; the outcome of Silva’s ongoing contract negotiations could depend on it.",

      "Recent evidence of that promotion has been scant. Foden did impress in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund last month but his last proper scruff-of-the-neck performance might have been as far back as Brentford in January, or the final day of 2023/24.",
      "Foden started something Manchester City inexplicably couldn’t finish and ultimately needed him to. Pep Guardiola has been calling seemingly all season for someone to help Erling Haaland with those bags and finally his prayers were answered.",
      "The previous latest goal to put Manchester City in the lead in the Premier League this season was scored in the 61st minute against Burnley. Some stoppage-time heroics – and Foden being the one to conjure such majesty – was long overdue.",
      "",
      "Rough calculations suggest Nick Woltemade scoring from an Anthony Elanga pass is the second-most expensive goal combination of two summer signings this season behind Benjamin Sesko setting Bryan Mbeumo up against Brighton in October.",
      "Newcastle signing Woltemade and Elanga in part because both those players chose Manchester United instead adds another delicious layer of narrative.",
      "Another interesting Woltemade line: his six domestic goals so far have all been assisted by different players. Newcastle diversifying their supply line is no bad thing.",

      "Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance? Probably not; can’t even instinctively tell you the name of their set-piece coach for a start.",
      "But they are definitely on the right track towards, well, something. Which is more than can be said for the last few years.",
      "The Everton defeat was an abomination, but it seems increasingly like the exception to a new rule the club is trying to implement. Even against Palace they were poor for large periods of the game and could have been further behind at half time.",
      "Yet that only reinforces how things are changing slowly under Amorim. Where once they would have been swept away by that sort of storm, this group is learning how to weather it and emerge for the better.",
      "That was the first time they had ‘won’ a second half in the Premier League all season, and it earned them three valuable points with two more players stepping up from the periphery.",
      "",
      "Returning to the scene of his lowest day as Brighton manager must have been difficult but Hurzeler underlined how quickly he learns his lessons; oh to be 32 again.",
      "Brighton had far less of the ball than in that 7-0 thrashing by Nottingham Forest in February, but more shots and, ultimately, purpose.",
      "The painfully long overdue dropping of Carlos Baleba allowed a promising Gomez-Ayari midfield partnership to blossom from the start, before Hurzeler reinforced his position as the leading substitute maker in the Premier League through the introduction of Stefanos Tzimas to seal victory.",
      "Brighton have scored eight goals from the bench in the Premier League this season, at least three more than any other club. That attacking depth is probably the best in the division.",
      "",
      "Of bloody course some of his half-time team talk consisted of citing specific games from February 2025 and December 2023 as a warning to his players about complacency. And of bloody course it worked.",
      "Not sure how Villa are fourth with seven wins in their last eight Premier League games, but having checked a few times over they certainly appear to be.",
      "",
      "Should the best 45 minutes of Leeds’ season override what was probably their worst immediately beforehand, as well as the three hilariously insipid defeats which preceded it?",
      "There is a case to argue that the second-half transformation the visitors underwent at the Etihad actually emphasised why Farke should be sacked rather than strengthening any few remaining arguments for him to stay. Why did it take so long to try something like this?",
      "For so long Leeds have needed a variation on a tired, failing blueprint, with the desire for a different approach painfully obvious. The minute Farke reverts to his beloved 4-3-3, the axe should swing.",
      "But this was finally proof that he can adjust and adapt, even if it was entirely forced by the prospect of a defeat so chastening that unemployment was the only feasible outcome at half time.",
      "When the barrel is staring down at you so forebodingly, it’s almost easier to chuck Dominic Calvert-Lewin on, stick two up top, call for more physicality and go for it with nothing to lose. The real test will be how he sets up from the start against Chelsea in midweek.",
      "But even if Farke, as still expected, is deemed not to be the man who can liberate Leeds, he will always have that second half and what was presumably a barnstorming but beautifully softly-spoken team talk.",
      "",
      "His middle name is Dave. What more do you want? Fine…",
      "",
      "They realistically belong in the undefined, murky, grey area between winners and losers, such is the nature of a draw against an opponent reduced to 10 men for about an hour.",

      "",
      "Another deeply problematic response to another inadequate performance and result, with another historically mid-table manager being crushed by the scrutiny and weight of expectation higher up the ladder.",
      "That was an opportunity Frank earned but one he has equally wasted thus far. The temptation with coaches overachieving further down the food chain is to wonder what they might be capable of with better players, greater facilities and more resources; the mistake is in forgetting to contemplate whether their style and philosophy can be successfully transposed at a grander level.",
      "The overwhelming evidence is that what worked so wonderfully for Brentford simply cannot at Spurs. Fulham have joined Bournemouth in recording their only Premier League away win this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It remains the only venue Wolves have scored in or taken a point from as visitors in 2025/26.",
      "Frank can moralise over what makes a “true Tottenham fan” if he wishes, but it might be an idea to show he is capable of becoming a true Tottenham manager at some point.",
      "",
      "Far be it from anyone to speculate and pontificate about how others should act in such a high-pressured situation. But also needling away at the referee in such a sustained manner as to receive two bookings and ultimately a red card for double dissent, having endured almost two years of an investigation over alleged deliberate cautions which Paqueta himself has claimed derailed his career and impacted his mental health, feels inadvisable. Like, specifically so. As outlined by his legal team.",
      "It was also a bit strange to see Alisson, Cody Gakpo and Curtis Jones make roughly as much effort calming Paqueta down and keeping him away from Darren England as the Brazilian’s West Ham teammates.",
      "Put it this way: if I was Paqueta, I simply would not pick up two suspensions in three games. Even if I did play for West Ham.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola did acknowledge “a part where we have to look at ourselves”, pinpointing Bournemouth’s poor record at conceding from set-pieces in particular.",
      "But not sure claiming the referee “absolutely lost control” when it was he and his side who so specifically did as such really works as a post-match narrative. Being beaten after leading 2-0 and investing time in anything other than introspection only ever comes across, as Iraola said, like the actions of a “bad loser”.",
      "Bournemouth have conceded more goals than all but the bottom four. That’s not poor Tim Robinson’s fault.",
      "",
      "The true consequences of Idrissa Gueye’s actions might have been delayed, but only for so long.",
      "David Moyes and Ruben Amorim actively praising the literal fight shown by the midfielder at Old Trafford always seemed at least slightly disingenuous. Everton holding out for that win reflected well only on the players who managed not to slap a teammate, and abysmally on the hosts who failed to take advantage.",
      "Everton were considerably worse with 11 men against Newcastle than 10 on Monday. Gueye’s absence sapped their energy and solidity and without that flashpoint to bring them together, it was as disjointed a performance as the Hill Dickinson has seen.",
      "With the Senegalese out for two more games and then away on international duty at AFCON soon after, this was a humbling insight into how that period could look for Everton.",
      "Tim Iroegbunam had been quietly impressive but floundered when thrust into that role, making a single tackle before being substituted at half time.",
      "Yet beyond him there is no obvious understudy to Gueye or solution to the problems he leaves behind. It turns out that being so dependent on a 36-year-old might not be the best idea. Or that ‘James Garner’ is not the answer to every question mankind has ever posed.",
      "",
      "No club in the entire Premier League has a worse defensive record in any quarter-hour segment of games from 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75 and 76-90 than Burnley in the final 15 minutes.",
      "Scott Parker’s side have conceded ten goals in those closing stages, with draws against Manchester United, Liverpool, West Ham and Brentford turned into defeats.",
      "Be it substandard game management, poor resilience, inadequate concentration levels or lacklustre fitness – and all four seemed to be a factor against Brentford – that is a trend of dropping points that Burnley really cannot afford to let fester.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Morata’s Pro Evo counterpart continues to imbue about as much confidence as the real thing would in central defence.",
      "Morato’s crime of not being Murillo is forgivable. But the numbers are stark: in his nine most recent Premier League starts dating back to last season, Forest’s record is W0 D2 L7 F5 A18. And some of that run includes when they were good.",
      "The last league game Forest won with Morato starting was the 7-0 at home to Brighton in February; this was not quite the same. After marking thin air for the first goal – with others far more culpable – his brace of weak header back to the keeper and curious choice of backheeling the ball into the path of Stefanos Tzimas will have had the City Ground sports science department quadrupling their order of cotton wool to wrap Murillo in.",
      "As Sean Dyche almost definitely said in the dressing room afterwards: Domo Arigato, Mr Morato.",

      "All eight of the points they have dropped from winning positions this season have come in games after playing in Europe midweek. That solitary win came in August.",
      "As the schedule has congested since then, the lack of proper squad depth has been exposed. Glasner has made the fewest substitutions of any manager who has been in place all season; he is still six behind Vitor Pereira.",

      "Seven defeats in eight Premier League games, and now one win in 19. The last player to score a top-flight goal under Edwards was Alfie Doughty, who spent most of the weekend on the Millwall bench.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Anderson is on a list of ten non-Big Six stars primed for a transfer in 2026, but he is far more likely to leave Forest in the summer than in January.",
      "The former Newcastle United star has had an extraordinary rise since departing his boyhood club, establishing himself as one of the finest defensive midfielders in Europe and a near-certain starter for England at next summer’s World Cup.",
      "Anderson‘s sudden rise is a huge boost for England as he provides a fix in a problem position, and Man Utd appear to hope that he can have the same effect on Amorim’s team.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the Red Devils are crying out for a top-tier No.6 to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement, and Anderson is widely reported to be a preferred target with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and/or Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "READ: Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance?",
      "Man Utd’s willingness to test Brighton’s resolve over £100m-rated Baleba in the summer proves they are aware that they need to sign a new defensive midfielder soon, with Anderson standing out as a perfect fit.",
      "Unfortunately for Man Utd, a January deal involving Anderson has never been likely. This is presumably why they are also reportedly looking at Wolves’ Joao Gomes as a potential low-cost target until they can sign a midfielder of a higher level and price bracket in the summer.",
      "With Anderson, Forest are bound to put financial obstacles in the way of a winter exit as they will know it would be foolish to sell their best player while they are far from safe from relegation and are hoping to progress deep into the Europa League.",
      "Anderson, too, should be against a January move because he would be in a far stronger negotiating position and would have more options once he’s presumably shone as a key player for England at a World Cup.",
      "So it was confusing when it was reported last month that the Red Devils are ‘confident’ of signing Anderson in January for a cut-price fee worth around £70m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, this nonsense report has now been exposed by an update from journalist Sacha Tavolieri, while Man City’s interest is another blow for Man Utd.",
      "Tavolieri claims Man City are ‘in love with Anderson’, while he is ‘giving priority’ to Pep Guardiola’s side over other teams. Also, the ‘only snag’ for this deal is something anyone with their head screwed on was already aware of.",
      "‘The only snag is that Evangelos Marinakis’ demands are far higher than City’s valuations so far, and they have refused to offer Nottingham Forest the £100 million.",
      "‘Whatever happens, Anderson will remain in London in January. His departure is only conceivable after the 2026 World Cup.’",
      "Man Utd (and others) put Newcastle United in their box in the summer window, though Arsenal, Chelsea, Vikor Gyokeres and Liam Delap proved where the Red Devils are in the pecking order, so Anderson’s reported transfer stance is justified.",
      "And while it is conceivable that United outbid City to gain favour for Anderson, it would still take a large portion of next year’s budget to sign him, and they have no hope of landing when a new midfielder is ideally required in January.",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will not be signing Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘confident’ that they can seal a cut-price deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes thinks Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson would be a “really good signing” for Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson with the Gunners ‘not backing down’ over his price tag."

      "McTominay has been linked with a return to the Premier League with Everton but former Man Utd striker Louis Saha reckons the Scot should be aiming for Real Madrid or another top team in world football.",

      "Newcastle boss Eddie Howe was also full of praise for Barnes, he said: “Two great goals for Harvey, he missed a couple in the first half, but he is always a player that gets chances, and that is the great thing about him. When you put him on the team sheet, you know there is going to be some moments.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear to the Manchester United board that he does not want to offload Joshua Zirkzee in January and believes the Dutchman has now earned the right to prove his worth to the club – while the Portuguese’s thoughts on letting Kobbie Mainoo move on can also be revealed.",
      "The Dutch forward has not had an easy time of things since moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m (€42.5m, $49.5m) deal from Bolonga in summer 2024. While he scored on his debut, a 1-0 win over Fulham at the start of the 2024/25 campaign, Zirkzee has netted only eight times in his 56 appearances for United, while just three assists show he’s not really good enough to play as a No.10 either.",
      "However, the 24-year-old spent the recent international break preparing for his big opportunity in the team as Manchester United reacted to Benjamin Sesko’s injury.",
      "Amorim has always admired Zirkzee on a technical level, but has been unsure how to fit him into the team’s plan.",
      "However, after spending a lot of time coaching the player and working on his game in a programme designed to not just work out his role for the club but how they could unlock his full potential within the current set-up, United and Amorim are now starting to see their efforts bear fruit.",
      "And while Zirkzee has been linked with a move away – and Roma are confirmed admirers of the player and are very much open to a January deal if an arrangement could be agreed – this spell was always viewed as a pivotal period in determining his future.",
      "If it had gone badly, then United were willing to open up to a departure. However, he scored a good goal in the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday, and sources are now suggesting that Amorim is now very much keen to keep him for the rest of the season.",
      "IN-DEPTH 🔴⚫ Five strikers Man Utd could target in the January transfer window as Zirkzee Plan B",
      "An exit has never been pushed by the boss because he is concerned about the lack of depth and likes the fact that Zirkzee understands his game plans.",
      "And with Zirkzee on the scoresheet and helping United overturn a 1-0 half-time deficit to win 2-1 at Selhurst Park, Amorim was quick to praise the Netherlands international.",
      "“It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball, so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "The game also saw Kobbie Mainoo enter the action as a 90th-minute substitute, meaning he has still only played 170 minutes of action in the Premier League this season – and all eight of his appearances have come off the bench, with none as a starter.",
      "Also strongly linked with a January departure, the midfielder still faces a fight to get a move to another team in January, with Amorim only willing to sanction his exit if a replacement is signed first.",
      "Zirkzee, meanwhile, had played just 82 minutes combined across this Premier League season leading into the last international break, but has played the full 90 minutes of their last two games.",
      "As a result, Amorim is aware that it only takes one injury for the situation to change; hence the manager’s unwillingness to let the 20-year-old midfielder leave without a fight.",
      "Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
      "On the subject of potential new midfielders, United have been given a golden opportunity to sign Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher, as speculation ramps up over a potential January switch to Old Trafford.",
      "As reported by TEAMtalk transfer insider Fraser Fletcher, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson top the shortlist.",
      "But the trio will all command fees north of £70m, perhaps even as high as £100m, so their potential signings will likely have to wait until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, showcased exactly why United should move for him with an outstanding first-half display in Palace’s 2-1 defeat to the Red Devils, and with sources able to shed light on the likelihood of a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "In other news, a shock report claims United have presented a ‘contract offer’ to Antoine Semenyo, after holding a meeting with his representatives on Wednesday last week.",

      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances which now incredibly sees Frank-less Brentford above Frank’s Tottenham.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely.

It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after runs of four straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs go to Newcastle – where their recent record is utterly horrific – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ does anything more than delay the inevitable ahead of Chelsea, before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United beating Palace ‘had some SERIOUS caveats attached. And Thomas Frank and Arne Slot show why there will not be another Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘seriously considering’ a Tottenham Hotspur target replace head coach Ruben Amorim for three reasons.",
      "Arne Slot, Ruben Amorim, Thomas Frank…they will all be thrown from the top-floor window of the Premier League’s gaudy, gold skyscraper of excess.",

      "The PFA Player of the Year award for the 2024/25 season was given as expected to Mo Salah, who also won the Golden Boot, the Premier League and a massive new contract.",
      "This season it might go to Erling Haaland for scoring all of the goals, or an Arsenal player for the first time since Robin van Persie.",
      "",
      "These are the current 50/1 shots: Granit Xhaka (Sunderland), Rodri (Manchester City), Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth), Cole Palmer (Chelsea), Phil Foden (Manchester City).",
      "",
      "The first of six Arsenal players; he has been brilliant so far for his new club but it seems incredibly unlikely that he would get the vote ahead of Rice.",
      "",
      "What can we keep saying about Arsenal? They will probably win the title but the PFA votes will be split so the final award might go to Erling Haaland almost by default (and for scoring all of the goals).",
      "",
      "A phenomenal performance against Liverpool was enough to shorten the odds of the Belgian winger to win the PFA award while Manchester City’s chances of winning the Premier League title were massively boosted.",
      "",
      "Yet another Arsenal player; he has been brilliant so far for his new club and you get the sense that he is popular amongst his peers.",
      "",
      "If Arsenal do win the Premier League, it is likely to be on the foundations of their defence. And Gabriel is key to that defence. Jamie Carragher calls him ‘the most influential player in the Premier League’.",
      "",
      "Still Arsenal’s most reliable source of creativity, though he has actually only claimed three Premier League goals and zero assists this season. It seems unlikely that he will be the key to Arsenal finally winning the Premier League, though his popularity might earn him a few votes.",
      "",
      "If Arsenal do win the Premier League, it is likely to be on the foundations of their set-pieces. And Declan Rice is key to those set-pieces. He might also be the best midfielder in Europe bar none on current form.",

      "The favourite to win the Golden Boot is a former winner; will his goals be enough to put the Premier League trophy back into Manchester City’s sticky mitts again?"

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firmed up again. Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, conceding only one in the last four games from a PSxG of 3.5.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (78%).",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario has conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive. Back to being solid at Palace.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that have taken the Spaniard into the black.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have lost one in seven. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Tables are fun, aren’t they? And we’ve got loads of them, based on all the metrics you could possibly need. Create your own too, between any dates or on a specific date. Enjoy yourself here.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",
      "",
      "The Bournemouth keeper is a massive faller in the last three games after conceding nine from a PSxG of 5.2 against Villa, West Ham and Sunderland.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",
      "A fifth of Premier League clubs have Newcastle to thank for their best player this season, even if the Toon’s highest-rated star was a more savvy piece of business…",
      "Has Thomas Frank really been stupid enough to ‘infuriate’ Spurs fans by policing expectations after having a go at them over booing Guglielmo Vicario?",
      "With Mo Salah finally dropped from Liverpool’s Premier League starting XI to immediate return-to-winning-ways effect, which other undroppables might fall?",
      "Manchester United beating Palace ‘had some SERIOUS caveats attached. And Thomas Frank and Arne Slot show why there will not be another Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Lucas Paqueta is not getting any sympathy even from the woke folk while Arsenal fans do not really know how to feel.",
      "Thomas Frank lands himself another spot in the losers alongside Lucas Paqueta, Bournemouth and Everton. How they all wish they could be Sunderland."

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek card and wants to back Fulham to beat Manchester City.",
      "Odds of 5/2 with Sky Bet for an Everton win certainly catch the eye when you dig into Bournemouth's recent defensive slide.",
      "The Cherries are conceding goals at a rate that should concern Andoni Iraola, with 15 shipped in their last six games. The departures of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi are now being felt, stripping Bournemouth of both mobility and composure in central areas. The situation is compounded further by Marcos Senesi's suspension here, leaving Iraola without his most reliable defender in terms of timing, duels and experience of the Premier League.",
      "Everton thrive on territory, pressure and set-piece moments, precisely the areas where Bournemouth have begun to wobble. Under David Moyes, they've won seven of 15 away days. That could become eight.",
      "Manchester City's away form has developed a whiff of vulnerability that makes the 4/6 with Sky Bet for an away win look very skinny. The bookmakers must be quietly confident of getting Pep Guardiola's team beat here.",
      "City's problems aren't headline-grabbing collapses, they're subtle, the sort of issues that only appear when you start peeking a bit deeper. Across their last 17 Premier League away games, City are averaging just 1.19 goals scored per game. That's mid-table output - far from the title-winning days where they'd be averaging nearly two goals per game on the road. It's not a metric of dominant, odds-on favourites.",
      "Marco Silva's men can be ragged on their travels but at Craven Cottage they play with much more cohesion. Only Arsenal have conceded fewer (2) than Silva's men (3) in home matches this season.",
      "Fulham draw no bet at 5/2 with Sky Bet is a big price.",
      "Tottenham arrive at St James' Park carrying all the hallmarks of a team running on fumes in the final third.",
      "Across the season they're averaging just 9.5 shots per game and 3.2 shots on target per game, their lowest Premier League output since Opta started collating the data. Spurs remain a team that struggle to generate anything resembling sustained pressure.",
      "The underlying numbers paint an even bleaker picture. Spurs have posted an expected goals tally under 1.0 in each of their last four Premier League matches, and in seven of their last eight. That isn't a blip, that's an identity crisis. Thomas Frank is already under serious pressure.",
      "Newcastle are a beast at home, too. The intensity, the physicality, the speed of their press. Opponents get smothered long before they reach the final third.",
      "With Tottenham's chance creation non-existent and Newcastle's defensive metrics at St James' Park consistently strong, the win to nil at 2/1 with Sky Bet becomes the natural landing spot for the value hunters.",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas."

      "Fulham vs Man City - Tuesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "When Erling Haaland hit his 99th Premier League goal in Manchester City's 3-0 win over Liverpool on November 9, it seemed only a matter of time before he would join the '100 Club', where only 34 players in the competition's history have scored a century or more.",
      "But despite playing the entirety of the games against Newcastle and Leeds that followed, that milestone goal has so far eluded him. This two-game barren spell is rare - but looks likely to end on Tuesday night if history is anything to go by.",
      "The Norwegian has scored six goals in six Premier League appearances against Fulham, the most of any player since the Cottagers returned to the top flight in 2022/23. The last was a penalty on the final day of 2024/25.",
      "Standing in the way is a Fulham team that has thrived on home soil so far, though. Last term, they picked up 26 points at Craven Cottage, averaging 1.36 points per game. They already have 13 this season, which equates to a hugely improved average of 2.17.",
      "Only Arsenal (2) have conceded less than the three they have shipped at home so far.",
      "Fulham's fortress will either deny Haaland history again, or be the stage on which he finally writes it.Dan Long",
      "Bournemouth vs Everton - Tuesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "The Premier League comes at you fast - and no one knows that better than Bournemouth.",
      "At the end of October, Andoni Iraola's side were sitting pretty in fifth place in the Premier League, unbeaten in seven, with their only loss coming to champions Liverpool on the opening day of the season. But, in just a month, their fortunes have completely changed.",
      "November was - to put it politely - dismal. The Cherries picked up one point out of a possible 12 - a point salvaged from two down at home to strugglers West Ham - and conceded a whopping 12 goals in their four outings to boot.",
      "Their sudden loss of form has seen them drop to 11th in the table, only two points ahead of Fulham in 15th. To keep up early-season hopes of European football, something needs to change - and fast.",
      "The south coast side face perhaps the perfect opponents in Everton. They are still unbeaten at home and have more Premier League wins, goals and points against the Toffees than any other side in their history.",
      "The visitors' striker, Thierno Barry, is not exactly in the kind of form that strikes fear into defenders' hearts. The Frenchman has yet to register a shot on target in 551 league minutes and looked limp in his side's 4-1 home drubbing to Newcastle on Saturday.",
      "Bournemouth might have an easier night's sleep ahead of Tuesday's game. It's exactly the sort of fixture they need to revive their form; but a first loss at the Vitality will see serious questions start to be asked heading into the busiest period of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Newcastle vs Spurs - Tuesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "It's toxic at Tottenham - and not for the first time.",
      "Go back to the 2021/22 season and Spurs had beaten Manchester City, but early momentum was quashed by damning home defeats to Chelsea and Arsenal. In a game against Manchester Utd, a Spurs substitution was booed by their own fans, who were not impressed with their new head coach's style of play.",
      "Sound familiar?",
      "Thomas Frank's start to life at Spurs bares a very similar resemblance to Nuno Espirito Santo's short, ill-fated reign in north London. And given Nuno was sacked after 10 games, with the supporters' trust saying he was \"not the right manager\" for the club, it's not a good sign for the Dane.",
      "With the shadow of the trophy-winning Ange Postecoglou still looming over Spurs' situation, there is deep unrest.",
      "There are issues involving the players - with Guglielmo Vicario and Pedro Porro's supporter drama in Saturday's loss to Fulham following the Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence spat of frustration after the loss to Chelsea. But will Frank become the one mainly in the fire soon?",
      "Spurs are in the bottom three in the Premier League this season for shots and chances created, while only one Premeir League team has given the ball away more times. They have also made a league-high 12 errors leading to a shot.",
      "Frank will point to the fact he is at the start of a rebuilding project - and his desire to \"add layers\" to this team. But with Spurs going to Newcastle - a team they've already lost to this season in the Carbaao Cup - how much are their restless fans willing to take?Sam Blitz",
      "Arsenal vs Brentford - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Arsenal were not themselves at Chelsea. They were off the pace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Several misplaced passes in the build-up phase and they lost the duel battle to Chelsea. They lost two-thirds of their first 24 duels in the opening quarter of the game, while they only won one of the first 10 aerial duels.",
      "There were several factors behind it. Chelsea played well - having had an extra day to prepare after their midweek European action - while the absences of William Saliba and Gabriel filtered throughout the team to create an unconvincing display.",
      "It has also been a busy schedule. \"It's been a big week,\" said Mikel Arteta after overcoming the triple header of Spurs, Bayern Munich and the Blues last week. So is it time for the Arsenal manager to rotate?",
      "Wednesday night's visit of Brentford may be a good opportunity to give minutes to those who need it, but more crucially rest those who have been called upon a lot.",
      "For example, Ben White could come in for Jurrien Timber. The likes of Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres are aiming for first starts after injury. Even Christian Norgaard, against his former club, and Ethan Nwaneri could be called upon.",

      "It cannot just be a coincidence that Liverpool kept their first Premier League clean sheet since they beat Aston Villa a month ago - and only their third all season in the top flight - in their much-needed win at West Ham United on Sunday in a game that also saw Joe Gomez make his first league start in almost a year, incidentally also in a victory at the London Stadium.",
      "Despite a series of calamitous recent defensive displays, including a 3-0 loss to struggling Nottingham Forest, followed by a 4-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven - both at Anfield - in the lead-up to the game, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had been stubbornly resisting calls to start Gomez, who has been carrying a slight knee niggle of late.",
      "But the versatile 28-year-old returned on the right-hand side of the champions' defence in east London, with the Reds immediately looking more assured at the back, with no visiting player making more interceptions, while he also created their second goal for Coady Gakpo.",

      "Oliver Glasner bemoaned his side's lack of business, calling for some level of sympathy as his side tired in their defeat to Manchester United. However, in their ascendancy, Palace failed to capitalise on a rampant first half, which could be costing them more than their squad depth.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta, who took his tally of big chances missed up to 12 against United, is only behind Erling Haaland for big chances spurned.",
      "Creativity was the main concern for Palace when Eberechi Eze moved on to pastures new in the summer. However, creating isn't what's holding Palace back; it's their inability to score.",
      "Burnley will provide the sternest test of Palace's ability to find the back of the net. Scott Parker's Clarets have the league's highest expected goals against with 28.79, meaning - on paper - there will be ample opportunity to exorcise their big-chance demons.William Bitibiri",

      "The last time the club fell to that many defeats was during the 2011/12 season, during Terry Connor's infamous reign, which was an all-time low in a relegation season.",

      "There's been no such issues for Brighton striker Danny Welbeck, who has only been getting better at 35. His seven goals, combined with the efforts of Yankuba Minteh, have powered Fabian Hurzeler's side up the table.",

      "That goal, Mount's second of the season, came minutes after Joshua Zirkzee ended a year-long wait for a Premier League goal with a finish from what looked like an impossible angle.",
      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",

      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",
      "Perhaps there are signs of complacency in their leads that Amorim has to fix while also finding a way to motivate faster starts.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",

      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",

      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",

      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",

      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",

      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",

      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 09:19, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",

      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",
