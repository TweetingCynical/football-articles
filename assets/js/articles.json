      "Michael Carrick will be Casemiro's final manager at Manchester United(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Casemiro's impending exit from Manchester United will shave £15.6million from their wage bill. The Red Devils announced the former Real Madrid midfielder will walk away from Old Trafford at the end of the current campaign.",
      "His contract expires at the end of June, meaning he will depart as a free agent. He has been one of the highest earners at the club since his shock arrival from Los Blancos in Erik ten Hag's first campaign as United boss.",
      "But there is also a reason why United have announced the 33-year-old's exit now instead of waiting for the season to come to its climax.",
      "Casemiro's exit means the next United manager will have an extra £15.6m per year to work with on their wage bill. However, it's also understood Casemiro would have been in line for another £2.6m if the Reds qualified for the Champions League.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Making the announcement now guarantees the club will not have to pay Casemiro this bonus. It may also comes as a relief to interim manager Michael Carrick, as it means his goal of Champions League qualification will not bring any financial cost to the club, if he is able to achieve it.",
      "The Brazilian played a huge role in Carrick's first match of his second spell as temporary manager. Playing alongside Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in midfield, Casemiro was outstanding in the 2-0 victory over Manchester City.",
      "The news about Casemiro's departure was revealed this evening(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "His future at Old Trafford has been finite ever since Sir Jim Ratcliffe came in with the aim of signing younger players and cutting the salary bill down. However, it was a performance which suggested Casemiro is still a huge asset.",
      "Interestingly, there was a clause in his contract suggesting a one-year extension would be triggered if he started 35 matches this season. He would have to start every match from now until the end of the campaign for this clause to be triggered.",
      "If there was any slight possibility of this happening, it was essentially ended by the announcement from the club. In his own message to United fans, many of which have been divided by the South American's contributions, he said: “I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life.",
      "Casemiro was outstanding against City(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",

      "It is almost two years since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired his stake in Manchester United(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "For one of the richest businessmen in the world, Sir Jim Ratcliffe appears to be facing unusual financial worries. According to many reports, there is the small matter of his Ineos petrochemicals empire carrying a debt burden of £18billion.",
      "No wonder Sir Jim - a legendary penny-pincher at the best of times - has been cost-cutting with some gusto. On the business front, three factories in Germany are going, along with a facility in Ohio. Twenty percent of the workforce at a plant in Hull were made redundant late last year.",
      "On the sporting front, Ineos have pulled their involvement in America’s Cup sailing and ended a sponsorship arrangement with the All Blacks. There were recent claims that Ratcliffe has slashed the £170million asking price for his controlling stake in OGC Nice, currently fourth from bottom of the Ligue Un table.",
      "But if Ratcliffe wanted some really jolting financial news, it came with the publication of Deloitte’s annual Football Money League. The long and the short of the figures is that, in a 12-month period that takes in the 2024/25 season, mighty Manchester United collected a revenue total that was less than SEVEN other clubs in Europe and THREE other clubs in the Premier League.",
      "United should be THE money-generating powerhouse in English football and on a par with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Instead, United’s revenue was over £300million LESS than Real Madrid’s - £692million to £1.013billion.",
      "It was £159million less than the amount generated by Barcelona and £59million less than Bayern Munich earned. Liverpool (£729million), Manchester City (£723million) and Arsenal (£717million) are all ahead of United in the revenue table.",
      "Michael Carrick got his spell as Manchester United coach off to a flying start in the derby at Old Trafford(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Now, some of the reasons why United are in a relatively lowly spot in the financial rankings need context. The stadium brings in 70,000-plus but does not maximise matchday revenue and of the top eight in the table, only Arsenal have a smaller wage bill than United.",
      "But there is a brutal truth about United’s place in this financial table - a truth that has only been heightened since Ratcliffe acquired a 27.7 percent stake in the club for £1.25billion in early 2024. United’s mediocrity on the field of play means their financial pre-eminence in European football has been badly damaged.",
      "And it will be irreparably damaged if Ratcliffe, his executives and the Glazers do not get the football appointments right at the end of this season. First of all, it would be helpful if United secure a Champions League spot for next season.",
      "The area in which United were financially trounced in 2024/25 was broadcast revenue. Liverpool, City and Arsenal all brought in at least £100million more than United’s £180million. The 2025/26 figures will not be any better for United.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his advisers made an expensive mistake when hiring Ruben Amorim(Image: Michael Regan - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Quite simply, they need to be re-established as a club that does not miss a Champions League season, let alone a European season in any form, as it did for 2025/26. If Ratcliffe and his people think Michael Carrick is the man that can ensure that, then fine.",
      "But what Ratcliffe and the Glazers then need to do is give him - or whoever they decide should manage the team next season - muscular financial backing. Look, you don’t win a big pot for coming top of the Deloitte’s Football Money League.",
      "There is no open-top bus parade for being revenue champions of Europe. But this is another stark reminder that, having made a costly mistake with Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim and his people cannot afford to keep messing up the football business.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Nevertheless, with Neves' contract set to expire this summer, he's understood to have attracted suitors willing to facilitate his return to Europe before the conclusion of the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "Consequently, Al-Hilal are reportedly accepting of losing the Portugal international, with £18million believed to be sufficient to secure his signature in January. United are among those being linked - with the Reds looking to bolster their midfield options - especially with Casemiro on his way.",
      "Fernandes revealed to The Standard, in December, that he had been in touch with Neves after he was connected to Al Hilal during the summer. He said: \"The person who spoke to me was the president of Al-Hilal - who called me directly.",
      "\"Ruben Neves sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me. They wanted me to play in the Club World Cup with Al-Hilal.\"",
      "\"It was already a love that came from the Jorge Jesus era. He had already called me in 2023.\"",
      "Ruben Neves has been linked with a transfer to Man Utd.(Image: (Photo by Jose Manuel Alvarez Rey/Getty Images))",

      "Speaking with Portuguese broadcaster Sport TV last August, Neves opened up about his ambition to re-join his boyhood side, FC Porto. \"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive; that's my big goal,\" he said.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28-years-old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club - it's something that I want to give them and experience [for myself].",

Whether it's this month under interim boss Michael Carrick or - perhaps more likely - when a permanent appointment is made in the summer, the squad could well get a proper refresh.",
      "It has been a quiet window so far, with the exception of Carrick stepping in after Ruben Amorim's dismissal. There have been no new additions on the playing side but there has been one exit, with young winger Sam Mather joining Turkish side Kayserispor.",

While it remains to be seen whether United and Chelsea would be able to thrash out a summer deal, former Blues star Marcel Desailly has urged the England international to leave Stamford Bridge - just not yet.",
      "\"I believe Palmer wants more stability and a system that’s built for him, but he still needs to fully recover from his groin injury and get back to full fitness,\" Desailly told Card Player. \"His recent performances speak for themselves, so he needs to stay humble and come back into the team to help the club, regardless of whether he stays or goes.",
      "Cole Palmer in action for Chelsea(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "\"The question is whether he feel like Chelsea are going to win the Premier League in the next two seasons. If he doesn’t, I’m sure he will ask for a transfer request to a club that will build a system around him. For now, however, he needs to hit his previous levels for Chelsea to help them and their new manager through this period.\"",
      "Roma will test Manchester United's resolve with a concrete bid for Joshua Zirkzee, according to Sky in Italy. The publication reports that the Giallorossi had been waiting for United to get Bryan Mbeumo back from the Africa Cup of Nations before returning to the negotiating table.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee continues to be linked with a January move(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Zirkzee is reported to be keen to fight for his place at Old Trafford but Roma are ready to pounce if he changes his mind. The Dutch international missed the weekend win over Manchester City with a minor injury but has struggled for regular minutes this season on the whole.",
      "He still has a high reputation in Italy thanks to his form helping Bologna qualify for the Champions League in 2024. His performances under Thiago Motta prompted United to splash the cash but Zirzkee has been unable to consistently hit top gear since scoring a winner against Fulham on his debut.",
      "Juventus were also linked with the forward when Motta was their manager but those links have died down. Roma's preference, it is claimed, is for a loan with a conditional option to buy in the summer.",

      "Victoria Beckham has been accused of \"inappropriate\" behaviour by her son Brooklyn(Image: Getty Images for Reebok)",
      "Victoria Beckham is no stranger to raising a few eyebrows. Amid fresh accusations from her son Brooklyn Beckham about her behaviour behind closed doors, an old anecdote has resurfaced that paints a very different, if still surprising, picture of the former Spice Girl.",
      "The fashion designer has been thrust under the microscope this week following Brooklyn's explosive Instagram post. On Monday, the 26-year-old - the oldest child of Victoria and Sir David Beckham - blasted his parents in a savage statement. He claimed he'd been \"controlled\" by them and accused the pair of trying to \"ruin\" his relationship with his wife Nicola Peltz Beckham.",
      "He levelled particularly stinging accusations at his mother, asserting that she \"cancelled\" making Nicola's wedding dress at the last minute. He also claimed that she called him \"evil\" and \"hijacked\" his first dance with Nicola, before dancing \"very inappropriately\".",
      "While these claims remain unverified, they have prompted renewed scrutiny of Victoria's conduct at family events - and they are not the first stories to leave people surprised by her behaviour at a celebration involving one of her sons.",
      "Back in 2007, shortly after Sir David's high-profile move to LA Galaxy, the Beckhams hosted a birthday party for one of their children, inviting the club's players and their families. Years later, Carlos Pavon Jr - son of former Galaxy striker Carlos Pavon - recalled that Victoria stole the show at the party, not just among the adults, but with the kids as well.",
      "\"I was playing with [Beckham's] son on the inflatable trampoline and we were jumping, and then out of nowhere, I notice the kid's mum comes in, David's wife, Victoria,\" Pavon Jr told the La Pelota Al DIEZ podcast.",
      "\"She started jumping with us and I was like, 'I can't believe I'm doing this with Victoria Beckham,' so I think that was the funniest thing. Everybody saw when she came in and started jumping with us, so when I came out, I think they all saw my surprised face, like, 'Wow, that just happened.' It was really funny.\"",
      "Tensions within the Beckham family have reportedly been simmering for years. Brooklyn's relationship with Nicola began in 2019, with the pair getting engaged in 2020 before eventually tying the knot in 2022. While relations were said to be warm at first, cracks began to emerge in the lead-up to the wedding.",
      "Victoria Beckham delighted guests by bouncing on the bouncy castle at her son's birthday party shortly after David's move to LA Galaxy(Image: Ted Soqui/Corbis via Getty Images)",
      "A major source of friction is believed to centre on the controversy surrounding Nicola's wedding dress. It's understood that she had initially planned to wear a gown designed by Victoria's fashion label but ultimately walked down the aisle in a custom Valentino creation instead.",
      "According to Brooklyn, the change was not by choice. He alleges that Victoria \"cancelled making Nicola's dress in the eleventh hour... forcing her to urgently find a new dress.\" He has also claimed that on the night before the wedding, family members told him Nicola was \"not blood\" and \"not family.\"",
      "Brooklyn also claimed that Victoria called him \"evil\" during planning because he chose to seat his and Nicola's grandmothers at the top table rather than prioritising his parents.",
      "Rumours of a rift began circulating - and while attempts to quash those rumours with several joint public appearances together helped, things escalated in 2025 when Brooklyn and Nicola decided not to attend David's 50th birthday party. Months later, David and Victoria were notably absent from Brooklyn and Nicola's vow renewal ceremony, signalling a deep divide.",
      "Tensions in the Beckham family have been simmering for years(Image: Samir Hussein/WireImage)",
      "In December last year, reports surfaced that Brooklyn had blocked both his parents and siblings on social media. A few weeks later, he reportedly sent a legal letter to his parents demanding all future communication go through his lawyers.",
      "\"I have been silent for years and made every effort to keep these matters private,\" Brooklyn said on Monday. \"Unfortunately my parents and their team have continued to go to the press, leaving me with no choice but to speak for myself and tell the truth about only some of the lies that have been printed.",
      "\"I do not want to reconcile with my family. I'm not being controlled, I'm standing up for myself for the first time in my life. For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family.",
      "\"The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.\"",
      "He added: \"My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped... My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\"",
      "Brooklyn (R) slammed his parents in an explosive statement on social media this week(Image: Getty)",
      "He ended by saying: \"My wife has been consistently disrespected by my family, no matter how hard we've tried to come together as one. My mum has repeatedly invited women from my past into our lives in ways that were clearly intended to make us both uncomfortable.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Sir David broke his silence on the controversy. The former England and Manchester United footballer acknowledged that his children had \"made mistakes\" on social media, while stressing that they are \"allowed\" to do so - insisting it is part of how they learn.",
      "\"What kids can access these days, it can be dangerous. But what I have found personally, especially with my kids as well, use it for the right reasons,\" he told CNBC. \"I've been able to use my platform for my following, for UNICEF. And it has been the biggest tool to make people aware of what’s going on around the world for children.",

With United expected to appoint a permanent boss in the summer, the club's long-term strategy regarding transfers - both in terms of arrivals and departures - remains unclear.",
      "Despite this uncertainty, former United forward Giuseppe Rossi believes Carrick should pursue a deal to bring Napoli's McTominay back to Old Trafford in a sensational return, more than a year after his £25million switch to the Italian club.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, the former Italy international suggested Carrick's caretaker role gives him the chance to lure McTominay back to his boyhood club. He said: \"Bring back Scott McTominay! You can't get a player now and then change for a different player in the summer.",

      "\"It's all up to the coach. I feel that's all up in the air. You can't really go out and start buying players if you know the coaching situation yet. I always say McTominay because he would actually be a good player for Manchester United at this moment.\"",
      "Whether the Scotland international would be willing to return to United remains uncertain, given the remarkable success he's enjoyed since moving to Naples. Not only did he help secure the league title last season, but he was also named Serie A MVP and received his first ever Ballon d'Or nomination.",
      "Michael Carrick has been told to target Scott McTominay(Image: Joe Prior/Visionhaus via Getty Images)",
      "Previously, McTominay addressed the common perception that players who depart Old Trafford tend to thrive elsewhere, suggesting the improvement is typically down to increased playing time at their new clubs.",

      "Michael Carrick hasn't taken long to make an impact at Manchester United(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick's players, both former and current, have endorsed the Manchester United head coach's training methods. Carrick has taken the role for the rest of the season after Ruben Amorim was dismissed, having failed to establish his vision during 14 difficult months at the helm.",
      "With the task of delivering Champions League qualification, Carrick has moved quickly to implement changes both on and off the field. The initial indicators look extremely encouraging after Saturday's derby triumph against Manchester City.",
      "Among the alterations Carrick - backed by assistant Steve Holland and coaches Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans - has introduced are shorter but more demanding training sessions.",
      "Instructions have been direct and clear, while there's been greater emphasis on individual coaching. One player who's been won over by Carrick's methods is experienced centre-back Harry Maguire. After the victory over City, he commented: \"He's got great ideas. He speaks really well. Tactically, he's really, really good.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"And obviously, now he's had a lot of experience at Middlesbrough as a manager. And I'm sure he's going to come in here and implement his ideas.\"",
      "The 32-year-old continued: \"I must say, with him and all his coaching staff, I've been really impressed this week. He's trying to bring new energy, new ideas, without drilling us too much at this moment tactically. I think he just wants to bring the energy back in the building. That's so important.\"",
      "Players Carrick managed at Middlesbrough, the club he departed last summer, were equally taken with his approach. Caolan Boyd-Munce, currently at League One Wycombe, praised his ability to make things simple.",
      "He told TeesideLive: \"I remember in the first week he took us as a midfield four. We had a session just the four us and the drills he was doing... You might call it basic stuff but it was the way he explained and described it. It just made so much sense.",
      "\"We were thinking, 'How have we not seen this before? Everything he does and says, he just simplifies everything and makes it so easy to understand.",
      "Harry Maguire is enjoying working with Carrick(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "\"I think there's a perception that he'll be in the changing room going really in-depth and detailed into everything. But quite the opposite, he just breaks the game down so simply.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Jonny Howson, 37, who has moved into coaching himself with Leeds United U21s, revealed how Carrick left players in no doubt about his expectations and wouldn't hesitate to stop training if standards slipped.",
      "He told The Athletic: \"Until you deal with someone day-to-day, you don't realise why he was at the top for so many years. He never accepted, or accepts, where he's at. He always wanted to get better. He's said that to us numerous times.",
      "Carrick has been praised for his communication skills(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's a good atmosphere, calm, inside the building but when you're out on the training pitch, he will let you know if it's not being done right. We've seen that a few times. He will stop a session or a drill and tell you it's not good enough.\"",

      "Manchester United supporter group 'the 1958' have confirmed another demonstration against the Glazer family and Sir Jim Ratcliffe will take place at the upcoming home fixture against Fulham. They have warned more than 6,000 disgruntled supporters are expected to participate.",
      "This weekend, Michael Carrick's team head to the Emirates Stadium to take on Premier League leaders Arsenal. However, at the subsequent home encounter with the Cottagers, fans will stage a protest against the Glazers and minority owner Ratcliffe, who has been managing the football side of operations at the club.",
      "The Glazers have faced criticism from United supporters ever since their takeover in 2005, while discontent has also grown toward Ratcliffe, following his £1.6billion acquisition of 27.7% of the club. As anger continues to spread throughout the fanbase, the 1958 have confirmed further action against the United hierarchy.",
      "A spokesperson for the 1958 said: \"Twenty-one years of a debt mountain, mismanagement and financial greed is 21 years too long. Enough is enough.\"",

We were promised best in class, but for us the club is a laughing stock resembling a circus, and that includes the new stadium design.\"",
      "Elaborating on why they've chosen to take action, the group added: \"Earlier this season, we asked supporters if they wanted to protest. Many chose to give Ratcliffe time.",
      "There will be more protests against the Glazer family and Sir Jim Ratcliffe by Man United fans(Image: 2025 Jean Catuffe)",

      "It hasn't taken long for Michael Carrick to win over those at Old Trafford after returning to Manchester United as interim manager. His achievements at Middlesbrough had already suggested the sort of influence he could have on the playing squad in Manchester, though, with Boro's players making their feelings clear.",
      "Carrick managed Boro for more than two seasons, securing fourth place in the Championship during his debut campaign and delivering two additional top-half finishes afterwards. He had to deal with upheaval in that period, losing crucial players including Chuba Akpom and Morgan Rogers and being forced to rebuild.",
      "The manager rejoined United, where he played for more than ten years, following Ruben Amorim's dismissal as manager. His opening fixture as interim boss brought an impressive derby win, with United deserving of their three points after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu.",
      "Carrick's impact on his players was already clear to some from his previous role. Several of Carrick's former Middlesbrough players have spoken warmly about the 44-year-old over the years and there's a hope he might be able to make a similar impact off the pitch at Old Trafford.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Honestly, he is a pleasure to work with. I go out there, give 110 per cent and I want to fight for the manager, as he has put so much trust and confidence in me and I really appreciate it. I had to dedicate that [goal] to the gaffer.",
      "\"Immediately, when he came in, he put me in the No.10 role and just gave me the license to roam around. If you see me on the pitch, I am just roaming from right to left, and he has given me that freedom to go out there and express myself. I appreciate that so much.\"",
      "Hayden Hackney is another Middlesbrough player who has flourished under Carrick's guidance. The England Under-21 midfielder claimed Boro's young player of the year accolade in Carrick's debut season as manager and has since attracted interest from top-flight sides.",
      "\"I really do appreciate that he's giving me the opportunity. I'm just trying to take it game by game as much as possible,\" Hackney remarked during that opening campaign, elaborating on the specific ways he was being enabled to excel.",
      "Hayden Hackney celebrating a goal for Middlesbrough under Michael Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"I watched him a lot - he was on the TV every week wasn't he at Man Utd? ! He was a great player and I'm grateful to be learning from him.",
      "\"I think it's more the little things - little movements, for example. He's taught me, sometimes I don't need to move that much to get into a bit of space.\"",
      "Carrick rescued Boro from the threat of relegation to secure a play-off position in his debut season, and achieving that would have been difficult without quickly getting his ideas across to the squad. It wasn't only the younger players who embraced his methods, with seasoned defender Tommy Smith sharing his thoughts on the gaffer's style.",
      "\"He's come in with fresh ideas and I think the players have really taken to them and how he wants to approach games,\" Smith told ITV Football in 2023. \"I think the league table shows, the results show, that it's obviously working.",
      "\"The manager would be the first to say that it's not the finished article by any stretch. He's desperate for us to improve and we're desperate to improve as players. There is still a long way to go in the season, but it's looking good. We're playing well as a team. and long may that continue.\"",
      "In the end, Boro couldn't replicate that initial play-off success under Carrick as changes to the squad left the team weaker and performances steadily declined. There's plenty of time for him to demonstrate he can do the same with United.",

      "\"What does Harry not like doing? He doesn't like running back. He's got no pace, he knows that and understands that.That was playing to his strengths with Man City having the ball.\"",
      "Michael Carrick brought Maguire straight back in after a spell out injured(Image: Michael Regan, Getty Images)",
      "\"Playing for England, you've got to adapt a little bit but you have to push up. Particularly in the opening (group) games you're going to have most of the ball, you've got to play a high line, you do not want to get caught out. Harry's been a great servant for Manchester United and for England but I just can't see that.\"",
      "Maguire was involved in all of England's games at both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and also starred at Euro 2020. However, he was absent from Euro 2024 after dealing with injuries in the run-up to the tournament in Germany and has yet to be selected since Thomas Tuchel took the England job in January 2025.",
      "Carrick's decision to immediately recall him at club level was something of a risk, as the man in temporary charge acknowledged when speaking to BBC Match of the Day. \"We were going into the game, and he's literally trained two days out of 45 or so, so it was a big ask,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"He came on the other day for a short period of time (against Brighton in the FA Cup) but again hasn't really trained a whole lot so we've got to manage him. It shows again how much it means to the boys to play, and the boys were going down with all sorts. He got through it he managed him well. He was a big presence at the back for us. He showed that immense experience.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford started on the bench against Slavia Prague(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford reminded Hansi Flick of his quality after being left on the Barcelona bench for the second consecutive match. After netting as a substitute in Sunday's 2-1 La Liga loss at Real Sociedad, the Manchester United loanee was once again omitted from the starting line-up for Barcelona's vital Champions League fixture away to Slavia Prague.",
      "Raphinha was preferred ahead of him on the left flank but delivered a patchy display. Determined to make his mark, Rashford quickly influenced proceedings after coming on for Roony Bardghji in the 61st minute, delivering a cross from the left that Robert Lewandowski converted for Barca's decisive fourth goal in their 4-2 victory.",
      "It was the Polish striker's first Champions League goal of the campaign at the right end, extending his scoring run in the competition to 15 successive seasons. He had earlier put through his own net to level the score at 2-2 just before the interval.",
      "Crucially, the result left Barcelona in ninth place ahead of next week's final round of group fixtures, when they welcome Copenhagen. Victory could be sufficient to secure their passage to the last 16, avoiding the play-off round for sides finishing ninth to 24th.",
      "Remarkably, they are among eight teams level on 13 points, which includes Newcastle, Chelsea and Manchester City. Rashford will be hoping his contribution has earned him a place in Flick's starting line-up for both the Copenhagen encounter and, beforehand, Sunday's home meeting with Oviedo.",
      "He caught the eye of Spanish media with his appearance in Prague. Football Espana awarded him 6.5/10 and noted: \"Fantastic assist for Lewandowski's goal.\"",
      "Rashford celebrates with Robert Lewandowski after Barcelona's fourth goal against Slavia Prague(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The same publication was less impressed with Raphinha, stating: \"Another that was not at his best. Started on the left, before being switched to the right in the second half, but he was poor in both positions.\"",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's sacking, speculation has emerged that Rashford could resurrect his United career under the next permanent manager. However, converting his Barcelona loan into a permanent transfer remains the more probable scenario, with Flick yet to decide on the England international's future in Catalonia.",
      "Hansi Flick is weighing up Rashford's future(Image: Getty Images)",

      "Joleon Lescott and Shaun Wright-Phillips have reached a verdict concerning Kobbie Mainoo(Image: In The Mixer)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo will secure a place in England's World Cup 2026 squad if he maintains his form under Michael Carrick at Manchester United. That's according to former Manchester City stars Joleon Lescott and Shaun Wright-Phillips.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, the young midfielder found first-team opportunities hard to come by at United. Despite impressing for both club and country, the Portuguese manager struggled to accommodate him in his starting XI. Mainoo sought a loan move last summer, with speculation about his departure persisting into January.",
      "However, following 14 months in charge, Amorim has been removed and Carrick is now in control until at least the season's conclusion. His opening match during this managerial spell concluded with an exciting 2-0 derby victory over rivals City, with Mainoo standing out as part of a three-man midfield.",
      "Before Amorim's dismissal, Mainoo's prospects of earning a spot in Thomas Tuchel's Three Lions squad for the forthcoming World Cup in North America appeared virtually non-existent. Yet, according to Wright-Phillips and Lescott, if he continues to feature regularly and perform well at United under Carrick he's guaranteed to make the final selection.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "When asked on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, whether Mainoo will make England's World Cup squad if he continues to perform, Lescott responded: \"100 per cent.\"",
      "Wright-Phillips agreed: \"If he keeps up with these performances, yeah.\" Lescott continued: \"You're not surprised by his performance. He's played like that before, hasn't he? I'm not surprised at all.\"",
      "Amorim benched the young midfielder(Image: Getty)",
      "The former City defender was also questioned about why Mainoo hadn't been getting game time under Amorim. Offering his theory, Lescott suggested: \"I think it was just a personal thing. Managers don't like certain players regardless of whether it's as a footballer or as a person.",
      "\"There's got to be something. There's got to be an element of that because he can't have not featured and then do that and it be a surprise.\"",
      "Wright-Phillips remarked: \"It just felt like to me that for whatever reason, the more people vouched for Kobbie, the more he refused. It's like he didn't wanna hear anybody.\"",
      "Mainoo is also well aware of what new boss Carrick thinks of him. The manager was questioned on Rio Ferdinand's podcast last year about whether he would construct United's squad around Mainoo, and his response was revealing.",
      "Carrick started Mainoo against City(Image: Getty)",
      "Carrick stated: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to. United's got to have an element of that.",
      "\"Always has done, always should, always have. To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that. You can say they get it. They know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has taken over Manchester United training(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "When Michael Carrick sat down with Manchester United's owners last week, he outlined his vision for what would help make the team succeed again.",
      "This didn't involve stating the obvious of winning matches. More a blueprint for what methods he thought would give United the best chance of winning games. Joel and Avi Glazer, along with Sir Jim Ratcliffe were said to be engrossed in the words which spilled from Carrick's lips.",
      "The executive meeting had been planned to take place in Monaco. But Carrick couldn't justify travelling to the south of France, when he had important work to do on the training pitch. He told his bosses he would be adopting a different approach to training and match preparation. That he was invested in quality more than quantity. How talking to each other and being honest, however brutal this might be at times, was just as valuable as having the ball at their feet on the training ground.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Club sources insist Ratcliffe was impressed with the \"calm and intelligent demeanour\" of his new interim manager.",
      "Carrick knew there would be a step-up in enthusiasm and energy from his squad following his return to the club. That a new, if familiar face to some, would give the group a lift.",
      "But he spoke with assistant Steve Holland before the first training session, to discuss the importance of taking full advantage of an improved mood.",
      "While in the background, Harry Maguire made it clear to his team-mates how United had re-hired someone with the club's principles running through his blood.",
      "Carrick has given Holland free reign to plan sessions and take them at Carrington. Gareth Southgate handed him the same responsibility during his time as England manager. It worked for him - and Carrick sees no reason why the same cannot happen for himself.",
      "While Carrick remains in charge and has the final say on team decisions, he is humble enough to bow to Holland's far greater coaching experience. Sessions are shorter and more intense. The players have been impressed with the attention to detail.",
      "Assistant Head Coach Steve Holland of Manchester United in action in training(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "While Carrick has encouraged the squad not to be in such a rush to leave the training ground when it's time to go home. He wants relationships to build and flourish. And he wants to be there to see which ones work, and which ones don't.",
      "He has spelled out how being a United employee, let alone a highly paid player, should always be regarded as one of the ultimate privileges in football.",
      "Carrick has made a point of speaking to certain individuals whose futures seemed uncertain. Kobbie Mainoo, Patrick Dorgu and Joshua Zirkzee have all been told to focus on United and the immediate future.",
      "Ahead of home games, United will now arrive at Old Trafford later than they did when Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim were in charge. Carrick wants his squad to get the best greeting possible, and to engage with supporters after matches as well. He also wants his players to spend less time hanging around before kick offs.",
      "Amorim would send his players home after matches without much feedback. But Carrick, following his first game in charge which saw United thump Manchester City at Old Trafford, has taken the opposite attitude.",
      "Win, lose or draw, no-one leaves the home dressing room without feeling appreciated. Carrick has also attended youth games. He knows his actions lead by example. And being prepared to do what some of those to go before him didn't (although Amorim did), outlines how invested he is in the project.",
      "Michael Carrick applauding after Manchester United's derby win in January 2026(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Carrick's return has coincided with United being engulfed in a relentless debate about the value and nature of the criticism aimed at them by pundits, most notably former players.",
      "It has turned toxic, but Carrick has refused to get involved, making it clear to his players and coaching staff that there are far more pressing - and important - problems to fix. And with no European football to focus on, Carrick knows he has more time than usual to come up with solutions.",
      "But even if he manages to get a positive result at Arsenal this weekend, his mantra will remain the same. One swallow does not make a summer.",
      "A summer by which time, he will have left no stone unturned in his quest to become United manager on a permanent basis.",

      "The scoreline could've been even more damning for City had it not been for three offside calls, two shots off the woodwork and Gianluigi Donnarumma's excellent performance in goal. The dominant win over their city rivals started Michael Carrick's interim tenure in the best way possible and now focus will turn to potential transfer dealings this month.",
      "The club have just the Premier League to focus on for the remainder of this campaign after falling at the first hurdle in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Prior to Ruben Amorim's sacking, there were little to no plans of any movement in the transfer window - but this could be subject to change.",

      "However, Boro have reportedly set a club record asking price of £30m and are reluctant to sell. With £225m spent on new signings last summer, including Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, United may look to offload some players before bringing in new faces.",
      "United may be planning to sell some unwanted stars before they bring in new talent to Carrick's squad. It is reported that outgoings are unlikely with the club keen to retain squad depth for the latter half of the season.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was heavily linked with an exit this month(Image: Neal Simpson/Sportsphoto/Allstar via Getty Images)",
      "Before Amorim's departure, Kobbie Mainoo had reportedly been open to a loan move out for more game time. The academy star had made just two starts for United this season before the side's 2-0 win over City and wanted more first-team football to boost his quality.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Mainoo's relationship with club chiefs is \"fragile\" with failed contract extension negotiations taking place in 2025.",
      "Napoli were rumoured to be the favourites to sign the midfielder but a swap deal with Palace could take place in order for United to secure Wharton's services this month.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is another forgotten star who could be on the way out in January. Since his arrival in 2024, the striker has managed just nine goals and nine assists.",

In the 29th edition of the Money League, the top 20 highest revenue generating football clubs for the 2024/25 season were revealed by the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
      "The respective clubs made collective history after generating a record £10.4billion (€12bn) in revenue for the first time. The mammoth figure marks an 11% figure in all three main revenue streams of commercial revenue, matchday revenue and broadcast revenue, which increased from last season.",
      "The top four spots were dominated by several of Europe's footballing superpowers with Real Madrid retaining their spot, having earned close to £1bn (€1.2bn). The Spanish giants were followed closely by Barcelona who generated £849million (€975m) with Bayern Munich rounding out the top three with £750m (€861m) earned.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are the lone Ligue 1 club on the entire list and rank fourth with last year's revenue tipping the scales at £729m (€837m). Next up are the reigning Premier League champions as Liverpool became the highest revenue generating English club for the first time as they earned £728m (€836m), following their historic title-winning campaign last year.",
      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The 2024/25 campaign proved to be a financially fruitful one for the Reds whose increased revenue was also bolstered by their return to the UEFA Champions League. The club also saw a 7% increase in commercial revenue thanks to additional non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "Music struck big at the iconic stadium with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Dua Lipa and Lana Del Rey all performing at Anfield.

      "Pep Guardiola's side suffered an unusually early Champions League exit as they were knocked out in the knockout phase play-offs, while finishing third domestically - their lowest position since the Spaniard's arrival a decade ago.",
      "Four Premier League clubs were ranked from seventh to 10th as Arsenal's earnings of £722m (€821m) left them closely behind. After United, it's Tottenham Hotspur who sit ninth as they generated £585m (€672m) despite a 17th-placed finish, but did end their 17-year trophy drought by winning the Europa League.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' impact was on display for Manchester United against Manchester City(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Manchester United are keen to enter contract discussions with Bruno Fernandes ahead of the World Cup. Earlier this season, the Red Devils captain revealed he was on the brink of a move to Saudi Arabian team Al-Hilal last summer.",
      "Although the transfer didn't materialise, United will be preparing for further interest in the former Sporting Lisbon star. Fernandes, 31, has expressed his desire to make decisions about his future once the World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico concludes.",
      "However, it seems United are eager to understand his intentions before the tournament kicks off in the summer, despite his previous comments. ESPN reports club officials are planning a pre-World Cup meeting with Fernandes to clarify his decision.",
      "His current contract with the club runs until the summer of 2027 and United have the option to extend his contract for an additional year, keeping him at Old Trafford until 2028. However, it's suggested they are content to let him decide his next steps.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Nevertheless, it's believed United would prefer him to stay at the club for at least another season. Against Manchester City, he demonstrated exactly why United do not want to let go of him.",
      "Michael Carrick's second stint as interim manager got off to a flying start with a resounding 2-0 victory over City in the Manchester Derby. Fernandes played a pivotal role in the win over Pep Guardiola's side, setting up Bryan Mbeumo's goal.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was pivotal against Manchester City(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "The board are keen for Fernandes to stay at Old Trafford to aid the transition to a new manager. Carrick has made a promising start, but it's unlikely he'll be given the role permanently.",
      "In December, Fernandes surprised club officials by telling journalists he believed United were ready to cash in on him. The midfielder suggested the club wanted to sell him, but didn't because then-manager Ruben Amorim wanted to keep him.",
      "Speaking to Portuguese TV station Canal 11, Fernandes said: \"The club wanted me to go [away]. I told the directors that, I don't think they had the courage to make that decision because the coach wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even though the coach wanted me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "Fernandes provided the perfect pass for Mbeumo to score the opening goal against City(Image: DARREN STAPLES, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "He added: \"I was valued, what values me most has to be my club, although I feel, lately, that I'm a little on the tightrope. In England a player reaches 30 and they think he has to remodel.",
      "\"The issue of loyalty is not as well-regarded as it used to be. I could have left in this market, I was going to earn a lot more money, a season ago I was going to leave, I was going to win many trophies this season.\"",
      "Fernandes has scored nine goals and provided five assists in 19 Premier League matches this season, and also set up a goal in United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton and Hove Albion.",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of this season(Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have confirmed Casemiro will leave the club when his contract expires this summer after a request from the Brazilian international.",
      "United made the decision a while ago that the 33-year-old’s contract wouldn’t be renewed or extended and informed Casemiro that was the situation.",
      "But with speculation over his future hitting overdrive in recent weeks, he asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation, according to a source. Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option.",
      "That has become an issue in recent days, with the player holding a clause in his contract that extends his deal by a year if he starts 35 games this season. To hit that clause, he would need to start every remaining fixture, but that won't be happening.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "By making his exit public five months before his contract expires at the end of June, it offers Casemiro and his team time to prepare for next season and plot his move for the 2026/27 campaign, although his focus will remain on United. He was outstanding in Saturday's derby day win against Manchester City.",
      "The decision not to offer the experienced midfielder a new deal is part of United's plans to overhaul the squad. Casemiro was signed for an initial £60million from Real Madrid in the summer of 2022, with add-ons taking that fee to £70million. He is also on around £300,000-a-week, a deal that rises to nearer £350,000-a-week if United are in the Champions League.",
      "Getting that salary off the wage bill will help United to fund plans to strengthen the squad this summer, with an overhaul of the midfield planned.",
      "Casemiro, who has 21 goals in 146 games for United so far, said: “I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life.",
      "“From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "“It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",
      "“We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.”",

      "However, United haven't opted to add just yet, though there is still 10 days for the Reds to change that. Despite their inactivity in the transfer window, Michael Carrick's side continue to be linked with signing several players, with a central midfielder thought to be at the top of their shortlist.",

      "Man United are reportedly battling it out with Chelsea and Tottenham for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Felix Nmecha.",
      "Sky Germany have claimed that the Premier League trio are expressing an interest. Nmecha's contract expires in 2018, but the Bundesliga side want to extend his stay sooner rather than later.",
      "Former Man United defender Paul Parker has told the club that getting rid of Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw has to be a priority in the years.",
      "“I think Maguire and Shaw are a symbol of what has gone wrong at Man United, and I can’t get my head around people thinking they are the solution. Both of them should have been offloaded a long time ago, but they are still here collecting their paycheques,” Parker said in an interview with MyBettingSites.",
      "“The fact that they are still here is a joke. Are they the worst players in the team? No, but they have been here for so long, taking up space in the squad and performing below what you expect from a Manchester United player.",
      "“Has it been impossible to get rid of them? It is definitely a possibility that they just like being part of Manchester United and earning a lot of money, but that tells me a lot about their ambitions.",
      "“If they had real ambition, they would move on to a club where they could make a difference. They can play at Manchester United, but they can’t make a difference.”",
      "Man United have reportedly registered an interest in West Ham's Mateus Fernandes, according to SportsBoom.",

      "Reports in Spain have claimed that Man United have launched a bid for Real Madrid star Federico Valverde.",
      "E-Noticies claim a club-record £104m bid has been put on the table and Valverde would be keen on the move. However, it's clear the move would only be feasible in the summer.",
      "Manchester United are interested in signing Micky van de Ven from Tottenham, according to TransferFeed. The Reds have tracked the Dutchman since his time at Wolfsburg.",
      "Liverpool are also interested, while Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are among the others keen on signing the centre-back.",
      "But in response to the interest, it's said that Tottenham have placed a stunning £100million price tag on Van de Ven's head.",
      "Reports this week from ESPN, suggest United are set to open talks with Fernandes over a new deal before the World Cup. In October, the captain seemed determined to stay at Old Trafford for as long as possible. Two months later, that position was thrown into doubt when in an interview back in Portugal, he suggested he did not feel wanted and outlined a number of opportunities he would like to pursue before retiring.",
      "Amorim said Fernandes had informed the club about the interview and things were smoothed over. However, last summer when the captain was weighing up a move to the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes explained it was Amorim who convinced him to stay. With the Portuguese head coach no longer at the club, it will be interesting to see how these talks transpire.",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United are expected to intensify their interest in Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson IF they miss out on Adam Wharton to Liverpool or Tottenham.",
      "United are expected to rival Manchester City for Anderson, who has been excellent since joining Forest from Newcastle in 2024. He is even set to be England's starting No.6 for the World Cup in the summer.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday spoke highly of United in the summer after they agreed to waive a fee to allow Harry Amass to join the Championship club on loan. This was due to the Owls' poor financial position under previous owner Dejphon Chansiri.",
      "Wednesday had hoped they could extend Amass' stay until the end of the campaign and their manager Henrik Pedersen was confident a deal could be done before last week's fixtures.",
      "However, the full-back is set to join Norwich City on loan for the remainder of the campaign which will be a blow for Wednesday. For United, the move to the Canaries makes more sense, particularly as Norwich will be involved in more competitive fixtures than the Owls between now and the end of the campaign.",

      "Aston Villa have expressed interest in Ruben Loftus-Cheek just days after he was reportedly 'offered' to United. The ex-Chelsea academy graduate has slipped down the hierarchy at AC Milan and could be loaned out as he aims to secure a place in the World Cup squad.",
      "Villa are seeking reinforcements following an injury to Boubacar Kamara, who is expected to miss the remainder of the season. According to The Athletic, Unai Emery's team could look to secure a midfielder on loan, with Loftus-Cheek among the candidates being considered.",
      "The Midlands club have already been unsuccessful in their pursuit of Conor Gallagher this month, with Tottenham presenting a permanent offer to Atletico Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was previously reported to have been proposed to United, and 'exploratory' discussions are said to have occurred.",
      "Manchester United is considered as a 'potential destination' for Borussia Dortmund forward Felix Nmecha, according to Sport Bild. The 25-year-old hasn't kicked on as much as he would have hoped at Dortmund and has scored just five goals in 28 appearances this season.",
      "Despite this, Dortmund have no interest in letting the player leave the club before the end of the transfer window. Nmecha has two-and-a-half years left on his contract at the Bundesliga club.",
      "As things stand, United are sticking to their guns when it comes to bringing in players before the February 2 deadline.",
      "It was the case before Amorim was sacked and it is the case now Carrick is in interim charge, that there is a reluctance to sign players in January as the long-term plan is to invest in the summer.",
      "However, United were willing to go back on that stance had they won the race for Semenyo. The money was there for the Ghana international but in the end he chose City.",

      "\"Jim Ratcliffe chose to get into bed with the Glazers and, in our opinion, is helping to keep them in charge. Twenty-one years of a debt mountain, mismanagement and financial greed is 21 years too long. Enough is enough,\" a The 1958 spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "\"So we protest not just against the Glazers, but now also against INEOS and Ratcliffe, a man once seen by many, including ourselves, as a possible saviour, a beacon of hope, but now revealed as complicit in the ongoing erosion of everything that makes our club what it is.",

      "The 29-year-old had been touted as a free agent target for United at the end of last season, but he instead moved abroad after his contract expired at Leicester and opted to sign for Besiktas instead.",

      "Sunderland are not open to a possible swap deal involving Manuel Ugarte and Noah Sadiki this month, according to The Mirror.",

      "Real Madrid are not interested in signing Ruben Neves this month, according to reports in Spain, per Sport Witness. It is claimed that Los Blancos president Florentino Perez is not keen on signing new players in January.",
      "Portuguese publication Record makes a similar assertion, indicating that Perez is hesitant to invest millions in Neves this month. The former Wolves midfielder's deal with Al Hilal runs out in the summer.",
      "This could create a clear pathway for Manchester United to make their approach. United are reportedly prepared to pay €20million (£17.4m) to secure his signature in January.",

      "There is an agreement in place between the two clubs and the transfer is expected to be completed in the next 24 hours.",

      "Tyrell Malacia could still leave Manchester United this month(Image: )",
      "Manchester United are yet to make a decision on whether Tyrell Malacia will be allowed to leave Old Trafford this month, with clubs in Europe interested in signing the left-back.",
      "Malacia was placed in the 'bomb squad' in the summer and made available for transfer, only to remain at the club for the first half of the season with no deal struck.",
      "The 26-year-old was reintegrated into the first-team squad in October and has made the bench for 13 of the last 15 games in all competitions, but he has been used only once when coming on as an 88th-minute substitute against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "It's been a frustrating year for the Netherlands international, who joined PSV Eindhoven on loan for the second half of last season but returned to his parent club after making 12 appearances, with just six starts.",
      "There has been interest in Malacia from clubs in Italy, Spain and Turkey this month, but it is understood there is no move imminent. The former Feyenoord defender has just five months remaining on his United contract and will be released at the end of the season if a deal isn't done this month, although he is keen to get more games under his belt.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He was the only one of five players placed in Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad' who didn't end up leaving Old Trafford in the summer. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all secured moves away, either permanently or on loan.",
      "Malacia played 45 minutes for United's Under-21s against Wolves earlier this month, scoring in a 4-1 win. He has proven his fitness since missing 517 days with two serious knee injuries.",
      "He made his comeback in an EFL Trophy game against Huddersfield in November 2024 and went on to make eight further appearances for United before his move to PSV last January.",
      "Malacia's place in the matchday squad could be in jeopardy, with Noussair Mazraoui set to return from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Morocco before Sunday's trip to Arsenal. Mazraoui offers full-back cover on the left and right, while Luke Shaw is the first-choice at left-back in Michael Carrick's back four.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can also play at left-back, although he played on the wing in the win against Manchester City last weekend. United also have the highly rated 18-year-old Diego Leon in their ranks.",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt is set to miss the trip to Arsenal this weekend(Image: Warren Little/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United travel to Arsenal this weekend, still glowing from the victory over Manchester City in the Premier League last weekend. Michael Carrick's return to the Old Trafford dugout could not have gone better as the Reds brushed aside City comfortably to keep in touch with the top four.",
      "Another tough challenge awaits United this weekend though, as the Reds make the trip down to London to face Mikel Arteta's team. The Gunners have not lost since the beginning of December and are full of confidence following their 3-1 victory over Inter in the Champions League on Tuesday night.",
      "Should United wish to pick up the three points on Sunday, they will have to do so without Matthijs de Ligt in the team. The Dutchman has not featured for the Reds since the 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace at the end of November. Initial thoughts were that the back injury was not going to be serious.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "In his first press conference, Carrick said: \"He has been carrying a bit of an issue, but hopefully, we'll get him back in some time soon. It's been a little bit slower than what they thought previously.\" In training on Wednesday, De Ligt was not spotted with his teammates.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee was also missing in training on Wednesday, having not made the squad for the City game last weekend either. The Dutchman is understood to have a small injury, which ensured he watched the derby from the stands last weekend. Zirkzee was captured telling a fan he would be out for two weeks.",
      "Like United, Arsenal's injury and absence issues appear to be easing. Cristhian Mosquera made a long-awaited return to the pitch for the Gunners in midweek against Inter in the Champions League. However, Max Dowman is expected to remain out for the game.",
      "Dowman is expected to make his return next month after suffering a problem to his foot. Piero Hincapie's groin injury, picked up against Liverpool earlier this month, should also keep him out of the clash with United.",
      "There is uncertainty as to when the centre-back will be in contention again, but there is a hope it will be before February. Finally, Arsenal are also set to be without Riccardo Calafiori.",
      "Arteta confirmed last week that the Italian would be out for a few weeks, but the exact timescale was unclear. A return before the United game does seem unlikely though.",

      "Manchester United could fall out of the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League next season, after plummeting to eighth in the latest report, their lowest-ever position in its 29-year history.",
      "The report takes into account United's miserable 2024/25 season, when they finished 14th in the Premier League and suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final. A total revenue of €793million for the season puts them below domestic rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Although there was an increase in matchday and commercial revenues, there was a substantial year-on-year fall in broadcast revenues and the trend is set to continue into next season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United will play just 20 matches at Old Trafford this season and have no European football at all, leading to fears their place in the top 10 in the established Deloitte report could be at risk.",
      "\"I think it’s reflective of the tough times that the club’s going through and there's a genuine fear that they could fall out of the top 10 next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe describes them as the world's leading football brand, but if the world's leading football brand is outside of the top 10 of revenue generators, then that's not very promising.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim steered United to the final of that competition in Bilbao, but even that didn't make up much of the shortfall to being outside of the Champions League at a time when a seat at Europe's top table is more financially rewarding than ever.",
      "\"With this new Swiss model, the Champions League is worth an absolute fortune,\" he said. \"And being in the second competition, you're probably getting around about a quarter of the money that you'd get.",
      "\"Even United getting to the final, they would have earned less money than the likes of City would have generated from being knocked out by Real Madrid in the play-off round.\"",
      "The value of Champions League football shows how important it is for United to secure a return to that competition this season after two successive years away.",
      "Last weekend's win against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge has put them back in fifth, which should be good enough to qualify, although the league table remains congested.",
      "If Carrick can steer United back to the Champions League and they enjoy a good season next year, then it should put them back on track financially as well.",
      "\"One successful season can do it,\" explained Maguire. \"Every match at Old Trafford in the Champions League is worth £8million or £9million in terms of ticket sales, so you've got a minimum of four matches.",
      "\"You get to the quarter-finals, you're probably looking at six or seven, so that's £60million. They'll pick up £70million or £80million in prize money as a minimum if you get that far. That’s £150million, then you get the extra £10million from Adidas and other sponsors will be kicking in as well, so that’s the thick end of an extra £200million and they bounce back to where you would expect them to be.",
      "\"Paradoxically, Manchester United fans, from a financial point of view, should want City and Liverpool to do well in the Champions League because that will cement that fifth place, which could be the difference as far as next season is concerned.\"",

      "Known as Toninho, Cruz confirmed his departure on LinkedIn, and he is the latest scout to leave Old Trafford as the club follows the modern trend of using data and AI to aid their recruitment and player watching.",
      "A former lower-league player in Portugal, Cruz is one of dozens of full-time scouts to leave United over the past 12 months, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's second round of redundancies including a slimming down of the scouting department.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "More than 80 full-time scouts were employed at that time, but swathes have been made redundant or moved on as director of recruitment Christopher Vivell seeks to overhaul what Ineos felt was an antiquated set-up.",
      "Writing on LinkedIn, Cruz said: “After 18 years at Manchester United as an International Scout, the time has come for me to close this important chapter of my career.",
      "“Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey.”",
      "Cruz joined United in 2007 and as well as scouting first-team players in Portugal and Spain, he would offer valuable insight into Portuguese opponents ahead of European fixtures. His biggest success story from a recruitment perspective is helping scout Bruno Fernandes, who joined the club six years ago.",

      "Mason Greenwood in action for Marseille during their 3-0 defeat to Liverpool(Image: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United eventually made the right call when deciding Mason Greenwood's future. A season-long loan move to Getafe only served the purpose of pushing the decision further down the line. When he returned to England, it was best for all parties to cut ties, and the winger was allowed to join Marseille.",
      "As part of that deal, United managed to insert some favourable clauses which will benefit them financially in the future. Should the Ligue 1 club sell Greenwood, they will owe a sizeable chunk of money to the Reds on any profit they make from the transfer.",
      "However, a chance has opened up for United to potentially make even more money should Greenwood be sold. According to Spanish media outlet AS, when United decided to sell Greenwood permanently and Getafe missed out on his signature, the La Liga club were given a 20 per cent clause which would become active on any profit the Reds make from Greenwood leaving Marseille.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "By all accounts, this is not a normal clause for a club who merely had the player on loan, to receive. But, from United's perspective, it seems they agreed this clause as a show of goodwill to Getafe considering they signed the forward when the Reds were staring at the impossible situation of keeping him.",
      "Now, it appears Getafe have put this 20 per cent clause on the market as they look to ease their current financial difficulties. For United, the decision should be clear - buy back the clause quickly.",
      "Some supporters still call for the return of Greenwood all these years later due to how well he has performed for Marseille since moving to France. The 24-year-old has scored 42 goals and bagged 12 assists in just 63 appearances for the French club and while he was kept quiet against Liverpool, interest is rising.",
      "There have been reports of clubs being willing to bite the bullet and sign Greenwood for some time, and willing to pay big money to do that too. Atletico Madrid have been linked with spending £87m on the Englishman which would land United with a healthy windfall.",
      "Eventually, a club, most likely outside of the Premier League, will agree a fee for Greenwood and United will be able to cash in. By purchasing Getafe's 20 per cent stake, the Reds will earn themselves an even greater share of the inevitable profit Marseille will make.",
      "Greenwood still has three and a half years left on his contract at Marseille and it is unlikely the French club will not look to cash in on the forward at some stage, especially if those sorts of figures are being brandished by teams. United are not going to be attempting to re-sign Greenwood, and nor should they, so why not open the door to reclaiming the Getafe clause.",
      "Were Greenwood to be sold for £87m, which is a possibility considering his form, Getafe's 20 per cent would be worth approximately £12m. If the Reds can purchase the clause for £5m, they will have done a good deal.",
      "The only thing they must be wary of is paying too much for the clause and overestimating the amount teams are going to pay for Greenwood. But, weighing it up, considering his age, his value will be at least £80m.",
      "The Greenwood saga is one which United would happily forget given the chance. But seen as that isn't possible, it makes financial sense to increase their share of Greenwood's sell-on clause before he is snapped up.",

Whether moves materialise this month under caretaker boss Michael Carrick or - more probably - when a permanent appointment is confirmed in the summer, the squad could be in line for more upheaval after last summer's outlay of more than £200million.",
      "It has been a relatively quiet January thus far, aside from Carrick taking charge following Ruben Amorim's departure. There have been no new signings on the playing front, though there has been one departure, with youngster Sam Mather moving to Turkish outfit Kayserispor.",
      "On the pitch, United are preparing to face Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday. They also host Fulham at Old Trafford on February 1, just one day before the winter transfer window closes.",
      "Even if United opt not to spend this month, there has been considerable speculation about potential summer activity. Here are our latest transfer lines.",

      "On Wednesday, reports surfaced suggesting Cole Palmer was homesick at Chelsea, with The Express talking up his suitability for United. Whilst it remains uncertain whether the two Premier League rivals could negotiate a summer deal, or whether they would even want to, former Blues star Marcel Desailly has seen reason for Palmer to move on from Stamford Bridge but doesn't think he should make the move immediately.",
      "Former France star Desailly shared his thoughts with Card Player, saying: \"I believe Palmer wants more stability and a system that's built for him, but he still needs to fully recover from his groin injury and get back to full fitness. His recent performances speak for themselves, so he needs to stay humble and come back into the team to help the club, regardless of whether he stays or goes.\"",
      "Marcel Desailly has offered advice to Cole Palmer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He added: \"The question is whether he feel like Chelsea are going to win the Premier League in the next two seasons. If he doesn't, I'm sure he will ask for a transfer request to a club that will build a system around him. For now, however, he needs to hit his previous levels for Chelsea to help them and their new manager through this period.\"",
      "According to Sky in Italy, Roma are preparing a formal offer for out-of-favour United star Joshua Zirkzee. Reports suggest the Italian side had been holding off until Bryan Mbeumo returned from the Africa Cup of Nations to bump Zirkzee back down the pecking order before restarting discussions.",
      "Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been linked with a move away from the club(Image: Richard Sellers/Allstar, Getty Images)",

The Netherlands international was absent from the weekend victory against Manchester City due to a minor knock, and has found consistent game time hard to come by this campaign.",
      "The Dutchman remains highly rated in Italy following his impressive displays that helped Bologna secure Champions League qualification in 2024. His performances under Thiago Motta convinced United to invest heavily, though the forward has struggled to find consistent form since netting a debut winner against Fulham.",
      "Juventus were also reportedly interested in the striker during Motta's tenure as their manager, but that speculation has since quietened. According to reports, Roma's preferred arrangement would be a loan deal with a conditional purchase option for the summer.",

      "The Beckhams are in the midst of a rift following Brooklyn's shocking statement, which detailed numerous issues he has with his family and expressed his unwillingness to reconcile.",
      "The situation was vastly different 23 years ago. David Beckham had just made his big move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the age of 28. Alongside Victoria, he was raising two young sons, Brooklyn and Romeo, who were four and one, respectively.",
      "It was the early days of the Beckham dynasty, which saw them become one of the most iconic families in the celebrity world. Despite enjoying some success in Madrid, Beckham faced immense pressure and didn't quite reach the lofty expectations set for him. He eventually moved to the LA Galaxy of the MLS.",
      "Former Real player Michel Salgado, who was tasked with \"babysitting\" Beckham during his time in Madrid, once shared an amusing anecdote about how the England star managed to annoy his wife.",
      "Salgado revealed on the League of Legends show: \"I was the one to babysit David Beckham. I did it a lot. It's because I was the only one to speak English.",
      "Beckham had a mixed time at Real Madrid(Image: Photo credit should read PHILIPPE DESMAZES/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"But it was great with Beckham. He was alone in Madrid because his wife was travelling a lot, living in LA and England. So he would call me every day, saying, 'Let's go out'. And my wife was really p***ed off with the situation, but it was a great time.\"",
      "Beckham wasn't the only player Salgado took under his wing. Former Liverpool winger Steve McManaman, who spent four years at the Spanish giants, also benefited from the ex-Blackburn Rovers defender's linguistic skills.",
      "\"I remember in my first day at Real Madrid pre-season,\" recalled Salgado. \"At that time, we were sharing rooms and they said, 'You're sharing with the English guy, Steven McManaman'.",
      "\"So I was like 'Oh my god, why'. They said, 'Because you're the only one who speaks English'. But in the end, it was great. I was the one to babysit the English guys.\"",
      "Michel Salgado was Beckham's 'babysitter'(Image: Photo credit should read CRISTINA QUICLER/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Struggling with boredom in the Spanish capital wasn't Beckham's only challenge. In his Netflix documentary 'Beckham', he reflected on his turbulent relationship with manager Fabio Capello.",
      "\"He was like a tough, strict manager, which I loved. He made me nervous and I don't get nervous,\" he said.",
      "He went on to describe a difficult period when Capello began regularly leaving him out of the starting XI: \"He benched both of us [along with Brazilian Ronaldo]. It killed me. At that point I wasn't sure of my future at Real Madrid.\"",
      "That uncertainty led to speculation linking Beckham with a move to LA. He recalled: \"On Monday morning, Capello called me into his office and said, 'I heard you're talking to other clubs, you will never play for Real Madrid again'. Obviously at that point I was very upset.\"",

      "Oliver Glasner launched a stunning attack on his Crystal Palace bosses as he prepares to leave Selhurst Park(Image: )",
      "Having just got rid of one combustible head coach who rarely sticks to the script in public, Manchester United won't be rushing to appoint another. That's why Oliver Glasner's remarkable rant against his Crystal Palace bosses after defeat at Sunderland on Saturday was such a risk.",
      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.",
      "\"I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once. Now it happens twice in six or seven months. That's just where we are now.\"",
      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have sold Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January(Image: )",
      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Manchester United travel to Arsenal on Sunday looking to continue their good performance vs Manchester City(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may as well have been lauded as a tactical genius after Manchester United produced a performance which shocked the Premier League to beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. On another day, had it not been for marginal offsides and some incredible reflex stops by Gianluigi Donnarumma, it could have been more.",
      "But United fans are not greedy, particularly after a performance that inspiring, and the hope is there that they can continue this form as they push for a spot in the top four. The game plan Carrick implemented against City was not expected considering how he liked his Middlesbrough team to dominate the ball in the Championship.",
      "However, he was pragmatic and had confidence his defence could keep out City's threats and hit them on the counter attack. This tactic worked to perfection. Senne Lammens made one ill-advised save for a shot that was going well off target but otherwise, had nothing to do.",
      "Meanwhile, at the other end, the Reds had ten shots, seven of which were on target. It was a case of quality over quantity and all of this came from just 32 per cent possession. The beauty of Carrick's game plan was how positive it was without the need to dominate the ball.",
      "United were patient, picked their moments and deserved the victory. While this game plan will need changing for matches against teams who the Reds, on paper, should be dominant over, they can copy and paste it for the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At Nottingham Forest this weekend, Arsenal had 60 per cent possession and tried their best to break down their opponents only to settle for a point. United sitting deep and then playing with pace on the break is arguably their best chance of stopping the runaway leaders.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be mindful of this but it is one thing knowing what is about to come, and another thing stopping it. However, what United need to be wary of, which they did not have to concern themselves with against City, is the Gunners' threat from set pieces.",
      "All the way back on the opening day of the season, United managed to hold their own against the north London club only to be caught out by a corner. There were suspicions of a foul which were waved away but Altay Bayindir was not strong enough and the goal was a poor one to concede.",
      "Last season, United were atrocious when it came to defending set pieces but they have managed to make some progress in the 2025/26 season. Lammens seems more commanding in the area and as a result, goals being conceded in this manner have dropped.",
      "But Arsenal are the specialists and you would expect this week, Carrick will be drilling in the importance of being alert at all times and how each set piece routine is a huge threat. The Gunners have the best squad in the Premier League and they are also a more physical side to most.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are wrecking balls at corners and United need to stand up and be counted. That is why you would expect Harry Maguire to start thanks to his aerial abilities.",
      "United have been accused of having a soft underbelly in the past but if they can replicate what they did against City at the Emirates Stadium, they will banish those criticisms.",

      "Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee has suffered a small injury. Zirkzee was absent from the squad to face Manchester City on Saturday afternoon due to the knock he picked up against Brighton.",
      "The Dutchman watched from the directors' box at Old Trafford as his team-mates secured a dominant 2-0 victory, which handed Michael Carrick a dream start to his interim role.",
      "United limited City to one shot on target and had three goals disallowed due to offside to seal the most impressive Manchester derby victory since the stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "When Patrick Dorgu scored with 14 minutes remaining, Zirkzee was pictured celebrating in the directors' box alongside Matthijs de Ligt, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson and Shea Lacey.",
      "United sources have confirmed Zirkzee's absence was due to a knock he suffered against Brighton. The 24-year-old was captured telling a fan outside Old Trafford that he would be sidelined for \"two weeks\", and it remains to be seen whether the issue affects his future in the final two weeks of the January window.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Zirkzee was unhappy with his game time during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Amorim viewed him as an important squad member.",
      "Zirkzee has considered leaving United for the sake of minutes in January, and Italian club Roma have expressed an interest in signing him on loan for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "When asked about Roma's interest in Zirkzee, he responded: \"Man Utd said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago and they have not changed their minds.”",
      "The winter window closes on February 2, meaning Zirkzee should recover from his knock in time to leave United before the deadline, provided he is given the green light to depart, which is not guaranteed.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is making a similar impact to Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "The debate over Manchester United's best signing since the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era is a short one. Bruno Fernandes stands head and shoulders above the rest in just about every category imaginable.",
      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "Incredibly, after one of the most impressive Manchester United performances in some time, the main sub-plot coming out of the Manchester derby is a rift between Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Lisandro Martinez. In the build-up to the derby, the former United midfielders gave a scathing critique of the Argentine on their podcast - The Good, The Bad and The Football.",
      "\"Martinez against [Erling] Haaland,\" Scholes said before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” The legendary midfielder added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "It was an outburst which raised eyebrows among the United fanbase as their comments went beyond normal punditry criticism, towards, at best, immature teasing of a professional footballer. Fittingly, Martinez started and impressed at Old Trafford on Saturday as he helped keep the Norwegian quiet, including producing a timely block to stop the striker.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With a 2-0 victory under their belt, it seemed the matter had been put to rest until the Argentine spoke in the mixed zone afterwards. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Scholes was quick to respond. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar please Lisandro Martinez.\" For now, that is where the back and forth ends but the whole saga has threatened to overshadow what was a brilliant victory in Michael Carrick's return fixture.",
      "Martinez had every right to respond to Scholes after the victory over City and that result obviously empowered him to speak out. Scholes is also no stranger to ruffling a few feathers with his takes.",
      "Back in December, he branded Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo as 'b*******' while Butt and Scholes agreed they would advise him to leave United if he to asked their opinion. Pundits should never be mere mouthpieces for the clubs they used to play for.",
      "But some pundits and ex United players are not holding back. Gary Neville was cited by Amorim over claims his criticism was influencing the club's decision makers while Roy Keane was scathing about the appointment of Jonny Evans to the backroom staff and took a pot-shot at Carrick's wife on the Stick to Football podcast after a social media spat during the midfielder's playing days.",
      "In an age where outrage sells, especially on social media, it is unsurprising to see punditry comments become a bit clos to the bone. Martinez and other United players should also be encouraged to respond to it, if they see fit.",
      "But, Martinez and his teammates are only in their right to respond if they are happy to hold their hands up when things are not going as well. It is telling when United win a match, social media is awash with posts from the squad celebrating and thanking the fans.",
      "Yet, when they lose, apologies are few and far between. Perhaps this is partly down to PRs advising their clients to keep quiet but it does come across as disingenuous to seemingly only comment after a win.",
      "Now that both men have had their say, it is time for a line to be drawn underneath this saga and for Martinez to continue doing his talking on the pitch. If he continues to perform well, the critics will have little reason to speak out.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro has confirmed he will leave the club when his contract expires at the end of the season.",
      "There is an option to extend Casemiro’s deal until 2027, but the Brazilian legend confirmed on Thursday that he will depart as a free agent this summer.",
      "Casemiro wrote on X:",
      "“Knowing when stages come to an end.",

      "“Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal.",

      "“Forever Red Devil.”",
      "Casemiro certainly won’t be remembered as a Manchester United legend, but he will be remembered fondly after looking amazing, then finished, then beyond finished, then competent, and finally good again.",
      "Signed from Real Madrid for over £60million in August 2022, Casemiro penned a four-year contract, with the option of an additional year, worth more than £300,000 per week.",
      "At the time, the Erik ten Hag signing was viewed as a solid one. Casemiro had established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world at Madrid, where he won five Champions League titles.",
      "However, signing a 30-year-old for such a monumental fee, on such high wages, for a minimum of four years, was always a financial risk and not a particularly wise one.",
      "Casemiro’s instant impact meant those concerns were quickly forgotten, until his form dropped off dramatically and United were reportedly desperate to offload both him and his monstrous salary.",
      "His 2022/23 campaign was outstanding, helping the Red Devils win the Carabao Cup and finish third in the Premier League. But what followed in 2023/24 was an absolutely shocking season.",

      "“I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move.”",
      "It wasn’t a wild take. Yet Casemiro somehow bounced back the following season and became one of the few Manchester United success stories during Ruben Amorim’s reign as head coach.",
      "The Real Madrid legend thrived in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has remained a key player since Michael Carrick took charge for the remainder of his United career.",
      "With just over four months left at Old Trafford, Casemiro has no silverware left to play for but will hope to help guide the club back into the Champions League.",
      "There are no concrete reports linking Casemiro with a specific summer move, but a switch to Saudi Arabia makes the most sense.",
      "The 33-year-old has been relentlessly linked with Saudi Pro League clubs for more than two years, with Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly keen on reuniting with his former Real Madrid team-mate at Al-Nassr.",

The Saudi Arabian club is poised to make history and turn Bruno Fernandes into one of the highest-paid footballers of all time. The offer being prepared in Riyadh surpasses any known standard, both in salary and media impact.",

For the Portuguese player, the offer would be virtually impossible to refuse from a financial standpoint, placing him among a select few footballers in history.’",
      "It is also said that the final decision regarding Fernandes hinges on three ‘factors’; ‘the sporting project presented by Manchester United, Bayern Munich’s ability to entice him with their competitive offerings, and, above all, the size of the Saudi Arabian offer’.",

Without Fernandes, United suddenly get a lot worse but also far less interesting. They will need a replacement ready to come in and light up Old Trafford and Palmer is one of very few we would fancy to thrive in that spotlight.",
      "That being true, why would Chelsea sell?",
      "Because Chelsea are Chelsea. They chase trades as hard as trophies. Arguably, football is the side hustle to Clearlake’s investment portfolio.",

      "Selling Palmer might spare the new manager a tricky decision. Because Chelsea can cope without Palmer far better than United without Fernandes.",
      "Does Palmer even get in Rosenior’s best team right now? Ludicrous question though it may seem, in the new manager’s preferred shape, there is room for only one attacking midfielder ahead of a double-pivot. Which pits Palmer against Enzo Fernandes for the no.10 position.",
      "Palmer has played off the right flank for Chelsea but, unquestionably, he is best used centrally. The same is true, though, of the Blues’ £107million Argentinian investment. And Rosenior is unlikely to grant Palmer the freedom to roam off the right that Mauricio Pochettino afforded him in 2023/24.",
      "Not only could United offer Palmer his Manchester home comforts – assuming that is as relevant as some are suggesting – but if Fernandes is not long for Old Trafford, the no.10 position would be his.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there. But could someone else still beat Frank to the finish? Oliver Glasner and, even more interestingly, Pep Guardiola are now very much involved in the conversation.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, it’s now six points from their last four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley in what is fast becoming the world’s least convincing unbeaten run ever.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but still five points away despite West Ham collecting the inevitable from a trip to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take further signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "After the latest check on the pulse of the nation with regard to Mason Greenwood’s return to Manchester United, we can confirm that people remain grimly fascinated by the possibility and that it’s still really not OK.",
      "It’s an uncomfortable truth that football journalists are now all too aware of that Greenwood is a name which does good business. In part because he’s an excellent footballer who looks destined for great(er) things, but also because of the manner of his exit from Old Trafford and how his possible return continues to split opinion.",
      "Greenwood faced charges for rape and assault in October 2022 but the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the case against him four months later after the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction. He was not – as Greenwood said in a statement afterwards – “cleared” of the charges. We all heard the audio.",
      "Manchester United tested the waters. They gave inside scoops detailing his reintegration into the squad and were met with disgust from fans and (some) members of the media.",
      "In a lengthy statement, Female Fans Against Greenwood’s Return said the possible return of Greenwood “tells us, as women, that we don’t matter”.",
      "It added: “It tells us that men who make the club money matter; not us, our fellow fans, mothers, sisters or daughters.”",
      "To avoid a PR disaster, Greenwood was sent to Getafe on a season-long loan, before – after further suggestions that he may return to Man Utd were shot down – he was sold to Marseille for £26m in the summer of 2024.",
      "And now 42 goals in 63 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, links to Barcelona and Premier League alternatives, and sell-on and buy-back clauses combine to make his future a particularly intriguing prospect for click-hungry websites. We’re aware that we’re having and eating cake.",
      "Thursday morning saw multiple old Greenwood articles re-nosed for publication. What’s ‘Tuchel’s stance on an England recall’? Still a hard no. We particularly enjoyed Jurgen Klopp ‘making his feelings clear on Greenwood’ as one outlet looked to crowbar two of the most Google-able names into the same headline.",
      "The flurry was no coincidence. Editors will have been on at their minions to push Greenwood on the back of him facing Liverpool for Marseille last night, sensing an opportunity for traffic with him front of mind for more English fans than usual. They will have been praying for a goal or two from the 24-year-old to provide a further boost.",
      "One report claims ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club’. Who says? ‘Sources’ do. Could be groundsman No. 5 or – because it’s not ‘club sources’, just ‘sources’ – literally anyone. I’m a source, you’re a source.",
      "That’s preferential on a moral level than if the ‘news’ has come from inside Manchester United, as that would suggest that they are again looking to gauge public opinion over his possible return. Newsflash guys: it’s never going to change.",
      "People who believe he deserves a second chance and that everyone makes mistakes, who sign up to the view that ‘she’s OK with it so why aren’t you?’ left their morals at the door long ago and aren’t about to recover them.",
      "Those of us who see the preservation of his career as a stain on football and want the verified social media accounts championing him to get in the bin aren’t about to forgive and forget on the basis of him scoring quite a lot of goals.",
      "Just to be clear: It will never be okay for Manchester United to re-sign Mason Greenwood.",

      "There are a couple of league tables that feel pretty significant this morning.",
      "The first is a Champions League table that has five Premier League teams camped inside the all-important top eight, and a non-zero chance that after the matchday-eight madness that number is actually six.",
      "And then there’s the newly published Deloitte Football Money League that has every member of the Premier League’s Big Six inside its top 10, with only the continental behemoths of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain ahead.",
      "Perhaps more striking still is that three more Premier League sides – Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham – all make the top 20. And it only gets more absurd the further down the list you go; half the top 30 are Premier League teams. Brentford had higher revenues in 24/25 than any South American club.",
      "It’s a reminder, along with the recent domestic struggles of your Tottenhams and Manchester Uniteds in an increasingly competitive division, of just how huge the Premier League’s baked-in advantage over the rest of Europe and therefore the world now is.",
      "There is no other country that could even conceive of having six teams cruising through the Champions League league stage as the English clubs have this season. A quick look at the worst-performing team from the other big leagues – none of whom, of course, have as many as six entrants to begin with – is stark.",
      "Villarreal sit second bottom with just a point to their name after seven games. Eintracht Frankfurt have fared little better and are also out of contention altogether before the final matchday of a league format specifically and deliberately designed to minimise jeopardy. Napoli currently sit outside the top 24.",
      "And even above them, any or all of Marseille, Leverkusen, Monaco and Athletic Club could yet tumble and miss even the play-off safety net.",
      "England’s worst-performing team is Manchester City, who even in the absolute worst-case scenario can now finish no lower than 18th.",
      "And this at a time when five of the Big Six would consider themselves to be, in general, underperforming this season. Even not in peak condition, these six teams remain among the very best in the Champions League, their superiority baked in yet further by the added advantage of being kept apart from each other throughout the league phase. Five Champions League places already feels inevitable for next season.",
      "Tottenham are the 14th best team in England but the fifth best in the entire continent. You’re tempted to say ‘make it make sense’ but it’s actually pretty depressingly easy to make it make sense. The bloated Champions League league stage is a lower overall standard than the Premier League.",
      "The only real surprise in Spurs’ lofty standing is the fact three Premier League teams sit below them.",
      "You could chuck plenty more Premier League teams into the Champions League and they would most likely also finish in the top 24 qualifying positions.",
      "Aston Villa and Manchester United most obviously, but really anyone currently above Spurs in the table has proof of concept.",
      "There are other factors of course. There’s little doubt that Spurs specifically are playing with far greater freedom with the pressure off to an extent in a Champions League where relatively little is expected of them and failure is legitimately hard to achieve; they are clearly less burdened and shackled by fear and tension on European nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where they haven’t lost any of their last 24 games, than on Premier League days.",
      "The fact Spurs have won as many Champions League games as Premier League games on their own patch since the start of 2025 is both hilarious and ridiculous, but also revealing.",
      "English clubs, in truth, underperformed in last season’s Champions League. Yet they still produced a semi-finalist, a quarter-finalist and a team that dominated the league stage only to find themselves unfortunate to come up against what was by the time of the first knockout round the best team in the competition.",
      "And it still took members of the tiny handful of European powerhouses who can still vaguely compete with any of the Premier League big guns on an even keel to eliminate them: Real Madrid knocked out Man City, and PSG took care of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – notably finding each of them far harder nuts to crack than finalists Inter.",
      "And the three members of the Premier League’s Big Six who found themselves outside the Big Cup just casually dominated the lesser trophies, with Spurs beating Man United in the Europa League final and Chelsea winning the Conference League while yawning and absent-mindedly scratching their arse throughout.",
      "But the Deloitte numbers also show why, even now as it feels like it’s disintegrating on the Premier League pitch, it is still correct to talk about the Big Six. Spurs’ revenues still dwarf those of Villa and Newcastle, never mind supposed European giants like Atletico Madrid or Juve or the Milan clubs.",
      "The fact Villa’s wage bill is significantly higher than Tottenham’s – and terrifyingly close to Manchester United’s – is a sign of a problem approaching rapidly over the hill for the midlands club rather than evidence they have compellingly displaced silly Spurs.",
      "And here too another reminder that while Villa’s frustration and anger at what they perceive as rules designed to protect that Big Six and force them to operate with one hand behind their back is understandable, their direction for that irritation is entirely misplaced.",
      "Villa should not look at Spurs and think ‘unfair’. They should look at Spurs as the example to follow. Not on the pitch, obviously. Don’t do that, whatever you do. But off the pitch.",
      "For all their myriad faults, their undeniable and unending banter-club status, the one thing Spurs have got impressively right over the last two decades is making that elite cabal a Big Six in the first place, and how they went about it. Say what you like about Spurs – and we do, frequently – but they did not bet the house on shortcutting their way in as Villa are currently attempting or follow Newcastle’s own dubious attempt at the Man City or Chelsea approach.",
      "And that’s why even now, as Spurs reel around on the fringes of a genuine relegation fight and Villa have at this time thoroughly and conspicuously overtaken them on the pitch, those Deloitte numbers and Champions League table still tell a tale of how and why the idea of the Big Six persists and prevails."

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage reaching the Christmas break, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results across all three competitions.",
      "All six of England’s Champions League representatives are now assured of play-off spots at worst. Arsenal will definitely finish in the top eight and go straight to the last 16, while it’s not inconceivable that all of the other five could do so. Remember, there are bonus points on offer based on your finishing positions and last-16 participation, so that will all help boost the pot.",
      "Villa and Forest are in good shape in the Europa League, while Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "Total points: 125.375\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nPlay-off round: Crystal Palace (UECL)\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL)",
      "",
      "Yes, it’s a surprise name currently in second place until you scratch the surface. First, with only four teams in European competition every individual win is worth half a point. Add in the fact that all four of Poland’s teams are in the Conference, where the league stage is over and the bonus points for finishing positions dished out, and it all starts to make sense.",
      "Will obviously fall off as the stagger unwinds, but they will still be picking up points here and there for a while yet.",
      "Total points: 54.500\nTotal teams: Four\nTeams still active: Three\nLast 16: Rakow Częstochowa (UECL)\nPlay-off round: Lech Poznan, Jagiellonia Bialystok (both UECL)\nEliminated: Legia Warsaw (UECL)",

But the big three will all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night teams.",
      "To no great surprise, it looks like Spain in a scrap with Italy and Germany to pick up an extra spot alongside England.",

That’s because according to some reports, Palmer hasn’t properly settled into life down south and could look to move closer to his Manchester home.",

      "He told them he was ‘invested in quality more than quantity’ in training and match preparation, insisting ‘being honest was just as valuable as having the ball at their feet on the training ground’. Club sources claim Ratcliffe was impressed with his “calm and intelligent demeanour” in those discussions.",
      "Recognising there would likely be a ‘step-up in enthusiasm and energy’ upon his arrival – a new-manager bounce – Carrick spoke to Steve Holland ahead of the first training session to ensure they ‘took full advantage of an improved mood’ before handing the assistant coach ‘free reign to plan and take sessions at Carrington’.",
      "According to the report, ‘the players have been impressed with the attention to detail’ in what have been ‘shorter and more intense’ sessions than they were used to under Amorim.",
      "Meanwhile, Maguire was enlisted to ‘make it clear to his teammates how United had re-hired someone with the club’s principles running through his blood’.",
      "Carrick has also encouraged the squad not to rush home after games as he ‘wants relationships to build and flourish’ and so that he can ‘see which ones work and which ones don’t’, while taking the time to speak to individual players, particularly those who feel they’re on the fringes of the squad.",
      "He’s also taking ‘the opposite attitude’ to Amorim when it comes to feedback. While the Portuguese boss would often send players home after games without talking to them, Carrick insists on ‘no-one leaving the home dressing room without feeling appreciated’.",
      "United will arrive for games later than they did under Amorim to avoid them ‘hanging around before kick-off’ and to ensure ‘his squad get the best greeting possible’ from the fans.",
      "The last week, while hugely positive in general for United, has also seen some toxic punditry – if we can even call it that – from Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt make headlines.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Tottenham Hotspur are acutely aware of interest from Liverpool and Manchester United in centre-back Micky van de Ven, and they have responded by slapping a huge price tag on his head.",
      "We have previously revealed that Spurs’ ambition is to tie Van de Ven down to a new long-term deal, which would see his salary doubled so he would earn similar terms to the club’s highest earners: Conor Gallagher and Cristian Romero.",
      "We reported how Tottenham’s CEO, Vinai Venkatesham, opened initial talks with the Dutch international’s camp over the summer. He views a new deal for the defender as a top priority.",
      "However, Spurs are also aware that given their current struggles, there is little chance of persuading van de Ven to sign, so those talks are not progressing at any sort of pace.",
      "Sources indicate that Liverpool are fully aware of Van de Ven’s situation at Tottenham and very much like the 24-year-old as a long‑term defensive solution.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, are keeping pace, having tracked the centre-back since his Wolfsburg days and viewing him as an ideal profile for their rebuild.",
      "Both clubs admire his blend of recovery pace, composure, and left‑sided balance – attributes that are increasingly rare and, as it turns out, extremely expensive.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Given the interest gathering around Van de Ven, we understand from sources with knowledge of the situation that Tottenham have slapped the £100million price tag on him.",
      "Should Van de Ven leave for £100million, he would become the most expensive defender in football history, surpassing the £80million United spent on Harry Maguire in 2019.",
      "Sources suggest Spurs are fully aware that such a valuation will deter most suitors, but with their season faltering and uncertainty creeping in, they know they cannot afford to look weak in the market.",
      "Tottenham remain hopeful they tie Van de Ven down to an even bigger, long‑term contract, rewarding him for his rapid rise and cementing him as a cornerstone of their future.",
      "But given the club’s current trajectory, insiders admit there is little chance the Dutchman will commit to fresh terms.",
      "That leaves Spurs in a precarious position: a prized asset attracting heavyweight attention, a player reluctant to extend, and a valuation designed to keep the vultures at bay – at least for now.",
      "Liverpool and United will continue to monitor the situation closely, but so will others and we are told Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are fully aware of the situation, too.",
      "Meanwhile, my colleague, Dean Jones, has reported that Tottenham are still planning to make a ‘major’ signing before this month’s transfer window closes – and they are focusing on bringing in a new winger.",
      "With Yan Diomande unavailable and Antoine Semenyo joining Manchester City, they have switched their attention to West Ham star Crysencio Summerville.",
      "In other news, manager Thomas Frank remains under intense scrutiny, despite Spurs’ 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.",
      "Behind the scenes, the club’s hierarchy are doing their due diligence on potential replacements. However, reports suggest that former United manager Ruben Amorim, who has been linked with the role, is not an option for Spurs.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘in talks’ over re-signing Mason Greenwood, while an update has emerged regarding Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Greenwood progressed through the ranks at Man Utd and was expected to be a key player for his boyhood club for most of his career.",
      "However, Man Utd had no choice but to offload Greenwood after he faced charges relating to attempted rape and assault.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service eventually discontinued the case against Greenwood as the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction.",
      "Man Utd also conducted an internal investigation into the matter and they faced a PR disaster by keeping Greenwood, who was sent on loan to La Liga side Getafe in the 2023 summer transfer window.",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Man Utd pair storm into top three",
      "Greenwood impressed on the pitch for Getafe and joined Marseille in the 2024 summer transfer window for around £26m.",
      "Man Utd sold Greenwood below his market value, but they have a couple of clauses in their favour, including a 50% sell-on clause and a potential buy-back clause.",
      "The 24-year-old has 42 goals and 12 assists in his 63 appearances for Marseille over the past 18 months and has been heavily linked with moves elsewhere, with Barcelona and Atletico Madrid among those linked with him.",
      "These possibilities would benefit Man Utd financially as they would stand to receive an extra £25m+ with their sell-on clause, but a new report from Football Insider claims they are ‘in talks’ over ‘bringing Greenwood back’ to the club.",
      "Man Utd chiefs should hang their heads in shame if there is any truth to this report and it would still be a PR nightmare if they or another English side sanctions his return to the Premier League.",
      "The report from Football Insider adds: ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club, sources have told Football Insider.",
      "‘The Red Devils included a buy-back clause when they sold the 24-year-old right winger to Marseille in the summer of 2024, where they can sign the attacker for a knockdown fee less than his worth in the current market.’",
      "This deal is surely unlikely, but Man Utd are far more likely to sign at least two midfielders in the summer and could sell captain Bruno Fernandes to raise funds for these moves.",
      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a potential move to the Saudi Pro League over the past year, but a new report from ESPN claims the Red Devils are keen for him to remain at the club beyond this season.",
      "The report explains: ‘Manchester United are planning talks with captain Bruno Fernandes about his future ahead of the World Cup with club bosses poised to tell the midfielder they want to keep him at Old Trafford for at least one more year, sources have told ESPN.",
      "‘Fernandes came close to joining Al Hilal last summer and there is expected to be more interest in the Portugal international at the end of the current campaign. However, the club’s preference is to keep their captain in what will be another transitional summer with a new permanent manager set to arrive to replace Ruben Amorim.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’.",
      "Chelsea fans won’t like it, but selling Cole Palmer to Man Utd might make sense for Clearlake and co with the England star one of few fit to replace Bruno ...",
      "We can confirm that people remain grimly fascinated by Mason Greenwood’s possible return to Manchester United and that it’s still not OK.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has shut down a fellow pundit’s claim about Michael Carrick following the win against Manchester City.",
      "Man Utd legend Gary Neville picked out Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo out for special praise as the Red Devils beat Man City 2-0 on Saturday.",
      "Man Utd are ‘growing increasingly confident’ that they will sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton over the summer as Bruno Fernandes’ transfer plan is revealed."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that an “internal meeting” at Man Utd is planned for “this week” regarding transfers.",
      "“There will be an internal meeting at Manchester United at the beginning of this week involving Michael Carrick,” Romano said.",
      "“Carrick does not make the final decisions, but he will be involved in discussions after a very strong start, including winning the Manchester derby. United will decide whether to pursue an opportunity in January, possibly in midfield or attack, or to keep the current squad until the summer.",
      "“At the moment everything is very quiet and the big investments are expected in the summer with a permanent manager in place. In Italy, clubs like Roma and Juventus are waiting to see if United open the door for players such as Joshua Zirkzee, but for now United have not decided.”",
      "READ: Ranking the 20 biggest PL summer transfers as Man Utd pair storm into top three",
      "As Romano mentions, several exits have been mooted to raise funds, but Ruben Amorim’s departure and Carrick’s arrival have changed the situation regarding Kobbie Mainoo, who is not set to remain at the club.",

      "Regarding possible incomings, Man Utd are linked with several targets, including Al-Hilal midfielder Neves.",
      "Neves retains a strong reputation after having a brilliant spell with Wolves in the Premier League and he could return to England this month.",
      "The 28-year-old is due to become a free agent in the summer, but Al-Hilal could let him leave this month so they get a fee for the centre-midfielder.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Man Utd have been given a free run at landing Neves as Real Madrid have ‘closed the door’ and ‘rejected’ the chance to sign him for a fee this month.",
      "Neves, meanwhile, ‘would accept a significant pay cut’ to seal a move to Man Utd, who are ‘accelerating’ for the signing.",
      "The report claims: ‘They have already submitted a formal offer. The proposal is around 20 million pounds, just under 23 million euros. A significant sum considering the player’s contract expires in six months.",
      "‘At Old Trafford, they see it as a market opportunity. They prefer to pay now and secure the signing rather than enter a summer bidding war. Furthermore, Rúben Neves himself would be willing to facilitate the transfer.’",
      "Man Utd have now made a final decision to keep Kobbie Mainoo at Old Trafford after getting “instant trust” from Michael Carrick, says Fabrizio Romano.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have lodged a ‘formal offer’ as they look to sign former Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal.",
      "Man Utd are still keeping their options open over a potential midfield signing in January with Ruben Neves still a possibility, according to reports.",
      "Transfer hijacks are really fun and we need some to save this January window. Here’s how Liverpool and Manchester United could be forced into action…",
      "Man Utd are reportedly keen on signing Ruben Neves, who is available for £20m in a transfer that has the potential to be the signing of the year.",
      "Man Utd are planning to sell captain Bruno Fernandes “and then use that money elsewhere” in the summer transfer window, according to a former scout."

      "While one Arsenal player forces his way to the top a couple of his teammates are drifting and Viktor Gyokeres is still terrible. Meanwhile Manchester United’s trio are all trending upwards.",
      "We’ve now got all 20 of the Premier League’s most expensive summer transfers in the ranking following Yoane Wissa’s long-awaited return to fitness.",
      "Here’s where the players ranked three games into the Premier League season and after nine and then 15, with their previous positions included in brackets.",
      "",
      "All of his personal gripes with Newcastle and their ‘broken promises’ considered, along with the injustice surrounding the imbalance of power between clubs and players with regard to contracts, we can’t help but feel quite pleased he’s having an absolute mare at Liverpool.",
      "Any hope that the floodgates might open after his first Premier League goal against West Ham – a fine finish it was too – faded dramatically with arguably even worse performances to strengthen claims that Isak might just be the biggest flop in Premier League history before yet another injury.",
      "Here’s to his speedy recovery as a) injuries are sh*t and b) watching Isak play football is now brilliant no matter how he performs. Back to his best? Great, he’s a wonderful striker. Still terrible? Flopping excellent.",
      "",
      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team, he was to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man.",
      "In over 1000 minutes he has no goals, just two assists, has spent half the time watching Jacob Murphy from the bench and has forced Eddie Howe into fielding one of his two left wingers in his position on the right.",
      "This graph from football analysis experts Gradient Sports tells you what you need to know…",
      "",
      "A more than cheeky £30m offer from Fenerbahce for Wissa, six months after his protracted £55m transfer from Brentford and just 477 minutes into his Newcastle career gives a pretty clear indication as to how they view his time thus far on Tyneside.",
      "Having missed the first four months of the season either sulking to force the transfer, injured, or both, he’s scored three goals since returning to action at the start of December – though he was excellent v PSV – currently making him flop adjacent; full status is in the post.",
      "",
      "The abiding memories of Sesko’s contribution to English football so far are him stepping up 10th in the penalty shootout defeat to Grimsby Town having put a stoppage-time chance over the bar from roughly four yards out to ensure the game went that far, and getting injured when clean through against Tottenham.",
      "A brace against Burnley to double his United goals tally offered promise that was quickly and fairly comprehensively extinguished when he didn’t make it off the bench in Michael Carrick’s first game in charge against Manchester City, which was also The Best Manchester United Performance Since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "",
      "We were concerned for a while that Arsenal fans were becoming indestructible such was the way they brushed off perfectly valid criticism of Gyokeres on their seemingly inexorable path to the Premier League title.",
      "But the quite remarkable return of pessimism despite a seven-point lead in the league and a 100 per cent record in the Champions League. has granted us access once more to poke at the brittle Gunners psyche and Gyokeres’ frankly shocking form is the standout pressure point.",
      "His fine finish against Inter on Tuesday was overdue as his only goal since November 1 in the Premier League came from the penalty spot against Everton. But Gabriel Jesus scored a brace in that game and with Kai Havertz still waiting in the wings Gyokeres will surely soon find himself out of the starting line-up in games that matter if he puts in insipid displays as he did against Nottingham Forest.",
      "",
      "He’s done some good things – a stunner against Wolves in the League Cup, a nice assist in defeat at Leeds – but still feels nailed on to be the next young forward to drown in stagnant pool of attacking talent that Stamford Bridge has become in the BlueCo era.",
      "He’s not started a Premier League game since the start of December and although looked decent in Liam Rosenior’s first game in charge against Charlton, won’t be at all encouraged by the new head coach starting Pedro Neto on the left against Arsenal or by Alejandro Garnacho coming off the bench to score a brace.",
      "",
      "He’s taken to Liverpool like a duck to a frozen pond, expecting to swim but landing arse up with his face in the ice.",
      "For a the first few weeks of the campaign he was playing as though he was constantly trying to make up for mistakes he hadn’t made yet but then duly did make in desperation to impress. He didn’t know where to be or what to do so tried to be everywhere doing everything, and was therefore usually nowhere, doing nothing.",
      "Arne Slot’s move to a style of football some would call functional and others would see as the most turgid sh*te they’ve witnessed at Anfield for many a moon has minimised the space allowed for mistakes, from Kerkez and any of the other culprits.",
      "But signed largely on the basis of his raiding attacking quality the shift has rather cut Kerkez off at the knees. He has one goal and no assists in 29 appearances in his debut season.",
      "",
      "Clearly a hugely talented footballer and the obvious suggestion is that he would thrive under a different, less conservative, more forward-thinking manager. We’re not quite so sure.",
      "The football happens all-too frequently around rather than through him and we could list a dozen high-profile playmakers who have arrived in the Premier League and left soon after for whom that was the case.",
      "",
      "A couple of goals off the bench against Arsenal followed by a nothing display against Brentford is Garnacho in a nutshell. The jury’s out and frankly we don’t expect them back in session for the rest of what looks to be a predictably frustrating season of infrequent highs from a base of lows.",
      "",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves was followed by a whole lot of guff from Reijnders, who’s shown glimpses of his quality and scored a few goals of late, but has done nothing like what we expected after that opening-day clinic.",
      "Large periods in games go by in which you forget he’s playing, which is quite the feat for a midfielder in a Pep Guardiola team.",
      "",
      "His first Arsenal goal being the winner against his former club and his next three all coming against the Gunners’ bitter north London rivals whom he was days even hours away from joining instead of them all adds to what was an already pretty clear sense that Eze’s return to his boyhood club was meant to be.",
      "But those were his only four goals and his failure to displace a horribly out-of-form Martin Odegaard from the Premier League starting XI doesn’t bode at all well for Eze’s short-term Arsenal future or for his World Cup chances. He’s featured for just 23 minutes across the last six Premier League games, failing to make it off the bench in four of them.",
      "",
      "We may may never have been more invested in an Arsenal signing doing well after the #NOTOMADUEKE petition but have also struggled with the thought of those unthinkable tw*ts lacking any sort of human decency being allowed to enjoy the football he’s playing.",
      "Here’s hoping they hung their heads in shame as his piledriver against Club Brugge cannoned in off the underside of the crossbar in recognition that they are wholly underserving of nice things. We fear the I Told You So-ists will soon be crawling from the woodwork with Madueke struggling for end product of late.",
      "",
      "Wirtz has dropped down the growing list of Liverpool problems Arne Slot has to deal with, not least because he appears to be relatively low maintenance in comparison to others (or An Other).",
      "It’s not clear whether a slight uptick in his performances is down to Wirtz’s slow adaptation to the Premier League or if a guy with that much talent is bound to show some quality if afforded enough time on the pitch. We suspect the latter but it doesn’t really matter.",
      "There has been notable improvement but he still needs to do a helluva lot more to ease doubts over his suitability to be the face of the New Liverpool in a post-Mohamed Salah era.",
      "Nothing is quite at the elite yet but it’s all looking decent…",
      "",
      "Genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack after two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games has since faded into questions as to whether the Brazilian would even be in a Blues XI looking to challenge for major honours in future after a further five goals and one assist in his last 18 top flight games.",
      "While Liam Delap has so far failed to prove he’s the answer as the furthest man forward, he looks more suited to that role than Pedro, who thrives in a more withdrawn position which is sure to be occupied by Cole Palmer assuming Pedro Neto or Estevao play on the right flank.",
      "He’s a fine footballer and has proven himself worthy of the step up from Brighton, but he’s not the top striker Chelsea needed and still need.",
      "",
      "We will forever have a soft spot for footballers who don’t look as though they should be good at football. Combine that with him being the cause of great mirth for naysayers in the summer having joined for a fee way above his market value as Newcastle’s fourth or fifth-choice striker and him having to replace £125m defector Isak and we were tucking into veritable jambalaya of joy at seeing Woltemade’s early goalscoring form at St James’ Park.",
      "But he’s failed to score in any of his last seven appearances and the brace against Chelsea just before Christmas were his only goals in his last 13 games.",
      "",
      "Started superbly with five goals and an assist in his first seven games to raise questions as to why Liverpool spent £125m on another striker, then endured a barren spell with no goals or assists in 12 games – largely off the bench – while Slot tried and failed to bed in his £125m striker, before he scored five goals in three games upon being reinstated to the starting XI to again raise questions as to why they signed an alternative £125m striker.",
      "Liverpool shouldn’t have signed the £125m striker.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham’ caveat have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs this term.",
      "He has ploughed a lone furrow as Spurs’ only real attacking outlet for much of the season under Thomas Frank and could very easily return from injury in April to play under a different manager.",
      "",
      "Four goals and two assists in 21 appearances isn’t enough but Cunha has this wonderful magnetic energy; stuff just happens around him on the football pitch.",
      "He’s one of our absolute favourite players to watch and has already proven beyond doubt – despite those relatively weak numbers – that he has the character required to avoid cowing under the pressure at Old Trafford as so many big-money signing have done before him.",
      "",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo looks to have bucked a very long trend in being a high-quality footballer who arrives at Old Trafford and continues being that very same high-quality footballer.",
      "Eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances is a very serviceable return and we can expect the hit-rate to increase should he continue to play in the No.9 position after his goal in the Manchester derby.",
      "",
      "As suckers for low stress, technically brilliant defensive midfielders we suspect we will be swooning over the Spaniard for a long time yet. While so many others struggle to come to terms with the pace and power of the Premier League, his transition has been seamless. His goal against Chelsea was sublime. Just a hugely impressive footballer.",
      "We know Oliver Glasner will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season (or sooner) but who is set to take over?",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after a run of drab Premier League draws. And now Xabi Alonso is available…",
      "Michael Carrick is the interim manager of Manchester United but will he be in charge next season?",
      "Chelsea fans won’t like it, but selling Cole Palmer to Man Utd might make sense for Clearlake and co with the England star one of few fit to replace Bruno ...",
      "Cole Palmer might be surprised to wake up to news that he ‘wants’ a transfer to Manchester United.",
      "Adopting the opposite approach to Amorim, using Maguire as a dressing-room influencer and ignoring loud-mouthed former players. This is Carrick’s Man Utd."

      "With Barcelona spending €534m in wages across the club, the La Liga giants ‘will need to offload salaries before being allowed to register new ones — or raise revenues’.",

      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",

      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",

      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest",
      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eliezer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",
      "Youssef En Nesyri impressed as Morocco reached the AFCON final and it has ramped up interest in him from a number of clubs across Europe.",
      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 16:05, UK",
      "United's first goal against City on Saturday evoked something for those present at Old Trafford. You could not help but feel something.",
      "Instantly my mind went back to iconic goals scored against Arsenal. Whether that was in the Champions League second-leg in 2009 - led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Park-ji Sung and Wayne Rooney - or a year later in the Premier League where Nani and Rooney (again) led their own devastating counter-attacking display against the Gunners.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener was not just a classic counter-attacking goal. If you look at that second goal I just mentioned - it mirrored Rooney's lung-bursting run among five Arsenal players to receive the ball from Nani to score. Amad Diallo and Mbeumo showed the same urgency when Bruno Fernandes found himself in the perfect position to lead the counter.",
      "Context is then required. The weeks of tension and impatience building from the Old Trafford crowd after dour and frustrating performances against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month had led to most thinking: where was their next win going to come from?",
      "The Manchester derby was an impressive victory for Michael Carrick and his backroom staff, but there is also a hesitance to get too carried away. Despite that being the best 90 minute performance in years, this United team have shown they can deliver in one-off games.",
      "But I am already more curious as to how this team will perform in the games after Arsenal when Carrick's side face Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "This is where we will find out whether they are in serious contention for a Champions League place.",
      "I said similar in November and December when they had a run of games against 'lower' positioned opposition and they failed to capitalise during that time which eventually led to Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "This is a second chance.",
      "It was quite clear watching some of United's training session this week and speaking to those around the club as they prepared for Arsenal that there have been some subtle changes.",
      "Carrick addressed the players at the start of the session, as Amorim would, but it was still intriguing to see how hands on Carrick was in his role as head coach as they began their drills. This was the first time we had a glimpse of training with our Sky cameras in attendance.",
      "From the open section we saw, watching Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate and Steve Holland run the session in unison was fascinating.",
      "Holland, in particular, made an impression - pushing and encouraging the players to maintain a high level. It sounds obvious but Holland's experience carried a certain authority that was notable from where we were standing.",
      "One change under Carrick and his backroom staff has been shortening the sessions while increasing the intensity within them. There has been a notable and positive reaction among the first team in response.",
      "Although we were not able to see this in the open part of the session, from what I understand another positive change has been the increase in individual work with different players in the squad.",
      "It was widely understood under Amorim, the team would spend a lot of time on the training ground walking through systems and formations they would set up in.",
      "Despite Amorim saying this time on the training ground would yield more positive results the more this side trained on the pitch, that did not happen. This is not a criticism of the Portuguese coach but whatever the team worked on, it did not lead to the consistency needed for him to succeed.",
      "The shorter but intense sessions coupled with an increased amount of time spent on individual work has led (albeit one game in) to a positive atmosphere being created under Carrick.",
      "But there is also important messaging from Carrick and his staff.",
      "As mentioned before, no one inside or outside Carrington will get carried away with one win against Manchester City because of the false starts under previous coaches.",
      "But as Carrick announced to the media during his first week in charge, he has told his players they should enjoy playing for the club and while not getting carried away, embrace the responsibility and privilege that comes with the shirt.",
      "Time will tell whether these changes will have a short-lived impact on the team or whether they will be the foundations of a successful second-half of the season for United.",
      "What is clear is that this coaching staff have made an impression on this group of players and after such a challenging 14 months under Amorim if they can start enjoying their football again then they may just find themselves in the Champions League next season.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 07:17, UK",
      "Manchester United have fallen to their lowest position in the Deloitte Football Money League, with Liverpool the highest-earning English club for the first time.",
      "The Red Devils were once regarded as the blueprint for commercial success in football and have topped the Money League in 10 of its 29 editions, most recently in 2017.",
      "However, United are down in eighth in the 2026 table, in part due to broadcast revenue dropping from €258m [£216.72m] to €206m [£172.9m] because of their absence from the Champions League in 2024-25.",
      "The club are set to generate even less matchday revenue in the current season due to their total absence from European competition, and their failure to go past the first hurdle in either domestic cup means they will play only 20 competitive fixtures at Old Trafford in 2025-26.",
      "\"The clubs with the biggest football club brands and position in the market have an opportunity to broaden their reach and offer more to fans on a matchday, offer more to fans on a non-matchday, and become a more 365-days-a-year touch point,\" said Tim Bridge, the Sports Business Group Leader at Deloitte. \"United are probably only just starting that journey now, because of the reported stadium development.",
      "\"If you went back 10 or 15 years, and you looked at Manchester United's matchday revenue it was the industry leader. If you looked at their ability to generate commercial revenue, it was the benchmark by which everybody then went to market and set their strategy. I don't think that remains the case.",
      "\"The opportunity remains for Manchester United. They are arguably still the biggest global football club brand, and therefore they have the opportunity to maximise that in a way that is only possible for a select few.",
      "\"But to do that requires fit-for-purpose facilities. As the industry evolves, clubs should ask themselves whether there is a need to rethink how they engage with fans and how that relationship works. With reports of the new stadium, it is clear they have started to do some of that, so it's very clear they're thinking in that way. Their timing of making that change is behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the opportunity remains.\"",
      "United are the fourth-placed English club in the 2026 Money League behind Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal, with Real Madrid top as they became the first team to record revenue over €1bn - €1.161bn or £975.2m.",
      "Liverpool sit fifth after their return to the Champions League in 2024-25 and a seven per cent increase in commercial revenue from non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "It is the first time there has not been an English team in the Money League top four, with Real, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain all benefiting from going deep in the newly expanded Champions League and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the summer.",
      "Deloitte said that the Club World Cup had resulted in a 17 per cent average uplift in broadcast revenues for the 10 Money League clubs who had been involved.",
      "Premier League teams may expect to fare better generally in the 2027 Money League, which will be the first to reflect the new broadcast deal which runs to 2029, but Bridge said the best-performing clubs would continue to be those who match on-field success with diversification off it.",
      "\"The trick to staying [in the top five] is maintaining both of those. It used to be you only had to maintain one of them. Now, in 2026, we're at a point where the highest revenue generating clubs are probably broader than football,\" he said.",
      "Manchester City's sixth place was their lowest since the Covid-19-impacted season of 2019-20.",
      "In all, nine Premier League clubs made it into the top 20 of the Money League, with Tottenham [ninth], Chelsea [10th], Aston Villa [14th], Newcastle [17th] and West Ham [20th].",
      "For a fourth year, the Deloitte Football Money League profiles 15 of the top revenue generating women's clubs globally. In another record-breaking year, these clubs reported average revenues in excess of €10m [£8.4m] for the first time, with cumulative revenues of €158m [£132.72m], marking an increase of 35 per cent on last year's total.",
      "Arsenal Women tops the list this year, dethroning FC Barcelona Femení for the first time, with revenues of €25.6m [£21.5m], an increase of 43 per cent from the previous season. Significant investment into fan data and activation helped garner attendances exceeding 35,000 on five separate occasions across the 2024/25 season.",
      "Chelsea Women ranks in a close second [£21.3m] while generating the highest commercial revenue among the top 15 [£16m]. FC Barcelona Femení [£18.5m] completes the top three after another successful domestic season.",
      "\"While growth has developed significantly in women's football in recent years, the shift from the start up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment, and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner,\" said Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
      "\"As further milestones are hit, including new and expanded competitions on the biggest stages, industry leaders must continue to innovate, while also protecting the wants and needs of fans and players to foster a more sustainable future for the game.\"",

      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb is unconvinced that Diogo Dalot’s challenge on Jeremy Doku in Man Utd’s 2-0 win over Man City was worthy of a red card - but is convinced that VAR was right not to intervene.",
      "Dalot escaped a red card for a 10th-minute tackle on Doku, which ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean believed was \"100 per cent\" a sending off.",
      "The Man Utd defender was only shown a yellow card by referee Anthony Taylor, with VAR Craig Pawson backing the on-field decision.",
      "Analysing the decision on Mic'd Up, Webb said: \"Is there excessive force? Some will say, yes. I'm not quite there, but I can see that there could be.",
      "\"It's a subjective judgment…but I'm absolutely aligned that once that decision is taken on the field, we leave it as referee's call and we don't intervene with the VAR.\"",
      "He added: \"I think it's one where the referee's call should stand on the field. That's what we've said we'll do where there's a mix of considerations.",

      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola felt Dalot should have been sent off after an early foul on Jeremy Doku.",
      "But VAR Pawson stood by Taylor's on-field decision, believing the contact was \"glancing and not with force\".",
      "Webb said: \"At full speed, when you play it in real time, you can see there's not a great deal of speed in the action, not a lot of intensity.",
      "\"We were heavily criticised a few years ago for using slow motion and freeze frames because people said, this is not reality. It's not how the game is played. When you slow it down, it can look a lot worse - and it does. When you freeze frame it, you can make a lot of situations look like red card offences.",
      "\"So it's difficult for me to hear people make a judgment on this just by analysing freeze frame and slow motion, coming to the consideration that it's red on that basis.",
      "\"Yes, it could be red, but you have to think about the need to look at it at full speed. We've done that for some time now. We thought it was a fair criticism some time ago when people said, 'Stop using slow-mos as the main way of analysing these situations'. And we've listened, and we agree. And we play it at full speed. Then we slow it down a little bit to see the exact point of contact to factor that in as well.",
      "\"But without speed and force and intensity, it's unlikely to be a red card.\"",
      "Speaking at half-time at Old Trafford, Keane said: \"Doku definitely helps him [by not staying down]. I'm no expert on red cards, but I think it's a red.\"",
      "Richards said: \"He [Dalot] is on top of his knee. That is as clear a red card as you are going to see. What more do you want?!\"",

      "Tuesday 20 January 2026 07:09, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has outlined his four-man shortlist to be the next Manchester United head coach, suggesting that their next permanent boss must be a candidate with the right \"energy\" and \"drive\" to lead the club forward.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a disastrous 14-month reign at the club and have since appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick secured an impressive 2-0 win against rivals Manchester City in his first game at the helm, but Carragher has insisted Old Trafford needs a \"special\" leader.",
      "Here are the options and what Carragher had to say...",
      "Current role: England manager",
      "What Carragher said: \"He's been in the Premier League before. He's obviously a top manager. The thing I like about him is I still think he's got that energy and drive and spikiness about him.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm crossing out Michael Carrick. I go back to this question - do I believe this guy can win the league? I have to believe he can. I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp will not be managing Manchester United. That is out. Xabi Alonso - he cannot do that. He can't, his affiliation with Liverpool. That can't happen.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti, for me, wouldn't have the energy or drive to get Man Utd back. Zinedine Zidane is a younger version of [Carlo] Ancelotti, but maybe I am wrong. Enzo Maresca is a no, but he is a really good coach.",
      "\"Xavi is one, at Barcelona, he won the league but enough experience for Manchester United? He only has a couple of years of experience as a manager.",
      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Sunday 18 January 2026 14:38, UK",
      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",

      "Asked if such comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: \"No, no, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Martinez said things at United were \"so different\" in the build-up to the win against City, with Michael Carrick taking charge of the team until the end of the season, following Darren Fletcher's brief interim spell in the hotseat after Ruben Amorim's exit.",
      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",

      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",
      "\"It's about the connection [with the fans], it's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like today, they will be with us.",

      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have continued their war of words with Manchester United's Lisandro Martinez, with Butt telling the Argentine to \"grow up\" over his response to criticism.",

      "\"I think when someone gets so upset about something in the media or a podcast…to come out and say, 'Come over to my house', f****** grow up.",
      "\"Literally, if you're going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, you shouldn't be at a big football club because you'll get that for the rest of your career at Man United.",
      "\"I got so much crap when I played at United and Newcastle, but the next week you get plaudits and clapped at. There's no personal issue with us and Martinez, none.\"",
      "Scholes praised Martinez's display but said he still has some doubts about the 28-year-old.",
      "\"It fuels people,\" he said of criticism. \"I think we have to take a bit of the credit for Martinez's performance on Saturday!\"",
      "But he then warned: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.",
      "\"I haven't changed my opinion yet. I'm still not sure you can win a league with him. He's got to do it over a period of time. What he did on Saturday, brilliant, but you've got to do it over a period of time.\"",
      "Butt said Martinez's reaction to their comments raised questions about his mentality.",
      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",
      "\"I was 18, not 26 or 27,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go out of the house for weeks, but you man up and go and prove people wrong.\"",
