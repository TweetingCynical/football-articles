      "Manchester United have AGREED terms with RB Leipzig to sign Benjamin Sesko and finally given Ruben Amorim the No.9 he has craved.",
      "Sesko, 22, emerged as a priority target for United in recent weeks after they completed the signing of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. And they have now beaten Newcastle to a deal for the Slovenia international after upping their initial offer following fresh talks with the German side.",
      "United will pay £66.4m up front and a further £7.4m in add-ons to sign Sesko. The former RB Salzburg man is now poised to fly to Manchester on Thursday to undergo a medical and complete the move. It comes as the real reason Sesko snubbed Newcastle to join the Red Devils comes to light.",
      "Sesko's arrival means United could start the new Premier League campaign with a brand new front three after concluding deals for Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo earlier this summer.",
      "The striker scored 21 goals in all competitions for Leipzig last season and was always expected to seal a blockbuster transfer ahead of the 2025-26 campaign.",
      "United's work in the transfer market to secure deals for three new attackers this summer follows the club's worst ever Premier League campaign, where they finished 15th. The Red Devils scored just 44 goals in 38 games during the season: the fifth worst record across the entire top-flight.",
      "Sesko had been heavily linked with Arsenal earlier in the summer and the Gunners, like United, are long-term admirers of the striker.",
      "However, talk of a move to the Premier League was put on ice when Arsenal instead chose to pursue a move for Viktor Gyokeres, who joined the Londoners from Sporting Lisbon, having grown frustrated with demands from both RBL and the Sesko camp.",
      "Newcastle made a big play to sign the striker and actually made a bigger offer to the German club, but it quickly emerged that Sesko's preference was a move to Manchester United. United have also agreed to play RBL in a pre-season friendly next summer.",
      "Sesko's arrival should be confirmed in good time ahead of the new season, which starts next week. United face Arsenal at Old Trafford in their season opener on Sunday 17 August."

      "Christian Eriksen has emerged as an ambitious transfer target for Premier League new boys Burnley after leaving Manchester United as a free agent earlier this summer.",
      "The Denmark international, 33, spent three years at Old Trafford after joining United from Brentford, making 107 appearances in total. And with a wealth of Premier League and international experience under his belt, Eriksen has no shortage of admirers as he weighs up his next move.",
      "Eriksen has attracted offers across the world from clubs who are keen on snapping up the attacking midfielder.",
      "But with Eriksen understood to be keen on staying in western Europe, the option of joining Burnley and remaining in England could appeal to the former Tottenham man.",
      "The Mail report that the Clarets have made contact with Eriksen over a possible deal, which would be regarded as a major coup for Scott Parker's side.",
      "It's claimed that Eriksen also has interest in his services from clubs in Germany and Spain which could scupper Burnley's chances of convincing the playmaker to sign up at Turf Moor.",
      "Eriksen's agent, Martin Schoots, recently confirmed that his client wants to stay in Europe. He told the same publication: \"Christian still wants to play in a first-tier competition and he absolutely wants to stay in Western Europe.",
      "\"There are some contacts going on but it has to suit both sides.\"",
      "Those comments came in the wake of an audacious approach from Wrexham, who have just been promoted to the Championship. The Red Dragons, owned by Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds, are in the market for marquee signings after winning three consecutive promotions to reach the second-tier.",
      "Phil Parkinson, Wrexham's manager, subsequently confirmed that contact had been made with Eriksen but that things had gone no further.",
      "\"There was a call, a bit of dialogue over the summer, but it's not gone any further than that,\" he told BBC Sport Wales. \"But obviously he's a majorly talented player and very well respected throughout football.\"",

      "Roy Keane's glowing assessment of Carlos Baleba might just be vindicated this summer as Manchester United ramp up their interest in the Brighton enforcer. The former Ireland captain was one of many who heaped praise on Baleba last season, and it seems United have sat up and taken note.",
      "They've made enquiries to Brighton about the 21-year-old's availability, according to The Athletic. After Moises Caicedo's big-money move to Chelsea in 2023, Baleba filled the void at the Amex and has quietly impressed in the role. Though not often in the spotlight, the Cameroon star has become an essential part of Brighton's engine room.",
      "Despite his low profile, Baleba's ability hasn't gone unnoticed - with United legend Keane waxing lyrical about him back in March. The 53-year-old not only commended Baleba's displays but also applauded Brighton's consistently sharp recruitment, with the club seemingly set to reap the rewards of their investment in the midfielder.",
      "\"It'll be interesting to see what happens this summer,\" Keane said on ITV following Baleba's standout performance in Brighton's FA Cup victory over Newcastle. \"Fantastic. Great example,\" he added. \"The other clubs must be looking at Brighton and thinking, how are they doing it?\"",
      "Although discussions are underway, United understand that signing Baleba from Brighton will be difficult. He still has three years left on his current contract, and the south coast club have gained a reputation for driving hard bargains - having secured big-money sales for players like Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White.",
      "To complicate matters further, United are still prioritising a move for Benjamin Sesko - a transfer that could consume much of their remaining budget. With approximately £130million already committed to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, landing Sesko could take their total spending close to or beyond the £200m mark.",
      "With no income yet from player sales and PSR concerns still looming, the Red Devils can ill afford to spend recklessly this summer. That said, signing a defensive midfielder is reportedly high on their agenda, and Baleba is among the leading candidates.",
      "Brighton, meanwhile, hold the advantage in negotiations. Not only is Baleba secured on a long-term contract, but the club has already brought in over £100m in sales this summer, cashing in on players like Pedro, Simon Adringa and Pervis Estupinan.",
      "Baleba, who has previously attracted attention from Liverpool, has also indicated he's content at Brighton for now. \"If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future,\" he said in May.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "Having arrived from Lille for a fee of around £24m, Baleba's price tag has reportedly skyrocketed, with suggestions Brighton could demand close to £100m for the promising midfielder.",
      "The Seagulls' reputation for uncovering undervalued talent, developing them, and selling at a premium has set a benchmark in football recruitment in recent years. Even as their spending power grows, they continue to generate impressive profits through strategic player sales.",
      "This summer may see a showdown between Brighton's calculated transfer planning and United's drive to land elite talent. Whether Keane's prediction proves accurate remains to be seen - but if negotiations advance, this could become one of the window's most compelling transfer sagas.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand feels Harry Maguire has practically 'risen from the dead' under Ruben Amorim. The seasoned centre-half joined Manchester United back in 2019, but his Old Trafford tenure has been far from plain sailing.",
      "Maguire played a big part in the club's eighth-place finish under Erik ten Hag in the 2023/24 campaign. As a result, the 32-year-old received a wealth of criticism for his performances on the pitch by fans, pundits and club legends alike. Maguire was phased out under Ten Hag as United kicked off last season, deemed surplus to requirements by the Dutchman.",
      "But when Amorim arrived as his successor in November, the Sheffield-born player was able to fight his way back into the team and show some incredible individual performances – despite United ultimately finishing in 15th in the Premier League.",
      "As a result, Maguire now appears to be a part of Amorim's plans for the new season. While he is out of contract next summer, and with a wealth of interest coming from three Premier League clubs – as well as two teams in Italy – it seems increasingly likely that Maguire will stay put. All five transfer approaches were knocked back by United, as per The Daily Mail.",
      "Maguire is said to be keen on signing another extension, which would see him retire at Old Trafford. While the club are said to be on the same page, no formal talks have begun as of yet.",
      "Speaking about Maguire's career resurgence on his Rio Presents podcast alongside Joel Beya, Ferdinand was quick to praise the character and resilience he had shown in hard times.",
      "The former Manchester United and England star said: \"I ain't got that bad energy energy for players or for the club, I want them to do well. But if they don't play well, I'm gonna say what I see, and I had that discussion with Harry Maguire.\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"We had the tough questions like that, what's it like you having criticism? And someone who risen from the dead almost, shown character. He was down and out, but he's come back. So to show that character and resilience, it was nice to just get beneath the skin and talk with him about it.\"",
      "Maguire's decision to remain at Old Trafford last summer despite Ten Hag's decision has seemingly paid dividends, with Amorim since finding a role in the squad for the former club captain and rewarding him with a one-year contract extension in January.",
      "On top of that, Amorim has also included Maguire in a six-man leadership group alongside Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, as he looks to utilise the passing down of experience of senior players to younger members of the squad.",
      "Speaking about the cohort, Amorim said: \"We have a leadership group now. It's not just Bruno. It's not just Harry. It's six guys. They are responsible for the group. There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with and I said to them this season, you deal with that.",
      "\"Small issues are with you guys. You're responsible. All these small changes, but I think it's helping the group. We have Bruno, we have Harry, Licha [Martinez], Diogo, Tom and Nous.\"",
      "Maguire has also excelled during United's pre-season tour of America, starting in the side's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "It will be interesting to see if he starts when United face Fiorentina at Old Trafford come Saturday. Their Premier League opener follows on Sunday, August 17 against Arsenal, where Maguire could face former Red Devils target Viktor Gyokeres, who Amorim knows all about from their time together at Sporting CP.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Pogba has launched a luxury jewellery business with wife Zulay as he looks to get his life back on track following his doping scandal. The French midfielder recently signed a two-year deal with AS Monaco, restarting his footballing journey after receiving a ban for failing a drug test.",
      "Now, Pogba is eager to put his recent troubles behind him as he launches 'Unbreakable', a luxury collection in collaboration with his wife and jewellery house Elke Berr. Speaking to Var-Matin, Zulay described the struggles her husband has been through as something that created an extremely strong bond between them.",
      "She said: \"Paul’s problems were public. It affected us as a couple. It affected our children. We have been through very tough times, but we have stayed united. This is what we wanted to communicate through the collection: you are not alone in facing difficulties, what matters is getting back up.\"",
      "Pogba was once revered as one of the brightest talents in Europe. He found success at Juventus before returning to Manchester United, winning multiple trophies at the highest level. However, in 2023, the midfielder was initially suspended from playing after failing a drug test, with DHEA found in his system while in his second stint in Turin.",
      "More failed results followed, and the Italian side mutually agreed to terminate his contract after Pogba was banned from playing for four years by the Italian Anti-Doping National Tribunal. This ban was later reduced to 18 months, and he was allowed back into the competitive foray by March of this year.",
      "It wasn't just the stress of Pogba's drug ban that brought the couple closer together, though. The French international saw his brother, Mathias, sentenced to three years in prison in 2024 - with two years suspended - for attempted extortion of the ex-United star.",
      "The former footballer had been accused, alongside five other men, of attempting to extort €13million (£10.7m) from Pogba, and was found guilty last year - despite protesting his innocence throughout.",
      "Now, the current Monaco midfielder is trying to put his past behind him and focus on the future with his wife and children, with the jewellery business a joint venture between the two. Discussing their struggles, Zulay said: \"Unbreakable isn’t just about Paul and me.",
      "\"It’s a shared story – that of a child with their mother or father, sisters, brothers, two best friends. These bonds help us not to be defeated by life’s roller coaster. For us, Unbreakable is more than just a jewellery collection. It’s a symbol.\"",
      "The collection offers many different styles of jewellery, from necklaces to rings and bracelets, and is available on the Elke Berr Joaillerie website. Pogba and his partner plan to open a showroom in Monaco next September in collaboration with Monte-Carlo Diamonds.",
      "The Bolivian model added: \"What we went through was seen by many because it was public. But getting back up isn’t just about returning to sport, it’s about returning to life.\"",
      "As Ligue 1 returns in a week, Pogba will hope his life will remain positive. For now, fans will assume a spot in France's 2026 World Cup squad is a potential pipe dream - but the 32-year-old will be back on the pitch soon enough.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba highlighted his elite mentality when dismissing transfer rumours last year. The Brighton star has attracted interest from a number of top clubs, but rather than getting caught up in all the noise, Baleba has insisted he just wants to get his head down and work hard.",
      "United have splurged well over £100million on attacking talent this summer and are nearing a deal for another forward - Benjamin Sesko - for a fee of around £74m.",
      "But they are yet to secure a central midfielder, arguably one of the areas they most need to bolster, especially considering Ruben Amorim's doubts about Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte, as well as the fact that Casemiro is not getting any younger.",
      "That could soon change, though, as reports emerged on Wednesday evening claiming United intermediaries had reached out to Brighton to discuss a potential deal for 21-year-old Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba matches the profile of the midfielder Ineos have been targeting for United, considering his age, skillset, and top-flight experience. Rio Ferdinand told United chiefs to prioritise a move for him over Sesko last month, labelling him as a midfielder who can 'do it all'.",
      "The 21-year-old has also shown valuable traits, including a strong work ethic and humility during his short time at Brighton. He demonstrated his character last year when quizzed about being linked with a transfer amid rumoured interest from clubs like Liverpool.",
      "When asked about talk of a potential move to other Premier League sides, Baleba emphasised he was not focused on other clubs. Instead, he stated he was eager to keep progressing and even hinted he may not be ready to be a star player at a top club.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.",
      "\"I don’t know if I’m going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot. Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn’t do it for me.",
      "\"It’s not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "The Red Devils appeared to receive a boost in their plans to sign Baleba when journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that agreeing personal terms is unlikely to be a stumbling block with the player, who still has three years remaining on his current contract at the AMEX Stadium.",
      "However, Brighton chief Paul Barber has since denied claims of United making an approach for the player, labelling the transfer links as mere \"speculation\". The Athletic also reported that Brighton have no plans to sanction a sale this summer and wish to retain Baleba for another year.",
      "That could be a significant setback to Ruben Amorim's hopes of signing him, given Brighton's reputation for being tough negotiators. At this point, it also seems unlikely that United will be in the financial position to offer the sort of money that would be required to tempt Brighton into parting with their star player.",
      "The Cameroon international joined Brighton in 2023 following the departures of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo. Since his arrival, he has developed into one of the Premier League's most impressive central midfielders, featuring in 77 matches for the Seagulls across all competitions.",

      "A host of Premier League clubs, including the Gunners, United and Liverpool, have spent the summer looking for a new No 9. Arsenal have since signed Gyokeres with United now closing in on a deal for Sesko. Liverpool themselves are keen on snapping up Alexander Isak.",
      "Nunez was tipped to exit Anfield heading into the summer after scoring just five times in the top-flight last season.",
      "And while he has tentatively been linked with other clubs in England in recent months, the Uruguay star is poised to move to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Hilal.",
      "But as Nunez prepares to undergo a medical before completing his £46million move, Saunders has questioned why Liverpool's domestic rivals decided against pursuing a move for the striker.",
      "\"Nunez, he’s up for grabs. Would you rather not have Nunez than Sesko and Gyokeres?’ Saunders said on talkSPORT. \"They paid a lot of money for them, and I thought, ‘He’s up for grabs.’ I would take a chance on him.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"He’s got every finish in his locker, both feet, headers, he’s gone round the keeper, he’s slotted the keeper, he’s chipped the keeper, he’s scored from distance.",
      "\"We’ve seen him do every finish, but somehow he manages to conjure up a miss – I don’t know how many times he hit the post and the crossbar last season.",
      "\"There’s definitely a player in there, you look at him and think, ‘What a handful he is to play against.’",
      "\"He scored a lot of goals for Benfica in his second season and a couple of seasons ago he got 20-odd for Liverpool. I wouldn’t be surprised if Nunez goes somewhere else and scores 20 goals next season.\"",
      "With Nunez now off the books at Anfield, Liverpool are expected to sign a replacement before the transfer window shuts next month. Isak remains their primary target, however, Newcastle do not want to sell their star striker and it's thought Liverpool would need to pay at least £150m to bring the Sweden star to Merseyside.",

The youngster is one of the stars of the club's academy and is enjoying an impressive time as part of the setup.",

The academy star capped off a remarkable turnaround for his side in extra time after the team came back from three goals down with just 12 minutes left on the clock, against local rivals Manchester City.",
      "The youngster has had to contend with having a famous father too during his time coming through the youth ranks. \"A few years ago, I remember my son Kai took a penalty at St George’s Park, where we were for a tournament,\" Coleen told the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It went to penalties, Kai stepped up and just skied it. Afterwards I asked him how he could take a penalty like that, and he told me he was just fuming as the goalkeeper was saying ‘Your dad’s s***’, and he got dead angry.",
      "\"It doesn’t happen to him very often, but it did then, and you can see in some games where they give you a little push. He’s strong-minded though and usually shrugs it off.\"",

      "Danny Welbeck has previously tipped Manchester United transfer target Carlos Baleba to become one of the best midfielders in the world. United head coach Ruben Amorim has mainly focussed on bolstering his attack this summer, but is turning attention to the middle of the park.",
      "The Red Devils began the transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, before going on to splash £71million on Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, while 18-year-old defensive prospect Diego Leon also arrived in-between those arrivals.",
      "RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is also closing in on a mega-money move to Old Trafford, and it seems that once that deal is done, United could turn to Baleba, having now been linked with a swoop for the Cameroon international.",
      "The Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder, who has previously been admired by Chelsea, has caught United's eye with his impressive performances for Fabian Hurzeler's side. He has also more than impressed team-mate and former United forward Welbeck, who believes Baleba has the potential to become one of the best in world football.",
      "In an interview with BBC Radio Sussex back in November last year, Welbeck explained his thoughts on the 21-year-old. The ex-Arsenal forward said: \"He can be unstoppable. If he keeps up with that desire and passion, he can go right to the top. He’s got all of the attributes to be a world-beater.”",
      "Welbeck is not the only former United star who has been impressed by Baleba. Rio Ferdinand recently admitted he would like to see his former side try and sign the promising box-to-box midfielder.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the former England and United skipper said: \"I’m being greedy, and [if] we are able to shift the other players that are surplus to requirements, I’d be going for Baleba in midfield.",
      "\"[He] beats the press on a regular basis. [He’s] confident on the ball. [He] can move, is mobile. He is a Ruben Amorim midfielder.”",
      "According to The Athletic, United have already made contact with Brighton about a potential move for Baleba. However, it's also claimed the Red Devils would need to sell some unwanted players such as Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, before they can make a meaningful bid for Baleba.",
      "The midfielder has three years left on his deal, which gives the Seagulls plenty of room to demand a high fee. Two seasons ago, Brighton extracted £115m from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo, a Premier League record transfer at the time.",
      "It's understood Brighton may demand a similar transfer fee for Baleba, although United are thought to value him at around £70m.",
      "When asked about the Red Devils' interest in Baleba, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber told spectators at a supporters event: \"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",
      "\"If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian [head coach Hurzeler] with a very competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him. We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world, which isn't always predictable.\"",

      "Considered one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League, Baleba's stock has been steadily rising over the course of that time. Reports emerged on Wednesday claiming that United had been in touch to explore the conditions of a move.",
      "Financing the deal would be one part of the equation while convincing Baleba would be another. Fortunately for the Red Devils, they can turn to Leny Yoro.",
      "Defender Yoro played played alongside the 21-year-old for Lille and the pair were said to be good friends at the Ligue 1 club. They follow one another on social media and regularly like each other's posts.",
      "Should Yoro need some help, Bryan Mbeumo and Andre Onana both play alongside Baleba for Cameroon. If they were to become team-mates again, though, it'd be on Brighton's terms.",

      "Benjamin Sesko will have to adhere to a host of new rules when he joins Manchester United. The Red Devils are closing in on a £74million deal for the RB Leipzig striker, despite competition from Newcastle.",
      "Sesko favours a move to Old Trafford over the Magpies and has told RB Leipzig chiefs of his desire. United have made a first bid - although it was lower than Newcastle's offer - and are continuing talks to strike a deal, with the Slovenia international increasingly likely to be the No.9 that Ruben Amorim has chased for much of the summer.",
      "However, the 22-year-old may be in for a stark wake-up call should he arrive in the northwest, given how Amorim has wasted no time in laying down the law since his own arrival last November. The Portuguese tactician has implemented a number of new rules since taking over from Erik ten Hag, with hopes of turning the tide at United.",
      "The first major rule that the 40-year-old implemented upon his arrival was banning his coaches from dishing out complex instructions, with the ideology that things need to be simplified before they are passed down.",
      "He also decided to ban players from using international breaks as holiday opportunities, after Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetted off to the United States in November for leisure after being left out of their respective national teams.",
      "Amorim said of the changes: \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim has also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays after emphasising that he looks to prioritise physical fitness within his team, while the fourth rule that Amorim has put in place sees losing teams in training sessions forced to pick up equipment used on the day.",
      "Amorim has upped his standards ahead of the new campaign, following a disastrous Premier League campaign that saw the Red Devils finish 15th in the league standings. Diogo Dalot has stressed that the club may not be for everyone at present.",
      "Speaking about Amorim's way of doing things, the Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",
      "Amorim's side have made a decent impression in his first pre-season at the club. The Red Devils held a newly-promoted Leeds United to a goalless draw last month, before embarking on their Premier League Summer Series tour of the United States.",
      "They secured 2-1 and 4-1 wins over West Ham and Bournemouth, as well as a 2-2 draw with Everton. The side are now set to return to Old Trafford to face Fiorentina on Saturday, before their Premier League opener against Arsenal lands on August 17.",

      "Manchester United’s next transfer has been branded a “bully” by a top Premier League midfielder. With United closing in on a move for RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, attention has shifted to stiffening up Ruben Amorim’s midfield.",
      "Brighton’s Carlos Baleba has emerged as the club’s number one target. It's understood contact has already been made with the south coast club, although his arrival would need to be coupled with departures following United’s summer spending spree and United have quite the job on their hands persuading Brighton to cash in on a player they rate as being worth £100m already.",
      "The 21-year-old has been a revelation since joining the Seagulls from Lille in 2023. Aston Villa midfielder Amadou Onana was at the French club at the same time and saw a young Baleba take no prisoners when he stepped up to train with the first team.",
      "Onana told the Inside Scoop: “When I arrived, he was playing with the B team. I just saw a strong kid, he’s the strongest kid I’ve ever seen. Jacked! He used to come up [to train with the first team] and be free, he’d bully the pros.”",
      "Onana, 23, said he wasn’t surprised that Baleba is now rated so highly, as he praised his down-to-earth nature. He said: “He’s done his thing and I always knew he had what it takes to get to the high level. He’s a really good kid, really humble, works hard.”",
      "Brighton don't want to sell Baleba this year and will demand £100m given he has three years left on his contract. United value him at closer to £70m and it has been suggested that Baleba could ask the Seagulls to lower their asking price. But with Brighton preferring to sell in 2026 and planning for the upcoming campaign with him, they're unlikely to budge.",
      "Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has tried to play down the speculation surrounding Baleba. He told a fans’ forum: \"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. So from that point of view, speculation is speculation. We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us.",

      "First, United are looking to finalise a deal for Sesko, having lodged a bid of around £65.3m plus £8.7m in add-ons. Newcastle also want the Slovenian, but he is believed to be favouring a move to Old Trafford.",

      "The Cameroon star enjoyed a stellar year last season and the Seagulls have no plans to cash in any time soon, but that hasn't stopped the Red Devils trying to see whether it would be possible to do a deal.",
      "Ferdinand's tweet appears to be a play on words of the phrase \"who's a believer\" as the Manchester outfit attempt to secure another major deal this summer. Those at Old Trafford are aware the move may be unrealistic, especially if they get a deal for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko over the line.",
      "Baleba has three years left on his contract at the Amex but is proving to be one of the Premier League's best in his position. He is the latest in a long line of players who have joined Brighton as relatively unknown quantities before morphing into a genuine superstar.",
      "United's current focus is on landing Sesko from RB Leipzig and they have jumped ahead of Newcastle in the transfer race. There is an acceptance though that any move, which could cost more than £70million, will make a swoop for the Brighton star very difficult - particularly with the Seagulls valuing Baleba at £100m.",
      "A striker is currently the priority for Ruben Amorim, who has already bought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for more than £120m. If they can secure a No.9 then a midfielder capable of playing in the number six role is next on their hit list and Baleba would fit that profile.",
      "United's two midfielders need to be highly energetic and smart off the ball with Amorim's system leaving them to run the engine room. The likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have played in those roles last term, but the club will look to make improvements if they can.",
      "The Brighton star previously said on all the speculation surrounding him: \"If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future. In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "Brighton are under no pressure to sell and have been making plans to keep Baleba this term, before letting him move to a so-called bigger club next summer. By then, they hope, they can land a fee worth more than the £115m Chelsea paid to prise Moises Caicedo to Stamford Bridge from the south coast.",
      "Ferdinand is backing his former side, who finished 15th last term, to make notable improvements and believes either seventh or eighth is on the cards. However he said he admitted: \"Revisit this if we get one or two more signings and I might change my answer.\"",

      "And while that should be seen as a coup for Old Trafford decision-makers, evidence that despite their decade of decline they remain a bigger draw than a side that finished in the top five last season, it is a huge blow for the Toon who still fear the sale of Alexander Isak to Liverpool.",
      "But there are also knock-on effects for the dressing room Sesko is heading towards in the north west with his impending arrival set to alter the roles of team-mates - and leave the future of at least one star in serious jeopardy.",
      "Here is how United’s latest arrival could impact Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee plus new arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After two frustrating seasons in which he has struggled to score consistently with the confidence draining slowly from him, speculation for much of the summer to date has surrounded the Denmark striker being sold.",
      "Sesko’s arrival will increase the likelihood of that happening significantly with United willing to accept a fee in the range of half the £72m they paid Atalanta for Hojliund in the summer of 2023. A number of Serie A sides have been linked but no interest has translated into a formal offer yet.",
      "Hojlund himself is determined to transform his fortunes and was unfazed about transfer speculation with the likes of Sesko: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.\"",
      "Injury problems may have hindered an average debut season at the club but he does have the size and skillset that could provide Ruben Amorim with scope to mix things up.",

      "The Brazil star thrived cutting in from the wing while at Wolves and Sesko being the central member of the front three will surely bring the best out of Cunha. He linked up impressively with Jorgen Strand Larsen as the middleman at Molineux and Amorim will expect similar with Sesko.",
      "United’s other big summer arrival is in a similar boat to Cunha.",
      "At Brentford last season he spent a lot of time operating more centrally but arguably his best work in West London came when providing more width, stretching opposition defences and simultaneously hurting them himself by switching inside or ensuring more space for his team-mates to thrive.",

The Red Devils are confident they have beaten Newcastle to his signing, with the deal set to take their summer spending to around £200m in total.",
      "They have also explored a move for Brighton star Baleba, whou wouldn't come cheap. According to The Athletic, the move is likely unrealistic given United's spending power, but they are still testing the water in an effort to get an idea of whether a move might be possible.",
      "Signing both Sesko and Baleba in this window would require significant sales elsewhere, something which doesn't appear to be on the cards. There is likely to be some money coming in, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony all potentially leaving before the window shuts, but that would counterbalanced by the outlay for Sesko.",
      "United have already spent big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo while also bringing in young left-back Diego Leon. A move for Baleba is likely to have to wait until 2026, despite Amorim having limited options in front of the defence.",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille in the summer of 2023, just a fortnight after the Seagulls sold fellow midfielder Moises Caicedo to Chelsea. The Cameroon international made 34 league appearances last term, scoring his first goals for the club, and was asked about his future in May.",
      "\"If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future,\" he said. \"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.\"",
      "United's season begins against Arsenal on August 17, and Ruben Amorim's side have impressed in pre-season. They claimed two wins and a draw in their three Premier League Summer Series fixtures, and head coach Amorim has seen plenty of positives.",
      "\"I think it's a perfect feeling to go back to Carrington,\" Amorim said ahead of Saturday's friendly against Fiorentina. \"The momentum of the tour was perfect.",
      "\"We had two weeks to work in a good environment with a good feeling to go back to Carrington. We are near to the start of the season and we are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta insists Viktor Gyokeres will be \"100 per cent\" mentally ready to kickstart Arsenal's Premier League campaign with a bang against Manchester United. The Swede worked tirelessly on his first Emirates outing on Wednesday night but was starved of service as the Gunners were beaten 3-2 at home by Villarreal in their penultimate pre-season fixture. Gyokeres was subbed on 63 minutes but Arteta has no doubts he'll be in a position to hit the ground running this season, starting at Old Trafford.",
      "Arteta said of his marquee £63.7million summer capture: \"I think mentally and understanding what he needs to do, he will be 100 per cent or more because he's so willing. He's so confident as well that he can deliver for us straight away, I have no doubt he'll be in a really good place.\"",
      "Gyokeres has endured a gruelling, whirlwind summer, but Arteta is adamant he noticed immediate chemistry with his new Arsenal team-mates on the pitch.",
      "When asked how long it may take to click for the 27-year-old striker, the Spaniard added: \"I hope just days, every day in training I think he's getting a really good feeling.",
      "\"I think he's built connections as well outside of the pitch, which I think is really important with players that are going to help him to be in the position that he needs to get in.",
      "\"He hasn't trained really with the team for two months, so he's done five or six sessions now before today. I think he will take another step in the right direction on Saturday and he will be in a better condition.\"",
      "Teenage sensation Max Dowman dazzled from the bench but Arteta revealed the 15-year-old starlet is now heading on holiday for a well-earned break. The Arsenal boss was unable to provide any assurances that Dowman will be making his top-flight debut imminently ahead of the new season.",
      "He said of the nimble attacker: \"Let's see how it goes. Let's go into Saturday, into his break as well. He needs a little break because he hasn't had any holidays really. So, in the next few days, he's going to have a break, which I think he needs. Then the following week, he'll be ready again to go.\"",
      "Arsenal play Athletic Club on Saturday in their final pre-season fixture before they gear up for the trip to Manchester United. Arteta has no doubt his side are the finished article - they now just have to prove it after three second-place finishes.",
      "He continued: \"We know we need to make the next step and we're going to be better. The same as any other team, when you look at the competition, the pieces on the puzzle that they're adding, some of the ones are big ones as well. So, we're all trying to be at our best and ready to compete to win the Premier League.\"",

      "The Red Devils are aware the move may be unrealistic, especially if their transfer funds to end up being spent on Benjamin Sesko, but are looking to gauge whether anything can be done in the coming weeks as Ruben Amorim seeks to further bolster his squad, reports the Athletic.",
      "The 21-year-old has three years left on his contract at the Amex but is proving to be one of the Premier League's best in his position as Brighton continue to find hidden gems in the market. This time though they have no plans to cash in.",
      "Previously they've bought in the likes of Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister before seeing them flourish and move on for a huge profit. This is not one of those scenarios though and those on the south coast want to retain Baleba.",
      "United's current focus is on landing Sesko from RB Leipzig after they jumped ahead of Newcastle in the transfer race. There is an acceptance though that any move, which could cost more than £70million, will make any move for the Brighton star very difficult.",
      "They would be reliant on a number of players leaving the club for sizeable fees. Amorim does have the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony looking for the exit door, but the trio remain at Old Trafford as things stand.",
      "A striker is currently the priority in Manchester, given they have already bought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. But if they can secure a No 9 then a midfielder capable of playing in the number six role is next on their hit list and Baleba has excelled in that position.",
      "Already this summer Brighton have allowed Joao Pedro to leave for Chelsea, banking them a hefty sum. The highly-rated Simon Adingra has also joined Sunderland for more than £20m, which means they have little need to sell, putting them in a strong position to retain Baleba.",
      "The Brighton star previously said on all the speculation surrounding him: \"If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop.

      "Manchester United icon Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta even wanted new striker signing Viktor Gyökeres. Scholes also fears that the Swede may not adapt well to the Gunners' high levels of possession.",
      "After struggling without a bona fide No. 9 for some time, Arsenal finally completed a deal for Sporting CP star Gyökeres last month, snapping him up after a summer of speculation for roughly £64million.",
      "The Gunners fought off competition from Premier League rivals United for the 27-year-old, but Red Devils legend Scholes has now questioned whether head coach Arteta wanted the player, and whether Gyökeres will prosper in light of Arsenal's high-possession playstyle.",
      "\"[Arsenal needed a] Centre forward, I just wonder if you've chosen the right one,\" Scholes declared on The Overlap Fan Debate. \"Because there was a lot of um-ing and ah-ing about it, I wondered if Mikel Arteta really wanted him, as the main one he wants? I'm not too sure, and he's got him now.",
      "\"He's had a really strange career path - Brighton, Coventry, and then he's gone to Sporting Lisbon and his goal record is absolutely brilliant – you can't take it away from him.\"",
      "Gyökeres netted a staggering 97 times in 102 matches for Sporting in all competitions over the past two seasons, but Scholes doubts whether the Gunners' style of play suits him.",
      "\"If there's any team that he could go to and create chances, then it should be Arsenal and it should be a really good match,\" continued Scholes.",
      "\"The only thing I'd say against Gyökeres really is that with Sporting Lisbon, he's probably playing on the counter-attack a lot, in Europe especially.",
      "\"You think of Arsenal, they have the ball an awful lot, is he going to be clever enough to make these runs in behind? A lot of him that you see, he's sprinting from the halfway line almost.",
      "\"You can't keep up with him, he's ramming people, he's quick and he's smashing the ball in. Is he going to be that clever striker – we know Isak can do that. Can Gyökeres do that?\"",

      "\"I think you've all seen what he's done in his career so far,\" claimed Odegaard. \"Especially the last season at Sporting, the numbers speak for themselves. He's a very complete player. He's physical, strong, fast, good finisher and intelligent as well.",
      "\"I think he's a very complete striker and you can also see the hunger, the energy he brings. I'm really excited to have him with the team. He's only trained a few times, but you can already see the quality, the energy, and the willingness. I'm excited to have a pitch with him.\"",

      "Incoming Manchester United recruit Benjamin Sesko is the top scorer under the age of 23 in Europe's five biggest leagues over the past two seasons. Ruben Amorim appears to be getting a new No. 9 in the form of RB Leipzig star Sesko, who is the subject of a £65.3million bid from the Red Devils, which could rise to nearly £74m if certain add-ons are achieved.",
      "Premier League rivals Newcastle have also shown interest in the striker and have put forward a more lucrative proposal than United's, but the 22-year-old's preference is a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko is currently training separately from his Leipzig colleagues, according to a statement released by his club, and while some have expressed doubts about his abilities and hefty price tag, his goal-scoring statistics speak for themselves.",
      "This puts him one goal ahead of Real Madrid and England sensation Jude Bellingham, and five goals ahead of Florian Wirtz, whose summer transfer to Liverpool could set a British record if certain add-ons are met.",
      "In fourth place on the list is Bayern Munich phenom Jamal Musiala, who has racked up 33 goals during this period, followed by PSG's Bradley Barcola and German ace Maximilian Beier on 26.",
      "Sesko's impressive goal-scoring record, outperforming some of Europe's top young talents, will be a welcome sound to Amorim's ears. It suggests that the 22-year-old won't be overwhelmed when he arrives in Manchester, and United are fully committed to Sesko, having already agreed personal terms with him.",
      "Current Red Devil Rasmus Hojlund, who also scored 26 goals during this period, underscores the gap between him and Sesko. Despite not being entirely goal-shy since his £72m move to Old Trafford in 2023, the Dane has struggled to meet high expectations.",
      "Now, it seems likely that Sesko will join United, and Hojlund is reportedly prepared for the possibility of being pushed out if the Slovenian signs. Just two seasons after his £72m transfer, Hojlund could be available for as little as £30m, less than half of what was originally paid for him.",
      "However, during United's pre-season tour of the US, Hojlund expressed optimism about his future, stating: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "\"I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

      "After finishing 15th in the Premier League last season, Manchester United have had no choice but to attack in this summer's transfer window.",
      "A bottom half finish, a trophyless campaign and another season that featured more upheaval off the pitch meant United signed off for the summer with very little optimism for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final in Bilbao ended United's hopes of qualifying for this season's Champions League, meaning they will be without European football for the first time since 2014/15 this term.",
      "The biggest concern immediately raised on the back of United's failure to qualify for Europe's premier club competition was about this summer's window. With no European football on offer, it was feared United could find life difficult in the market.",
      "Instead, with just under four weeks to go until the September 1 deadline, United are still in with a chance of having their strongest summer window in years - and much of it stems from rolling back the years and readopting a former blueprint.",
      "Having finished last season with a negative goal difference of -10 in the Premier League, United have rightfully prioritised attacking signings in this summer's transfer window, so far bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "The duo were among the Premier League's best players last season, scoring 35 league goals between them. United wasted no time in signing Cunha, triggering his £62.5million release clause on the opening day of the window, before setting their sights on Mbeumo and eventually getting him through the door last month.",
      "Cunha, who is well-versed in a three-at-the-back system, is a tailor-made fit for the left-sided No.10 spot in Ruben Amorim's team, whereas Mbeumo offers a multifunctional option in the attacking department. Both players are goalscorers and were linked with moves to Premier League clubs that could have offered them Champions League football this coming season before putting pen to paper on long-term deals at Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha, who finalised his move to United on June 12, became the first attacker United had signed from a Premier League counterpart on a permanent basis since Alexis Sanchez arrived from Arsenal in January 2018.",
      "United were big spenders in the 2017/18 campaign, making four statement signings, of which three already played in the Premier League. Prior to signing Sanchez in the mid-season window, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic arrived from Everton and Chelsea respectively ahead of the start of the season.",
      "Since signing the aforementioned trio, United have not signed three Premier League players in the same window. However, that could change before the end of this window amid their interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "Despite making attacking signings a priority this summer, United are desperate to strengthen their midfield before the bell sounds at the start of next month. They lack energy and aggression in the middle of the pitch, making the addition of a new midfielder vitally important.",
      "Baleba, 21, joined Brighton from Lille in 2023 and has gone from strength-to-strength ever since, becoming one of the most exciting youngsters in the Premier League. According to The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with Brighton via intermediaries.",
      "Although the Cameroonian is only 21 and has just 61 Premier League appearances to his name, he has quickly proven he is a quality operator at this level. He was one of the best all-round midfielders in the division last season, demonstrating he can provide the traits United are desperately lacking in the engine room.",
      "Baleba, who has previously addressed his hunger for winning silverware, is another example of Brighton's fabulous scouting system. The Seagulls are the masters of unearthing hidden gems, polishing them and selling them on for a handsome profit.",
      "Although no transfer offers the guarantee of success, there is less risk involved when signing players who are already proven in the league you need them to perform in. Cunha and Mbeumo are statement signings for United, and Baleba would be the same if he were to end up at Old Trafford.",
      "After taking one too many gambles on overseas imports in recent years, it has been refreshing to see United roll back the years this summer. Mbeumo and Cunha are excellent additions and have the necessary qualities to thrive in M16, meaning Baleba could potentially follow suit.",
      "This particular approach rarely let Ferguson down.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

He last featured when the Reds were beaten 1-0 by the ASEAN All-Stars in a post-season tour friendly in May.",

      "Capable of doing a little bit of everything in the engine room, the 21-year-old would provide the energy, aggression and ball-carrying expertise United sorely lack in midfield. However, it remains to be seen if United will be able to fund a deal for him amid their ongoing pursuit of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Signed from Lille in August 2023, Baleba has gone from strength-to-strength in Brighton colours, producing a collection of eye-catching midfield performances. His all-round game makes him a very attractive player.",
      "Taking inspiration from Manchester City midfield star Rodri, Baleba revealed in May that he has ambitions of winning the Ballon d'Or in the future, admitting he has earned encouragement from Premier League colleagues, including United ace Cunha.",
      "\"Declan Rice, Matheus Cunha, Joelinton, they've all told me I've got it in me,\" Baleba told The Sun earlier this summer. \"I want to win the Ballon d'Or like Rodri.",

      "Manchester United will be targeting a winning conclusion to their pre-season preparations when they face Fiorentina at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime.",
      "United returned to more familiar surroundings earlier this week after spending just under a fortnight in the United States for their pre-season tour. The US trip proved to he highly successful both on and off the field.",
      "United participated in the Premier League Summer Series and brought the trophy home with them after victories over West Ham United (2-1) and Bournemouth (4-1) before drawing with Everton (2-2).",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim will have been pleased with what he saw from his players, particularly in the two aforementioned victories, with their performances really sharp and encouraging.",
      "But with just over a week to go until their Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford, Amorim, his coaching staff and the players and busy putting the hard yards in on the Carrington training pitches. With that said, here are five things MEN Sport spotted from their latest session:",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana and attacker Joshua Zirkzee both featured in team training after so far playing no part in United's pre-season preparations. Onana has been absent because of a hamstring injury and Zirkzee has been missing because of a small injury issue. They both went on the tour of the US but played no part in any of the three friendlies United played.",
      "Matheus Cunha has enjoyed a solid first pre-season at United thus far, featuring in three of their opening four friendlies. He is likely to sample his first taste of Old Trafford as a player United player this weekend, and he will be hoping to start. In Wednesday's training session, Amorim was spotted putting his arm around his shoulder and having a word in his ear. The details of the conversation are, of course, unknown.",
      "For some, James Scanlon's omission from United's squad for the tour of the US was a bit of a surprise. He is already a senior international for Gibraltar and has been making good progress in United's academy. The attacker made the bench for United's Europa League win over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford back in March. He was involved in first-team training on Wednesday, but it remains to be seen if he will depart on loan before the transfer window closes.",
      "After making a positive first impression on his unofficial debut for United against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday, Bryan Mbeumo will be eyeing his first goal for the Reds as quickly as possible. The former Brentford man, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, was spotted in Wednesday's session getting some target practice under his belt.",
      "Who will start in midfield for United's Premier League opener against Arsenal in just over a week's time remains up for debate. Bruno Fernandes is likely to start in the engine room amid the presences of Cunha and Mbeumo, but who will start alongside him? Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are all currently battling it out to get the nod, and Ugarte and Casemiro were spotted pushing each other to the maximum in training."

      "United have made an opening offer £65.3million plus £8.7m in add-ons for the Slovenian international. Although Newcastle have made a higher bid, it is thought the striker is leaning towards a move to M16.",
      "If United are successful in their efforts, Sesko will become the new face of their forward line, supported by Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "In addition to wanting Sesko, it is also being widely reported that United are interested in signing Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba. According to The Athletic, United have 'made contact' with the Seagulls via intermediaries.",
      "Although attacking signings have rightfully taken priority for United so far this summer, a midfielder has been on their wish list throughout, and Baleba would be another statement signing if he were to move to Old Trafford.",
      "If United successfully lure Sesko and Baleba to M16 before the window shuts on September 1, head coach Ruben Amorim will have a very competitive squad to assemble his starting XI from.",
      "Despite the need for a new goalkeeper to come in and challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot, the Cameroonian expects to remain Amorim's first-choice goalkeeper this season.",
      "Leny Yoro was arguably United's best player on the recent pre-season tour of the US, producing a hat-trick of promising performances, meaning he should be a shoo-in at right-sided centre-back. Ayden Heaven is currently the obvious pick on the left of the back-three, but will face fierce competition from Lisandro Martinez once he returns from his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.",
      "In the middle, Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are battling it out to make it into Amorim's first choice XI, and both will believe they are worthy of winning the place. De Ligt, though, has been the more prominent figure in pre-season.",
      "As far as the wing-backs are concerned, Amad and Patrick Dorgu are obvious picks. Amad was United's most improved player by a country mile last season, adapting to Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system really well, and Dorgu has enjoyed a strong pre-season, providing the attacking thrust Amorim expects from his wing-backs.",
      "Following the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo, captain Bruno Fernandes is expected to be a regular operator in midfield this season. He frequently operated as a No.8 in the second half of last term and produced some of his best performances from a deeper position.",
      "Alongside him, Baleba, if successfully extracted from the Amex Stadium, will expect to go straight into Amorim's first-choice XI and add bite, energy and aggression to United's midfield. The Cameroonian, 21, is renowned for his energy, aggressive style of play and being able to progress the ball, meaning he provides exactly what United are looking for in a midfielder.",
      "Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro will all equally believe they are worthy of starting, but United would not splash out potentially north of £70m to put Baleba on the bench.",
      "As already documented, Mbeumo and Cunha are the leading candidates to occupy the two No.10 positions. The former, in the eyes of some, should be deployed as the right wing-back amid his history as a winger, but he scored 20 Premier League goals last season and should be played as close to the goal as possible.",
      "Cunha is a seasoned playmaker and well-versed as a No.10 in a three-at-the-back formation. He has enjoyed a solid pre-season and has offered flashes of what he will bring to the table.",
      "At the tip of the attack, Sesko will be a guaranteed starter. He is set to cost north of £70m and United are in desperate need of fresh blood up front.",
      "The 22-year-old should replace Rasmus Hojlund as United's chief marksman and be supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, who scored 35 Premier League goals between them for Wolves and Brentford last season.",
      "Dream United XI with two more signings: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Baleba, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",

      "Manchester United have been told they've made a mistake in pursuing Benjamin Sesko when a cheaper option was staring them in the face.",
      "The Red Devils look to have beaten Newcastle in the race for the 22-year-old striker's signature after he made clear Old Trafford was his preferred destination. The Magpies had a bid of £78million for the Slovenian accepted by RB Leipzig earlier this week.",
      "However, United are now close to landing their latest top target, with The Athletic reporting a deal worth an initial £66.4m plus £7.4m in add ons has now been agreed in principle and the player has been given permission to fly to England for his medical.",
      "Sesko's imminent arrival will be music to the ears of head coach Ruben Amorim, who has been chasing a new no. 9 for most of the transfer window.",
      "It follows United's lacklustre form in front of goal last season, which contributed to a disappointing league finish in 15th place. However, former Liverpool and Aston Villa striker Dean Saunders believes they missed a trick in not swooping for Darwin Nunez instead.",
      "The Uruguayan is close to completing his departure from Anfield after the reigning Premier League champions agreed a deal worth an initial £46m with around another £10m in add ons for him to move to the Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal, while a medical now awaits.",
      "Opting for Nunez over Sesko could therefore theoretically have saved United at least another £20m, should Liverpool have been willing to do business for the same price with their arch-rivals, and it's a chance Saunders reckons they should have taken.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, the ex-Wolves and Wrexham manager said: \"Nunez, he's up for grabs. Would you rather not have Nunez than Sesko and Gyokeres? They paid a lot of money for them, and I thought, 'he's up for grabs.' I would take a chance on him.",
      "\"He's got every finish in his locker, both feet, headers, he's gone round the keeper, he's slotted the keeper, he's chipped the keeper, he's scored from distance. We've seen him do every finish, but somehow he manages to conjure up a miss.",
      "\"I don't know how many times he hit the post and the crossbar last season. There's definitely a player in there, you look at him and think, 'What a handful he is to play against.' He scored a lot of goals for Benfica in his second season.\"",
      "He added: \"I wouldn't be surprised if Nunez goes somewhere else and scores 20 goals next season. You might get him on the cheap, you wouldn't pay £90million for him, but you might get him for £40million.\"",
      "Saunders made his bold statement despite Nunez often frustrating Liverpool fans with his inconsistency since joining the club from Benfica in 2022. The 26-year-old only managed five goals in the Premier League for Arne Slot's side last season.",
      "By comparison, Sesko scored 13 times in the Bundesliga last term and also netted on four occasions in the Champions League. Sesko will become the new face of their attacking unit, alongside summer recruits Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It's also being reported that the Red Devils are looking to bring in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, with contact already made with the Seagulls via intermediaries.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has been nominated for the 2025 Men's Ballon d'Or.",
      "The 28-year-old, who left United to sign for Napoli in a deal worth £25million last summer, enjoyed a memorable first season at the Italian outfit. Indeed, McTominay helped Antonio Conte's side win the Serie A title, scoring 12 goals in 34 league matches and winning the division's Most Valuable Player award in the process.",
      "McTominay scooped several accolades during his maiden campaign at Napoli, but his latest achievement could be up there as one of his greatest. The Scotland international has been named on the shortlist for this year's Ballon d'Or prize alongside 29 other players from around the world.",
      "Alongside McTominay, Paris Saint-Germain stars Ousmane Dembele, Desire Doue, Vitinha, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Joao Neves, Nuno Mendes, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Fabian Ruiz, Barcelona quartet Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Pedri, Robert Lewandowski, Real Madrid trio Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, Inter Milan duo Lautaro Martinez and Denzel Dumfries, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexis Mac Allister, Florian Wirtz, Arsenal duo Declan Rice and Viktor Gyokeres, Bayern Munich pair Harry Kane and Michael Olise, Chelsea's Cole Palmer, Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Borussia Dortmund's Serhou Guirassy are included.",
      "After coming through United's academy system, McTominay made his first-team debut in May 2017 during a Premier League game against Arsenal. That appeared to give him a springboard to go and feature more for Jose Mourinho, with the midfielder then playing 23 times in all competitions the following season.",
      "He continued to have a bit-part role in the United side before cementing himself as an integral figure in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad in 2019/20 and 2020/21, establishing himself as a consistent performer.",
      "However, McTominay's game time started to reduce following Erik ten Hag's appointment, and while he started to show some form at the end of his final season, the midfielder left to sign for Napoli last August.",
      "It was a decision that was questioned by some of the United fanbase, given the contribution and service he had given the club, but for him, he has flourished since quitting Old Trafford and found a new lease of life abroad.",
      "Reflecting on his first 12 months in Naples and winning the Serie A title, McTominay told Radio CRC in July: \"It was the best moment of my career. I couldn’t have dreamed of anything better.",
      "\"I did an interview four months ago and told the Neapolitans I wanted to bring them the league title, and through hard work – we did it.",
      "\"The target was very important, but now we have to focus on the new season and we have to do it again. Great teams and great players are always hungrier and I will do my best for this team. We have a lot of matches this year and a great group.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund delivered an interview to get his message across during Manchester United's pre-season tour in the United States.",
      "There has been uncertainty around Hojlund's future at Old Trafford throughout the summer, but he reiterated in a Stateside chat with journalists that he wants to stay.",
      "Speaking about his future in the US, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Those comments weren't a surprise, considering Hojlund also outlined his desire to stay in Manchester when he spoke to journalists while on international duty with Denmark in May.",
      "\"I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United,\" Hojlund said. \"I'm looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I'm fully dedicated to the project that's underway.\"",
      "The mixed zone comes alive when footballers have a message to convey. Asking players for a few minutes to chat as they leave the stadium can be a thankless task, but every now and then someone wants to get something off their chest.",
      "Hojlund's admission of wanting to stay at United is certainly not as juicy as Mohamed Salah speaking to Liverpool correspondents about his contract situation outside St Mary's Stadium last season, but it was still interesting to hear Hojlund is keen to fight for his place.",
      "However, despite Hojlund wanting to remain at the club, it's understood that the striker is ultimately resigned to leaving if United complete a deal to sign Benjamin Sekso this summer.",
      "United are prepared to make a loss on Hojlund, who was signed in a £72million deal from Atalanta in 2023, to help get their ducks in a row, meaning the Dane could be a victim of Sesko's arrival.",
      "In an ideal world, Hojlund would be kept to play second fiddle to Sesko. He would likely improve with less pressure on his shoulders and he is a better player than he was able to show last term.",
      "But United will take their summer spending to close to £200m if they secure Sesko and they must begin to offload sellable assets so they can comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules.",
      "Hojlund joined United for an up-front fee of £64m and is two years into a three-year contract, so his PSR value is calculated at £38.4m. United are understood to be open to selling Hojlund for £30m.",
      "Although Hojlund was incredibly disappointing last season, some supporters will be sympathetic because he could be forced out when he wants to stay.",
      "That will probably hurt Hojlund's confidence and he is still a young player. But football is a cut-throat business and United are not a charity. He wouldn't be in this situation if he'd scored more goals last season.",
      "Hojlund wants to stay, but the indicators suggest he will not get what he wants.",

      "Manchester United are confident Benjamin Sesko will opt for a move to Old Trafford over St James' Park, but anything can happen in the transfer window.",
      "Until that contract has been signed, there will be no temptation to tick 'sign a striker' off the summer to-do list, especially if there's sudden movement in Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak that has a knock-on effect on Newcastle's chase of Sesko.",
      "Sesko has earmarked this summer as his time move on from RB Leipzig after two years with the Bundesliga outfit, and his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has been keen to fill as many column inches as possible with his client's name.",
      "Speaking recently, Basanovic explained what Sesko would be looking for when choosing his next destination, saying: \"He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",
      "So, do United fit the bill? One of their summer recruits certainly seems to think so.",
      "Matheus Cunha joined Ruben Amorim at the first press conference on United's pre-season tour of America last month.",
      "During the press conference, Cunha was asked why he chose United, and he replied: \"It's an easy question to answer: United was always my dream club. When you can make your dreams come true, it's an easy decision.",
      "\"Ruben was a big part, he talked to me and showed how important I was to him so it was easy to make the choice.\"",
      "He was then asked how he intends to cope with the pressure of representing a club of United's stature. He replied: \"The pressure in this club is not pressure, it's a privilege. This is one of the biggest clubs in the world. When Ruben came to me and showed me the project I feel like it is a challenge I want for my career. United needs to be there and I want to be part of the process.\"",
      "Cunha's articulate responses show just what is on offer for any player of interest to United.",
      "The chance to be part of a project that hopes to take one of the biggest clubs in the world back to the summit of English football is one not to be missed, and in Amorim they have a manager with the character and charisma needed to spearhead said project.",

      "He was later joined by Bryan Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford for a fee that could rise to £71 million. The club have also signed young left-back Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno, although he is seen as one more for the future.",
      "United now appear to be closing in on their fourth new arrival. MEN Sport understands that the club are confident that RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko prefers a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle.",
      "The two clubs have been locked in a transfer battle for the Slovenia international over the last few days, but United look to have taken the lead in the race. Negotiations with Leipzig are ongoing with the club making a bid of €75 million (£65.3m) plus €10 million (£8.7m) in add-ons.",
      "It seems that United are already planning for their next transfer move once a deal for Sesko is wrapped up. The Athletic report that United are showing an interest in Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, and have made contact with the Seagulls over a possible move.",
      "Brighton are expected to put up a fight to keep their player this summer. He has three years remaining on his contract at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Should United push through with their interest, another transfer could help them provide the perfect gift for Baleba if he arrives at Old Trafford.",

      "The match will see more than 50,000 fans in attendance, with De Gea making his return to the club where he spent 12 years. He left United on a free transfer in the summer of 2023, and joined Fiorentina a year later.",

Despite fierce interest from Newcastle United, Sesko is understood to prefer a transfer to Old Trafford. And with Manchester United reportedly resuming discussions with Leipzig on Thursday, an agreement could soon be reached.",
      "Nevertheless, the 22-year-old might face a rude awakening should he arrive in the northwest, considering how Ruben Amorim has been swift to establish his authority since his own appointment last November.",
      "The Portuguese manager has introduced several fresh regulations since replacing Erik ten Hag, aiming to reverse United's fortunes. The primary rule that the 40-year-old enforced upon his arrival was prohibiting his coaching staff from delivering complicated instructions, believing that matters must be streamlined before being communicated.",
      "He also chose to prevent players from treating international breaks as vacation periods, following Marcus Rashford and Casemiro's trip to the United States in November for relaxation after being omitted from their respective national squads, reports the Mirror.",
      "Amorim commented on the alterations, saying: \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim has also outlawed food in the changing room on matchdays after stressing that he wants to focus on physical fitness within his squad, whilst the fourth rule that Amorim has implemented sees defeated teams in training sessions compelled to collect equipment used during the session.",
      "He's raised his expectations ahead of the new season, following a catastrophic Premier League campaign that witnessed the Red Devils finish 15th in the table. Diogo Dalot has emphasised that the club might not suit everyone at this time.",
      "Discussing Amorim's approach, the Portugal international said: \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.\"",

      "Alan Shearer admits it would be \"disappointing again from Newcastle\" if they miss out on Benjamin Sesko to Manchester United - particularly given their vastly superior 2024/25 campaign compared to their rivals.",
      "The Magpies enjoyed a remarkable year as Eddie Howe guided them to their first piece of silverware in over half a century while also securing Champions League qualification. United, meanwhile, suffered their worst-ever Premier League campaign, finishing 15th.",
      "Newcastle also claimed a commanding double victory over United - recording an aggregate scoreline of 6-1 across both fixtures - yet their most coveted summer transfer target appears to have indicated a preference for joining United.",
      "Sesko has continued to flourish at RB Leipzig and is regarded among Europe's finest young forwards. Newcastle moved first in their pursuit of the Slovenian, amid uncertainty over the future of Alexander Isak, but Ruben Amorim's side have now intervened and appear to have secured victory in the race.",
      "Shearer remains exasperated that another high-profile target seems destined to slip through Newcastle's fingers as they struggle to capitalise on one of the club's finest seasons, reports the Mirror.",
      "He told Betfair: \"It sounds as if Benjamin Sesko had two clubs to choose from in Newcastle and Man United. One that won a trophy last year and is now playing Champions League football this season - and one that didn't win anything, finished 15th and had a dreadful season.",
      "\"I understand that Man United are a huge football club, not so much a huge football team at this moment in time. I get it. I understand it. It looks as if, by all accounts, he prefers a move to Man United. It's disappointing again from Newcastle, another target it looks like they're going to miss out on and I said it about a week ago, it looks as if it's been a disastrous window for Newcastle.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will be looking to get more out of his squad in the upcoming campaign compared to last season. The 2024/25 campaign was one to forget for United.",
      "United have, however, been able to complete deals for key targets so far this window. Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have joined from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "United are also closing in on the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko with the club confident that they’ve beaten off competition from Newcastle United.",
      "The additions will add more quality to Amorim’s squad for the upcoming season. There is one other transfer that could make a huge difference to one area of United’s team.",
      "The club have reportedly made contact with Brighton and Hove Albion over a potential move for midfielder Carlos Baleba. The Cameroon international was a key player for the Seagulls last season, playing in the defensive midfield role.",
      "Brighton are not expected to let him go without a fight, but if United do manage to complete the transfer, then it will not only add more depth to the club’s midfield options, but his inclusion would also be a massive benefit to club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "If he signs, Baleba is most likely to replace Manuel Ugarte in the starting XI, meaning he will play alongside Fernandes in the two deeper midfield roles. Baleba’s strength in winning the ball back in the defensive midfield position will take pressure off Fernandes to do so much defensive work, and allow him to get on the ball more and control the game from the base of midfield, something that the club captain should excel at.",
      "But it’s not just Fernandes who will benefit from the arrival of Baleba. The 21-year-old also has a knack of being able to play long balls that break the line of the opposition’s defence.",
      "That will be a big help to the two attacking midfielders who, more often that not, will be Cunha and Mbeumo.",
      "Knowing that Baleba has the ability to play the balls in behind, both players will have the option of both running in behind as well as coming short for the ball and creating from there. It should therefore, make their movement more unpredictable for defenders and therefore harder to defend against.",
      "As with fernandes, Baleba’s defensive abilities will also benefit both Cunha and Mbeumo with the duo able to go and be creative, knowing that they’ve got the assurance of the midfielder behind them.",
      "Brighton have build a reputation for being tough negotiators when it comes to selling their players in the transfer window. Some reports suggest that the club will be looking for a fee of more than £100 million for the midfielder now.",
      "Unless there are big sales, that fee is likely to rule United out of the running. However, if the club can get Brighton to soften their stance, then it’s a transfer that will help to reach Amorim’s aim in the new season.",

      "Benjamin Sesko continues to train alone at RB Leipzig as he edges closer to a departure from Germany.",
      "Despite competition from Newcastle, Manchester United are confident Sesko prefers a move to Old Trafford this summer and talks are continuing with Leipzig to finalise a deal.",
      "United have bid €75million (£65.3m) plus €10m (£8.7m) in add-ons in an attempt to sign Sesko. Newcastle have offered a more lucrative package to Leipzig, but the player's preference is set to be decisive.",
      "Sesko has trained away from his teammates this week while talks over his future advance, and Leipzig confirmed on Wednesday morning that the 22-year-old was working individually again.",
      "In a short statement, Leipzig said: \"Wednesday squad update: Andrija Maksimovic is back in Leipzig, but is training individually today. Benjamin Sesko and Lukas Klostermann are also working individually.\"",
      "Speaking about his future in the US, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "United have spent a combined £127.5million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer, and completing a deal for Sesko would bring spending close to the £200m mark.",
      "If a transfer for Sesko is rubber-stamped, Ruben Amorim will have overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United mustered just 44 goals in the Premier League.",
      "United would also like to sign a midfielder before the end of the summer transfer window.",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba has already shown his world-class mentality and attitude off the back of transfer speculation in the past.",
      "United have spent well over £100million on new signings this summer and are closing in on another forward - Benjamin Sesko - for a fee of over £70m. But they are yet to sign a central midfielder, which is arguably one of the positions they need to improve in the most.",
      "That could soon change, however, with reports emerging on Wednesday night that United intermediaries had made contact with Brighton & Hove Albion in an effort to explore a deal for 21-year-old Cameroonian Baleba.",
      "The Red Devils appeared to have been handed a boost when journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that agreeing personal terms is not likely to be an issue with the player, who has three years left on his current deal at the AMEX Stadium.",
      "However, Brighton chief Paul Barber has since denied claims of United making an approach for the player, stating the transfer links are merely “speculation”.",
      "The Athletic also reported that Brighton do not intend to sanction a sale this summer and want to keep Baleba for another year. That could prove to be a huge blow to Ruben Amorim’s hopes of signing him, given Brighton’s reputation for being hard negotiators.",
      "It also seems unlikely at this stage that United will be able to raise the funds necessary to tempt Brighton into selling their star man.",
      "Baleba fits the profile of a midfielder Ineos are looking for at United, given his age, abilities and Premier League experience, which has led to plenty of admirers across Europe.",
      "The player has also displayed other qualities, such as a willingness to work hard and humility. He showed his class last year when he was asked about being linked with a transfer amid reported interest from the likes of Liverpool.",
      "When asked about talk of a potential move to other Premier League sides, a 20-year-old Baleba emphasised he was not focused on other clubs, instead stating he was eager to keep progressing and even hinted he may not be ready to be a star player at a top club.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I’ll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and for myself, to progress for the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it’s not something that worries me or gets me excited. I just need to work hard and keep a cool head.",
      "\"I don’t know if I’m going to be the star or the next big thing. For me, being the star is quite a lot. Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn’t do it for me.",
      "\"It’s not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "The Cameroon international signed for Brighton in 2023 after Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo left the club. Since then, he has been one of the standout central midfielders in the Premier League, making 77 appearances for the Seagulls in all competitions.",

      "Both players, 22 and 21 years of age respectively, are highly-rated talents plying their trade in the Bundesliga and Premier League. It therefore comes as no surprise to see this reflected in estimates of their transfer values.",
      "The CIES Football Observatory would place Sesko's transfer value anywhere between €107m (£93.4m) and €124m (£108.2m), and they also suggest Baleba to be worth between €75m (£65.4m) and €87m (£75.9m).",
      "Add the two players' values together and at the upper end of the range, United's targets come back at a combined value of €211m (£184.1m).",
      "Whether Sesko and Baleba could be considered value for money can therefore come down to a few factors, the most obvious being how much is paid in comparison to these benchmarks.",
      "And in Baleba's case, there is thought to be no release clause for the Cameroon international and it is speculated a deal could exceed £100m.",
      "This is already much higher than his CIES estimated value but combined with the Sesko bid, if that ends up successful, the two figures balance out under the £184m worth of combined transfer value.",

It emerged on Wednesday evening that the Red Devils had reached out to Brighton via intermediaries to suss the midfielder’s situation. Word hadn’t reached Brighton chief-exec Paul Barber by that point but it seems that the Seagulls would want something like £100million including add-ons, while United would open at £70million. That’s a big gap to bridge, especially when United don’t do this well and they are dealing with Brighton as reluctant sellers. Baleba, though, is keen to hear what United have to offer and his signing would be a bigger statement of intent than Sesko.",

      "“Wow. Huge money, £70m being spent,” he said on his Rio Presents YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Sesko over Watkins? Man Utd take Hojlund, Zirkzee risk again over what’s really important",
      "“Listen, he’s a young guy, been at Leipzig, playing, scoring goals. Last season, he played 45 games and scored 21 goals, six assists, so the guy knows where the back of the net is. That’s almost one goal every two games.",
      "“Yes, it’s a different league, it’s the Bundesliga, but he does play international football as well, he scores in international football and he knows where the net is.",
      "“A lot of people are going to go and suggest, ‘Oh, has he got the experience?’, and I was one of those guys in that camp going, ‘Do you know what? Where is the player that can actually show the young, inexperienced strikers that we have at the club how to do things? In times of need, who do they look to?’",
      "“He’s going to have to step up and be that guy. Can he do it? Yes, he can do it, he’s got huge potential.",
      "“But one of the things, as we’ve seen in recent years, our strikers, when they come in the door here, you’re not afforded a lot of time, there ain’t a great amount of patience and you’ve got to hit the ground running.”",
      "Ferdinand has also broken down what will be different about Man Utd’s attack should Sesko join Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha in moving to the Premier League giants.",
      "“What I would say is Manchester United scored 44 goals last season. They’ve now invested in three strikers at the top of the pitch that have between them 48 goals last season, so that’s four more than the whole Manchester United squad got last year so that’s a huge improvement in that sense,” Ferdinand added.",
      "“Two of those guys have played in the Premier League and scored goals here. Sesko, now, has to go and transform his form, his goals, his menacing play, at times, into the Premier League and that’s the big question.",
      "“What I would say is not only are the goals a step up, but I would say the mobility in the front areas now is something, as a defender, I’m looking at now and I’m thinking differently about Manchester United’s frontline.",
      "“I’m going to have a physical presence up there and I’m going to have a physical test from all three positions and I’ve got people that can run and move up there, they’re mobile. They’re the things I was asking for over the last couple of years up there so more of that.",
      "“You have to say the recruitment team have absolutely delivered in that department in terms of the mobility, the pace, the power.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",
      "According to reports, a ‘showdown’ for Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle United are ‘on site’ to hijack Manchester United on one condition.",
      "Manchester United have chosen Benjamin Sesko over Ollie Watkins. It’s a classic United decision, and we are very sceptical.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘scheduled new negotiations’ with RB Leipzig as they look to complete a deal for Benjamin Sesko."

      "Back in January, Chelsea were one of two clubs interested in the 21-year-old, but United’s valuation of £60m was deemed too high. His subsequent falling out with Ruben Amorim, as well as being one of five players to tell the club he wants to leave, has made him available for a much lower fee.",
      "A loan with an obligation to buy is also not ruled out, with Chelsea and United having done similar business with Jadon Sancho. In that instance, Chelsea opted to pay a £5m penalty rather than the £25m agreed fee to permanently sign the Dortmund winger.",
      "Manchester United have been looking to sell Garnacho all summer, and that desire will only increase with the expected arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",

      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",
      "As Manchester United close in on their new striker, who may prove to be the answer to their goalscoring woes but has more than a whiff of the Rasmus Hojlunds about him, David Ornstein revealed on Wednesday night that ‘contact’ has been made over a signing which will raise genuine concern among rivals that Amorim may actually have a passable football team to work with next season.",
      "While there can be no one missing piece to a puzzle which remains strewn across the living room floor, with a corner or two thought to have been eaten by the dog and others sucked up by the hoover, Carlos Baleba can be the centre-piece to bring the still disparate Manchester United together and grant supporters at least an idea of what a final image might look like.",
      "We’ve already questioned United’s linear transfer strategy this summer – the logic in completing one signing before moving onto the next rather than multi-tasking, to the point where Sesko has missed pre-season and any other additions look unlikely to join before the start of the campaign – but also, why this order when the midfield problem was so glaringly apparent under Amorim last term, having predated him for well over a decade.",
      "Ander Herrera, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Fred, Donny van de Beek, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro have been signed for a not-so-small fortune, with not one single person convinced Manuel Ugarte is any sort of answer for United as the latest in that string of frankly terrible signings to occupy one of the positions in their laughably unstable midfield pivot. If only they had used the Harry Maguire money on Declan Rice.",
      "Amorim could have been describing almost any game last season as he reflected on their 0-0 draw with Leeds a couple of weeks ago.",
      "“The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big. We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes operated in one of the deeper midfield roles in that game and again in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth last week, and Sesko’s imminent arrival will see the captain take up that position in the best United XI, or at least the XI featuring all of United’s best players, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo playing ahead of him and off Sesko.",
      "That’s currently unworkable role for him. We will have to endure/be treated to the same soft-centred Red Devils, laughably at risk of being counter-attacked upon so long as any of Casemiro, Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo are forced to do the donkey work they’e either incapable of or unsuited to in order to provide Fernandes with the license to remain United’s creator-in-chief in that position.",
      "Baleba has correctly been identified as one of very few players capable of granting him that freedom. The 20-year-old made 4.22 combined tackles and interceptions per 90 minutes in the Premier League last season, falling just short of Moises Caicedo (4.38), who made more in total than any midfielder other than Idrissa Gueye.",
      "United will no doubt be encouraged by Caicedo’s excellent second season for Chelsea, with the attraction of signing midfielders who have stood out for Brighton further enhanced by their continued excellence following moves to European giants, with Alexis Mac Allister a second outstanding exponent of the value in raiding the Amex following his key role in securing Liverpool their second Premier League title.",
      "United’s need for a dominant midfielder in no way makes their bid for a new striker unnecessary. No-one watching Hojlund toil last season will have any confidence in him being the No.9 who can score them 20+ goals per season.",
      "But we also think they could have muddled through without Sesko, using Cunha or Mbeumo as the central striker if need be, or just trusting they can provide enough of an uptick in creativity and quality in those inverted winger roles to bring either Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee along for the ride with them.",
      "Baleba arguably should have been their priority from the start of the transfer window, but absolutely should have been part of what will be a £200m spend from the destitute Manchester United by the time they get the Sesko deal is over the line.",
      "We’ve heard the sell-to-buy nonsense with regard to United throughout the transfer window and that’s the party line once again. ‘Unless the Old Trafford side are able to secure a raft of lucrative sales, it is improbable they can afford big-money recruits up front and in the number six role,’ says Ornstein.",
      "They will come close to their greatest-ever summer spend even without securing what we’ve been told all along were the necessary sales of members of the bomb squad, so we can’t be sure they don’t have an extra £90m lying around for Baleba.",
      "But if he is indeed beyond them as things stand, it’s not too late to pull out of a move for another young, unproven striker to join the two United have already – whom the manager isn’t convinced by anyway, very reasonably preferring the experience and surety of Ollie Watkins – in favour of a midfielder who Fabrizio Romano reports Amorim quite rightly sees as the “perfect” foil for Fernandes, with the “intensity” required to make United a serious football team this season.",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",

      "Manchester United have decided that Benjamin Sesko for £74million makes more sense than Ollie Watkins for £50million.",
      "As This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, we have our doubts.",
      "The overriding argument for Watkins is pretty compelling in our eyes: guaranteed goals. That is something United have notoriously lacked in recent seasons. They re-signed Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021 and he provided that for a year under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. He scored 24 goals in 38 games after Edinson Cavani bagged 17 in 39 the season before.",
      "Since their successful — albeit short-term — goalscoring exploits, United changed their striker recruitment philosophy to guys for the future. And how has that gone so far? Well…",
      "Rasmus Hojlund for £68million has been nothing short of a disaster. He needed 15 games to score his first Premier League goal, which did lead to a purple patch before an injury halted his goalscoring streak. Three in his last nine top-flight games of the season at least hinted he could pick up where he left off in 2024/25.",
      "He absolutely did not. The 22-year-old Dane registered four goals and zero assists in the Premier League last season. Joshua Zirkzee was even signed to unload some of the centre-forward burden, which didn’t help.",
      "Zirkzee was another inexperienced forward with no Premier League experience brought in by the club last summer. And just like with Hojlund, it’s proving to be a poor investment. Both players are young and can easily improve — even potentially become world-class — but these two case studies should be enough proof for United that no matter how appealing the prospect of signing Sesko is, they should have resisted the urge and gone all in on Watkins.",
      "There is an argument for why that’s not the direction United should have taken — and we’ll get to that — but how Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team haven’t used the Hojlund and Zirkzee evidence to ensure they don’t make the same mistake is startling. Ronaldo and Cavani are important here as well. The former was signed when he was 36 and Cavani was 33. Yet they were reliable options in front of goal, something Hojlund and Zirkzee have failed to become.",
      "Ronaldo and Cavani are not the only strikers older than Watkins (29) signed by the Red Devils who thrived at Old Trafford. There’s also Zlatan Ibrahimovic — the club’s second-best post-Sir Alex Ferguson signing — Robin van Persie, and, a long time ago, Teddy Sheringham.",
      "The fact Watkins turns 30 in December means absolutely nothing in a footballing sense. Players keep themselves in the sort of shape these days that means he could still be flying for United six years from now. But, no. In classic United fashion, they’ve gone for the flashy new toy — whose upside is huge, we know — but who also has an incredible, potentially Hojlund-esque downside.",

      "The main issue with Watkins appears to be his resale value. In that respect, the best-case scenario is that Watkins performs at a high level for a few years and Saudi Arabia come calling with a huge offer that the player wants to pursue. The worst-case scenario is that he’s pants from day one and United are stuck with another high-earning, underperforming, big-money flop. Having watched Watkins in the Premier League for the last five years, that is very unlikely. And yes, so unlikely that we are completely writing it off, which we haven’t done with the prospect of Sesko being another Hojlund (or only a little bit better).",
      "‘Resale value’ can be disregarded when the player pays you back on the pitch, and that’s what Watkins would do at Old Trafford. His worst Premier League goal return came in 2021/22, when he scored 11. That was also the only season Watkins missed more than one game across a top-flight campaign. He played 38 out of 38 last term!",
      "It’s a Manchester United decision that’s just…very Manchester United, but there is some logic to it.",
      "United’s transfer philosophy changes every summer, and the mood this year is to only sign players who really want to play for the club. Sesko fits the bill, while Watkins wasn’t aggressively pushing for the move. That’s the biggest factor for United, we think.",
      "And then there were the selling clubs. Everything we said about Watkins could be worth nothing if Aston Villa have zero intention to sell the player. RB Leipzig, on the other hand, have every intention to sell Sesko — but it was always going to happen on their terms.",
      "MORE: Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko: Which striker should Man Utd sign?",
      "Arsenal reportedly preferred Sesko to new signing Viktor Gyokeres but were put off by the German club’s whopping valuation of the 22-year-old Slovenian: 90 million euros.",
      "That’s around £78.5m, and it’s what Newcastle United offered Leipzig for the player. United, knowing he only wanted them, went a little under that — offering £74m. Reports suggest that offer has already been increased to match the Magpies’, such is the Red Devils’ desire to get Sesko through the door and ready for their Premier League opener against Arsenal.",
      "The fact Leipzig are open to negotiations, and most importantly, Sesko is desperate to join, holds more weight in the United boardroom than a guaranteed success in Watkins — even if that’s what Ruben Amorim’s side are desperately crying out for.",
      "And we might be blinded by Hojlund and Zirkzee’s performances. They don’t necessarily mean that every young attacker signed by United will turn out rubbish — even if nearly all of their major signings over the last 12 years have been just that. The trend has to break at some point. Sesko certainly has the potential and current ability to be the trend-breaker.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United believe personal terms “won’t be an issue” as they target Brighton star Carlos Baleba, who is to make a ‘bold move’.",
      "So far this summer, Man Utd have completed three summer signings, investing around £130m to land Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Diego Leon.",
      "In recent weeks, the Red Devils have been focused on landing a striker and have settled on Benjamin Sesko as their preferred target after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Reports on Wednesday revealed Sesko is edging closer to a move to Old Trafford after choosing Man Utd over Newcastle United, with Fabrizio Romano reporting that a ‘full agreement’ has been reached.",
      "The Red Devils are hoping that the possible exits of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Rasmus Hojlund can raise funds as they will remain in the market for further additions after landing Sesko.",
      "It has been widely reported that their next priority is to sign a new defensive midfielder and it emerged on Wednesday that they are plotting an audacious move for Baleba.",
      "READ: Top 10 wingers available this summer: Man Utd trio, Grealish, Arsenal targets Rodrygo, Williams…",
      "Baleba is considered one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League and it would be a major coup if Man Utd landed him as possible moves to Liverpool and Manchester City have previously been mentioned.",
      "Respected reporter David Ornstein revealed to The Athletic that the Red Devils have made ‘contact’ with Brighton over Baleba.",
      "He added:",
      "‘The 21-year-old, who has three years left on his Brighton contract, is emerging as one of the most highly-rated players in his position and Brighton do not intend to sanction a sale this summer.",
      "‘But interest is building and United are among the many suitors, which has now been relayed through go-betweens.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano provided a further update on this situation on Thursday morning, confirming Baleba’s stance and why a deal could be “very difficult”.",
      "He said on X: “Carlos Baleba didn’t close doors to Man United after direct contact with his camp.",
      "“Manchester United believe agreeing terms with Baleba terms won’t be an issue but club-to-club deal, considered very difficult.",
      "“Brighton want to keep Baleba this summer & won’t make it easy.”",
      "Twitter account Indykaila News has previously been renowned for being a parody account, but they now have a ‘team of five respected reporters’, have amassed over 540k followers on X and have recently been credited by Ornstein on Baleba.",
      "They revealed an ‘exclusive’ on Baleba on Wednesday night, claiming ‘Brighton want £90m + £10m in add-ons for Baleba, while Man Utd are ‘looking at him with a valuation of around £70m total’.",
      "Though the ‘main part’ of this update is that Baleba is said to be willing to make a ‘bold move’ to force a switch to Man Utd. They added: ‘Now, the main part: Baleba himself is reportedly planning to step in and ask Brighton to lower that asking price. It’s a bold move, but will they actually listen?",
      "‘If he can convince them, it could change the whole saga for #MUFC.’",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",
      "Carlos Baleba’s stance on move to Manchester United has been revealed as the Brighton CEO responds to the Red Devils ‘contact’, with his price tag set.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed there are “two reasons” behind the delay on Chelsea’s move for RB Leipzig star Xavi Simons.",

While there is no club-to-club agreement yet, the situation is moving in that direction.’",
      "United’s push to sign a new No.9 has put Hojlund’s future at the club in doubt, with the club bosses now said to be more than open to his sale.",
      "After scoring in the pre-season win over Bournemouth last week, Hojlund said: “I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused, and then obviously we’ll see what happens.”",
      "“I think my plan is very clear, and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I’m still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I’m only 22.",
      "“Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I’ve learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I’m starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "“Now it’s just about for me to sharpen myself, and I’ve done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.”",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Sources close to the Denmark international concede that if Hojlund is unwanted it could lift his game but, ultimately, he will have to seek a move before the transfer deadline on September 1.’",
      "Ex-Red Devils assistant Rene Meulensteen believes his former side should have instead pushed to sign Ollie Watkins.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Manchester United’s bid for Benjamin Sesko is basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund. If he scores in the first three or four games and hits the ground running then he could be the answer for the club, but there’s a chance that won’t happen.",
      "“If you look at Hojlund, he joined Atalanta and performed well alongside the rest of the team and then joined United.  The same can be said for Sesko – the Bundesliga is a very different league to the Premier League, so he’ll need to adapt. Has Sesko got potential? 100%, but he’s still young and developing and he isn’t the finished article.”",
      "Meulensteen added: “I look at someone like Ollie Watkins who may be available. He’s a hard-working player with similar features to Sesko, except that he already has Premier League experience which is priceless. I think Sesko would probably cost more than Watkins too.",
      "“Why doesn’t the club bring in Watkins and allow the coaches to work closely with Hojlund to allow him to develop? It’s a waste of an investment otherwise – they paid close to £80m for him and they’re in danger of selling him for less than half of that unless he develops.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has raised two concerns with Manchester United target Benjamin Sesko, but he has backed the 22-year-old to shine for the Red Devils.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down.",
      "According to reports, a ‘showdown’ for Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle United are ‘on site’ to hijack Manchester United on one condition.",
      "Manchester United have chosen Benjamin Sesko over Ollie Watkins. It’s a classic United decision, and we are very sceptical."

      "Including three Manchester United outcasts and several Arsenal targets, these are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window.",
      "And here are the best available strikers. And attacking midfielders. Oh, and centre-backs. Plus defensive midfielders.",
      "10) Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nManchester United need to sell Sancho and he certainly is an available winger. Juventus have been linked with a while but it’s all very quiet regarding the ex-Borussia Dortmund man’s future.",
      "",
      "9) Antony (Manchester United)\nThe Red Devils have managed to offload Marcus Rashford, who dropped out of this ranking after agreeing a move to Barcelona.",
      "Antony impressed during a productive loan spell at Real Betis in the second half of last season. The Spanish club want him permanently, and the Brazilian is keen on the move. They’re a great fit.",
      "",
      "8) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nWe are three for three for United players on the chopping block. Garnacho is reportedly valued at a staggering £60million — a figure that feels wildly inflated for a player who underperformed last season and comes with baggage. But at just 21 years old, he still holds plenty of promise.",
      "Garnacho wasn’t alone in struggling at Old Trafford; very few besides Bruno Fernandes stood out. But unless Sir Jim Ratcliffe lowers his valuation, United might be forced to keep or loan him out, risking a repeat of this summer’s dilemma in 2026.",
      "",
      "7) Maghnes Akliouche (AS Monaco)\nThe 23-year-old had a solid campaign with Monaco, regiestering five goals and 10 assists in Ligue 1. He’s earned six caps for France, which is no small feat, and was recently linked with a move to Arsenal. That interest seems to have cooled after the Gunners picked up Noni Madueke.",
      "Still, Akliouche is available…for a steep £70million. He’s not cheap, but he’s fantastic.",
      "",
      "6) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Tyler Dibling, while Gabriel Martinelli’s availability is up for debate (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed have been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was so exciting to watch at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "5) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale — meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is underwhelming. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "4) Malick Fofana (Lyon)\nLyon might be safe from relegation, but they’re still resigned to losing Belgian winger Fofana this summer. Saying that, there’s no immediate rush on Fofana’s part to leave.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a bid accepted and sold Anthony Elanga to Newcastle United for £55million, but Fofana wants Champions League football. Chelsea are an option but have already signed Liam Delap, Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro.",
      "What is clear is that, at just 20 years old, he is one of the most intriguing prospects on the market this summer.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nWilliams has signed a new long-term contract at Bilbao, but the release clause still exists. Oh, and by ‘long-term’, we mean 10 f***ing years.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out — they’ve welcomed Gittens, Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer — but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How did they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight in January?",
      "With Grealish likely off and Jeremy Doku not fully convincing, Man City could come calling too. Liverpool would also make sense if they don’t sign Alexander Isak.",
      "Leao’s performance in the Nations League final for Portugal would have convinced a few potential suitors.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act. Even after signing Madueke from Chelsea, we shouldn’t rule the Gunners out.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, is expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club — and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",

      "Man Utd have agreed a deal to sign RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko ahead of rivals Newcastle; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Thursday 7 August 2025 16:00, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest ended after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Manchester United are now close to signing the Slovenian forward, having beaten Newcastle to his signature.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who look set to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",

      "In a game which featured a first Manchester United appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford, Everton twice came from behind to claim their first point of the tournament.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said the Premier League Summer Series has helped bring Manchester United's players together but rued \"laziness\" in their performance against Everton.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way. Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "On Manchester United's summer transfer activity, he added: \"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little bit more, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in perfect condition, physically, but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes was critical of Man Utd's \"lazy\" display in their 2-2 Premier League Summer Series draw with Everton before calling for further reinforcements in the transfer window.",
      "Fernandes' first-half penalty, following a foul by James Tarkowski on Amad Diallo, was cancelled out by Iliman Ndiaye, who finished emphatically from Idrissa Gueye's cross after Vitalii Mykolenko had robbed Manuel Ugarte.",

      "When asked about the success of Man Utd's tour to America and the display against Everton, Fernandes said: \"It's been positive. It's been positive to be together to create a bond between the players.",
      "\"It's been important for developing how we want to play and getting the new players involved too.",
      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way,\" The United skipper added. \"Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",

      "The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.",
      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",
      "\"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
