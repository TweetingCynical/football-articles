      "Manchester United have been linked with several deals ahead of the January transfer window. The Red Devils will be forming plans to strengthen their squad as Ruben Amorim’s team push for a Champions League spot.",
      "The club can assert their top four ambitions with a home win over Bournemouth on Monday night. United have lost just one of their last nine games, following their 4-1 victory at Wolves.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been consistently linked with joining Napoli due to his limited game time at United. The 20-year-old midfielder saw a loan request rejected in the summer but has yet to start a league game this term.",
      "Napoli have Mainoo’s former teammate Scott McTominay and current United loanee Rasmus Hojlund within their squad. The Italian club’s sporting director Giovanni Manna has responded to speculation that Mainoo could be the next player to join from Old Trafford as Napoli battle an injury crisis.",
      "“He is a player who has been linked to Napoli since August, also for his age, his potential, and the transfer opportunity,” Manna told Sky Sport Italia. “This team is doing well, it is consolidated.",
      "“We have some important absences right now, but sooner or later the lads will return, strong and determined. We have to make the right evaluations, so we’ll see how things progress along the way.”",
      "Midfielders Billy Gilmour, Stanislav Lobotka, Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Kevin De Bruyne were all sidelined for Napoli’s Champions League clash with Benfica on Wednesday. Antonio Conte's side suffered a 2-0 defeat, with McTominay being criticised for his performance.",
      "Manchester United have announced a £13.3million operating profit in their first quarter financial results. Last year, the club had built up a £6.9m loss over the same period.",
      "The financial change is due to reduced costs, following Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s financial review after purchasing a minority stake in 2024. United were found to have the highest number of employees across the Premier League, which led to mass redundancies to bring costs down. The latest figures show United’s total revenue was £140.3m, despite their absence from European competition this season.",
      "United CEO Omar Berrada said: “These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",
      "\"The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long-term.",
      "\"That has helped us to invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and women’s Super League respectively.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford has admitted he only ever wanted to play for Manchester United as a child, but is now appreciative of the new experiences Barcelona is bringing him. Rashford joined Barca on a season-long loan in July after falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim at United and is enjoying life at a new club.",
      "The England striker was placed in the ‘bomb squad’ at United alongside fellow unwanted players Antony, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho. He was the first player to secure a move elsewhere, landing on his feet at Barca, the club he had angled for all summer.",
      "The 28-year-old has settled well in Hansi Flick’s side, contributing six goals and 11 assists in 21 games so far. Barcelona have the option of making the move permanent for €35million (£30.3m) and, having fallen out with Amorim, Rashford has made it clear he would like that to become a reality.",
      "His mindset was shown in an answer during an interview with BBC Sport. Asked whether he would’ve thought when he was younger that he’d have played for two big clubs like United and Barca, he replied: “It’s crazy. My dream when I was young was to just play for United. And then you don’t know what’s going to happen in your life.",
      "“I feel very lucky and fortunate that this is one of the places that I’ve been able to play for. Because it’s a huge club, a club I’ve always admired as a young boy – my favourite club outside of England. It’s amazing football that they play here, like lots of football fans know. To be able to wear this shirt is a tremendous feeling.”",
      "Rashford spoke in glowing terms about his new home in Catalonia, where he is learning Spanish and trying to throw himself into the culture. “It's different, but it's a great learning curve for me,” he said.",
      "“And even little things, I've not done it completely yet, but learning the language and stuff like that, learning the culture, it's all enjoyable for me.”",
      "He added: “It's a new language of football. I've always been, like many people in the world, an admirer of Spanish football. To play for the biggest club in Spain is a huge honour. I'm looking forward to playing more games here, just doing my best and try to help the team to win.”",
      "Rashford has been thriving on the pressure attached to playing for Barcelona. He came off the bench and provided an assist for Jules Kounde in the 2-1 comeback win over Frankfurt on Tuesday, earning rave reviews from the Spanish media. Barca are four points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and are favourites for the title following five straight league wins.",

      "Manchester United have completed the signing of a 13-year-old prospect who previously had trials with Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace. The defender, known only as Socrates, has been praised for his resilience after being rewarded with his move to the Red Devils.",
      "United have been prioritising youth recruitment under Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership. Last season they brought in Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi from Arsenal's academy, while a reluctance to bring in Sergio Ramos suggests high-earning players over the age of 30 are a thing of the past.",
      "\"From ELA ➝ Signing for one of the biggest club in the world,\" wrote West London-based youth football organisation Elite London Academy. \"Today we congratulate Socrates on officially signing for Manchester United. @manutd",
      "\"Socrates has been with us for five years — five years of development, hard work and belief. From the moment he joined Elite London Academy, you could see he had something special: technically gifted, intelligent on the ball, brave in duels, and always hungry to learn.",
      "\"Along his journey, we organised trials for him at Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace. He completed full trials at these clubs but these did not result in registration. Arguably, missed opportunities for the clubs. But what makes Socrates different is how he responded. He didn’t sulk. He didn’t lose confidence. He showed resilience, maturity and a mindset far beyond his age.\"",
      "According to ELA's post, Socrates started out as a winger but now plays as a left-sided centre-back. He is said to have turned down a deal at another club because of the school opportunity offered, and is said to be continuing his education at \"a highly academic and selective school\" in Manchester.",
      "\"Off the pitch, he’s exactly the type of boy every academy wants: Humble, well-mannered, intelligent, respectful and driven,\" the academy added. \"And behind him is a family who supports him in all the right ways — patient, positive, and trusting the process.\"",
      "United have also been showing their academy talents that there is a pathway to the first team. Heaven and Obi have both played for the senior side under head coach Ruben Amorim, while others - including 15-year-old prodigy JJ Gabriel - have trained with Amorim's squad while waiting for that first opportunity.",
      "Gabriel, who has 10 goals in 11 games for United's Under-18s, became the club's youngest ever FA Youth Cup scorer this week. His goal against Peterborough proved to be the winner and showed why United are so intent on keeping him at the club amid reports of transfer interest from Barcelona.",

      "Manchester United will face some significant transfer decisions in the January window, with a handful of players dealing with uncertain futures at the club.",
      "The Red Devils had a busy summer with several high-profile arrivals, including Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. Despite these additions, Ruben Amorim's side have endured a mixed start to the campaign, sitting just outside the top six with seven wins from their 15 Premier League games so far.",
      "Some players have featured more regularly than others, and both Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were among those tipped to depart in the summer but ultimately stayed put. Now, as the January window approaches, speculation surrounding their futures has resurfaced once again.",
      "The pair are relatively high earners within the squad, with Capology claiming Zirkzee earns in the region of £5.5million per year. Mainoo, meanwhile, is said to earn roughly £1.3million annually.",
      "However, the article also states that Zirkzee himself is determined to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford. He has made a greater impact in recent weeks, including scoring an equaliser against Crystal Palace at the end of last month before United went on to win the game 2-1.",
      "As for Mainoo, his future appears to be leaning away from the Manchester club and towards a move abroad. The young midfielder had been linked with a switch to Serie A champions Napoli in the summer before the deal was reportedly blocked by United.",
      "The latest update from the Daily Mail says clubs are willing to sign Mainoo on loan in January if United are now open to a deal. The report also adds that Napoli remains the player's preference after his initial request to join them was rejected.",
      "It has been claimed the final decision will rest with United's hierarchy, led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. Amorim will also have a say, though the Red Devils are expected to target a replacement if any departure is sanctioned.",
      "The United boss made his stance on January exits clear at the end of last month, noting he will not push either player towards the exit door. Instead, Amorim will make decisions based on what is best for the football club as a whole.",
      "\"The first thing is that the club comes first, so we have to think about the club and the team, and then everything can happen,\" the Portuguese coach explained in a press conference a few weeks ago. \"I was a football player, I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation, so I don't know what is going to happen.\"",

      "The BBC has revealed why former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay was overlooked for the Sports Personality of the Year award, explaining that an expert panel came to a collective agreement on the final shortlist. The 29-year-old has emerged as one of Europe's most impressive performers following his switch to Napoli last summer.",
      "McTominay netted 12 goals for Antonio Conte's team as they claimed the Serie A crown, smashing Denis Law's 63-year-old scoring record and earning Serie A Player of the Season honours for the previous campaign. He made history as the first Scottish player to claim the prize at the Gran Galà del Calcio ceremony this month.",
      "The 29-year-old played a crucial role in Scotland's World Cup qualification and secured 18th place on the Ballon d'Or shortlist, becoming the first Scot to feature since Ally McCoist in 1987.",
      "Despite his remarkable displays, the BBC has excluded McTominay from their final shortlist for this year's Sports Personality of the Year honour.",
      "When pressed for a comprehensive explanation regarding McTominay's omission, a BBC representative informed the Scottish Express: \"A wide range of contenders were reviewed and debated by an expert industry panel, who reached a consensus on the final shortlist.\"",
      "The United academy product was the hero as Scotland overcame Denmark to secure World Cup qualification for the first time since 1998, with his spectacular strike earning calls for a Puskas Award nomination. Luke Littler and Rory McIlroy have both secured spots on the final shortlist following extraordinary campaigns in their respective disciplines.",
      "England Lionesses stars Hannah Hampton and Chloe Kelly, rugby union ace Ellie Kildunne and Formula 1 world champion Lando Norris complete the remaining nominees.",
      "Sports journalist Henry Winter raised eyebrows over Scott McTominay's absence from the lineup, posting on social media: \"Scott McTominay a surprise omission from #SPOTY short-list?\".",
      "\"Won Scudetto, voted Serie A Player of the Year, nominated for Ballon d'Or, helped Scotland qualify for World Cup, scored vital/spectacular goal against Denmark that's surely a Puskas Awards contender. Amazing year.\"",
      "The final selection hasn't gone down well with everyone, as numerous supporters responded with 'great point' whilst branding his exclusion as 'harsh'. One supporter commented: \"It's terrible but not surprising,\" whilst another chimed in: \"It is a farce.\"",
      "A third remarked: \"I agree, what an outstanding year he's had, he should have been included in the SPOTY shortlist,\" whilst another suggested: \"Unsure why they need to limit the list? I'd [say] there are others that deserve the recognition, McTominay a case in point, then expand the list. All of the nominees deserve to be there, so [there] should be more to choose from. Lando or Luke to win for me, but that's my preference.\"",
      "Following the announcement of the shortlist, Alex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport, said: \"This has been a breath-taking year for sport, driven by athletes whose performances belong in the history books.",
      "\"Each one has delivered moments of pure brilliance that have defined 2025. It's been incredible to watch, and I can't wait to honour their achievements, and to see who the nation chooses as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2025.\"",
      "Teenage sensation Littler, just 18, clinched the world number one spot in darts and is now gearing up to defend his World Championship crown, whilst McIlroy etched his name into golfing folklore as only the sixth player ever to secure a grand slam across all four major tournaments.",
      "The Northern Irishman ultimately triumphed at Augusta before playing a pivotal role in Europe's nail-biting Ryder Cup triumph against the Americans. Meanwhile, Hampton and Kelly both shone brightly as England successfully defended their European Championship title.",
      "Kildunne emerged as one of England's most dazzling talents, bagging five tries as the Red Roses captured the Women's Rugby World Cup on home turf.",
      "Norris joined an elite group as the 11th British driver to claim a Formula 1 world championship, securing the title with a third-place finish at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.",

      "Spain legend Sergio Ramos has been linked with a shock move to Manchester United after leaving Mexico side Monterrey. It isn't the first time the 39-year-old has been mentioned in connection with an Old Trafford switch, though the latest rumours appear wide of the mark.",
      "Ramos returned to boyhood club Sevilla in 2023 after spells with Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, but lasted just one season. He moved to Mexico for Monterrey's 2025 campaign, playing at the Club World Cup, but has left this month after not extending his contract.",
      "If Ramos is to prolong his career, it's unclear where the next chapter will take place. According to ESPN, United remain focused on signing younger players and have not held any talks over a move for the veteran.",
      "It was a different story a decade ago, though. Back then, the Red Devils were serious about a move for Ramos, and he would later shed light on how close he was to making the jump to the Premier League.",
      "\"I stayed where I should have stayed, Real Madrid, but I was indeed close to playing for United,\" Ramos said in 2023. He was speaking just months after returning to Sevilla and recognised his career could have ended up taking a different path.",
      "\"It was not to be, but I do keep that admiration for the club, to the Premier League and the players, because the rhythm of play, the pace is different, and it's a league we can all learn a great deal from, all of us,\" he added. \"So that was not meant to be. I was glad to stay in Madrid, and now I'm glad to be in Sevilla.\"",
      "Wherever Ramos ends up next, he leaves Monterrey after sharing an emotional farewell message. \"Saying goodbye is never easy,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"It ends a stage that started full of excitement in February and that has allowed me to discover a country, a city, a football... and that leaves me many new experiences and, above all, many friends.",
      "\"I will forever be proud to have worn the Rayados captain bracelet, to have led the team in the first Club World Cup in its new format, to have battled in the Closure, in the Opening, in the Leagues Cup, in the Concacaf Champions Cup... and to have bravely defended the Steel Giant by your side in all the matches we have played at home.",
      "\"Left it all on and off the court so I can perform at my best. 34 games, more than 3,000 minutes, 8 goals and so many emotions that can't be described in numbers. To the club, to my dear colleagues, to the technical bodies, to the employees, to everyone, thank you. And above all, thank you, fans, who have brought me your warmth and affection from the first moment I stepped into the city. I will always remember with nostalgia this stage of my career and I will always proudly say 'Arriba el Monterrey!'\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt, Benjamin Sesko and Harry Maguire were nowhere to be seen during Manchester United's training session at Carrington on Thursday. With United set to face Bournemouth in the Premier League on Monday, Ruben Amorim is expected to provide clarity on team news at his pre-match press conference.",
      "Discussing De Ligt's injury following the Wolves match, Amorim remained cautious about his return: \"I don't know, sometimes you have an idea then you have to see day by day. I'm not going to say when he is coming back.\"",
      "The Dutch defender has been sidelined for the West Ham and Wolves fixtures due to his knock. While De Ligt wasn't involved in Thursday's training, he was present at Carrington fulfilling external media obligations.",
      "The Bournemouth fixture was initially targeted as a potential comeback date for Sesko following his injury against Tottenham on November 8. On November 21, Amorim offered an update, stating: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don't know how long, but it's not that serious. We have to be careful with him.\"",
      "Maguire sustained a hamstring injury during the 2-2 stalemate against Tottenham. Last week, Amorim confirmed the England defender was \"still out\" with the issue.",
      "The absence of senior players paved the way for Shea Lacey, Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson to participate in the training session. Lacey has been included in the last four Premier League matchday squads.",
      "Manager Amorim has suggested that academy players will play a crucial role when he loses Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations next week.",
      "Amorim stated: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Speaking about Lacey's progress, Amorim added: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",

      "To the layman, they do not seem overly ‘robust’, and financial types on social media were not exactly bowled over by the numbers. Neither was the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "There was an operating profit of £13.3million compared to a £6.9m loss in the first quarter of the last financial year, but that was mainly down to player sales, most notably somehow getting Chelsea to hand over £40m for Alejandro Garnacho. Chelsea have come to the rescue of a few clubs when it comes to balancing the books. Ask Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "But Manchester United should not be a club that relies heavily on player sales. The figures might be robust but there is no doubt a lack of European football will have an impact on this year’s numbers.",
      "The total revenue for the quarter - £140.3m, which is slightly down, year on year - still shows the financial strength of the club. That is still a projected annual revenue of around £650m. They are still big numbers. But what will jar with supporters is the club’s net debt, now at a record high of £749.2m.",
      "And what will grate even more is that the original £481m debt from the Glazers’ leveraged takeover is still there. It is has not been reduced.",
      "A financial and footballing powerhouse such as United can shoulder such debt but the fact the Glazers have since taken out tens and tens of millions of pounds in dividends and share sales is an insult to supporters. According to the renowned football finance expert Kieran Maguire, since the Glazers took over in 2005, the accumulated pre-tax losses total £531m and the cumulative net interest costs are in excess of £1bn.",
      "But the Glazers have been ok, don’t worry about that. Perhaps they will start paying themselves dividends again, now there is a profit on the table.",
      "And that would cheer up those long-serving office staff who have been culled by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and those left who have had their free lunches taken away. But for all the debt and the bad taste left by Sir Jim’s ruthless cost-cutting, the figures do again show that United remain a financial and commercial powerhouse in European football.",
      "They just need to re-establish themselves as a powerhouse on the field of play. They just need to get back to the top table, to Premier League and Champions League contention.",
      "Berrada says a ‘sustainably lower cost base’ and ‘a more streamlined, effective organisation’ has helped the club “invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and women’s Super League respectively.” As if that is some sort of boast.",
      "But while this latest financial announcement is unlikely to turn heads on or off the pitch, it does once again show that if Ruben Amorim can work the miracle, United can become a perennial force once again. That, though, is a very big 'if'.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker have made it clear Mason Greenwood should not try and make a comeback to England. The 24-year-old netted twice in Marseille's 3-2 win against Union Saint-Gilloise in the Champions League.",
      "Back in November, reports emerged suggesting Greenwood harboured ambitions of re-joining the England setup, having turned down a call-up from Jamaica's national side. Three months earlier, he'd obtained Jamaican citizenship and a passport, but his refusal to answer the Reggae Boyz's call hints he's still holding out for a Three Lions return.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel has already made it clear he won't be selecting Greenwood. Assessing his situation, Shearer and Lineker believe the right decision for Greenwood is to carry on plying his trade overseas and turn out for Jamaica instead.",
      "On the Rest is Football podcast, Lineker said: \"I want to talk about Mason Greenwood. He's been doing brilliantly since. I know there's a lot of controversy around him and he had that awfulness of his situation.",
      "\"He's gone abroad and he's performing, as he did last season, but this season at Marseille he's performing really well. Another two goals yesterday, excellent finishes.\"",
      "Lineker added: \"I think he's decided he is not going to try and play for England and that he is going to play for Jamaica, which is another option for him. Do you think that makes sense? It would be difficult for him here wouldn't it?\"",
      "Shearer replied: \"I think it was the right decision for him to go to another country. He had to settle down and just try and go out and play football.",
      "\"I don't think anybody ever questioned his ability. He was a very good football player with a lot of talent. I think we all knew that.\"",
      "Greenwood's international career with England was limited to just one cap, earned in 2020 during a UEFA Nations League fixture against Iceland.",
      "That same international break saw him and Phil Foden disciplined and sent home after both players allegedly breached Icelandic Coronavirus restrictions by meeting two women in a separate area of the Three Lions' hotel.",
      "Both footballers were required to apologise, with then England boss Gareth Southgate labelling them as \"naive.\"",
      "Whilst Greenwood received a call-up for England's Euro 2020 squad, an injury shortly before the tournament ruled him out of the competition.",
      "This season, Greenwood has netted 13 goals and provided four assists in 20 appearances across all competitions for the French club. He recently gave his first interview since leaving United, where he praised his manager Roberto De Zerbi, the ex-Brighton and Hove Albion chief who now manages Marseille.",
      "Greenwood told Telefoot: \"I'm in a really good place thanks to the coach and my team-mates. I feel good and I hope to improve, to win more awards this season.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi? He's the brains of the team, the architect of our game. He helps me understand football much better, he helps me improve every day.\"",

      "Following his acquisition of a minority stake at Old Trafford in 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe initiated a review of club operations, leading to widespread redundancies across various departments to cut costs.",
      "United disclosed their most recent financial figures on Thursday, verifying that the club operated at a profit for the first financial quarter. United's CEO, Omar Berrada, responded: \"These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay endured a difficult reunion with Jose Mourinho on Wednesday night. The Napoli star watched his team suffer a 2-0 defeat to Benfica in Lisbon, dealing a significant blow to the Italian side's Champions League hopes.",
      "Since departing Old Trafford in 2024, McTominay has been one of Antonio Conte's most impressive performers. Yet he struggled to replicate his typical form as the reigning Serie A champions suffered their third successive European away defeat.",
      "Napoli manager Antonio Conte criticised the short recovery time following his team's victory over Juventus on Sunday, pointing out that Benfica had enjoyed an extra two days' rest. However, Mourinho dismissed Conte's argument after the final whistle.",
      "\"Saying Benfica were fresher physically feels like an excuse,\" he said. \"We interpreted the game well, I decided to play Ivanovic rather than Pavlidis upfront and that changed the way we attack.\"",
      "Mourinho added: \"The players showed character and intelligence, a Benfica mentality, which means when you are having the biggest difficulty, you step up. We knew that without a win here, we were out, but now that we have six points, we're in the running.\"",
      "The outcome leaves Napoli 23rd, narrowly within the play-off places, while Benfica trail by a point. Italian media have offered their verdicts on McTominay's display against his former United manager.",
      "Italian publication Gazzetta dello Sport detailed how McTominay had contributed to both of Benfica's goals. Richard Rios' opener resulted from a rebound involving McTominay and Benfica striker Ivanovic, while he also failed to track his man before Leandro Barreiro made it 2-0.",
      "The Scotland international was \"constantly forced to chase\" as part of a weary Napoli side, who were \"exhausted, lacking pace and ideas\". The criticism was partly attributed to the team's demanding fixture list.",
      "However, the match report delivered a scathing assessment of McTominay and United loanee Rasmus Hojlund's display: \"So McTominay, usually the driving force, is his own double, and Hojlund, the Old Lady's killer, is never seen.\"",
      "The match report from Corriere dello Sport also emphasised McTominay's defensive frailties during the match. It read: \"The protagonist is accustomed to being on the cover, but for different reasons.\"",
      "It was noted that the former United midfielder \"timidly leaps into the box, without rising with his usual vehemence and physical prowess\", before being involved in Rios' opening goal. For the second strike, McTominay was \"chasing\" Rios before his assist doubled the scoreline.",
      "Summarising Napoli's lacklustre showing, the match report said: \"Batteries were too low, there was little will to fight, and there was little hunger.\"",
      "Regarding McTominay's impact, Corriere dello Sport stated that \"the Scotsman was never seen, nor was Napoli\".",

The midfielder has been in hot goal-scoring form with two goals in his last three games with United rising to sixth in the Premier League following their 4-1 win against Wolves.",
      "Amorim was full of praise for the Englishman after his performance at the Molineux, saying: \"He can defend, he can attack, is really the quality that when he touched the ball is really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him.\"",
      "It's been quite the career resurgence for Mason Mount after an injury-plagued first two seasons at Old Trafford. The ex-Chelsea star, who cost United £60m in the summer of 2023, had made just 31 league appearances for the Red Devils prior to the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "But Mount has sent a clear message to his boss that he is over the hump when it comes to injuries and ready to be a regular starter as he finds a way to start paying back his price tag.",
      "The 26-year-old is once again adding goals to his game, having found the net three times in his last four league starts.",
      "Most recently netting in United's 4-1 rout of Wolves on Monday, Mount's growing importance to the team spells for surprising reading. In the seven league games he's started this season, United have won five of them while drawing and losing one each.",
      "Compared to the six games where he was used as a substitute, United won just two, drawn three and lost one. United are earning 2.3 points per game when Mount starts which would see the club hypothetically top of the table with 34 points if he had started all 15 matches.",
      "A repeat of Manchester United's 2023 pre-season clash against Wrexham could be on the cards for next summer. According to Mail Sport, the two clubs have had discussions about a potential match in Europe.",
      "Should an agreement on the friendly come to fruition, it is expected to take place to be in Scandinavia due to the mass popularity both clubs have in that region. Nothing has yet to be confirmed due to the clubs having to navigate their pre-season schedules around the World Cup next year which is being hosted in North America.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Their first clash was a feisty one which Wrexham ran out 3-1 winners against what was a youthful United side. Dan Gore was sent off in the second half while Paul Mullin suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs following a challenge from goalkeeper Nathan Bishop who issued an apology to the striker after the game.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel has smashed a Red Devils’ record amid speculation about his Old Trafford future. The 15-year-old has made quite the impression within the club’s youth ranks alongside Kai Rooney and Jacey Carrick.",
      "Barcelona have been credited with an interest in the youngster following an eye-catching start to the season. But it appears that Gabriel is remaining focused on his current role with United. The talented teenager was included in United’s side for their FA Youth Cup clash against Peterborough United and ended up being key to victory, scoring the only goal of the game.",
      "Gabriel's strike also means he is now the youngest-ever player to have scored in the FA Youth Cup at just 15 years of age. It also saw him extend a scintillating start to the campaign.",
      "Gabriel now has 11 goals in just 12 games, having also chalked up a hat-trick against Liverpool’s under-18s earlier this campaign. United have already been making a concerted effort to retain his services.",
      "Jason Wilcox wants to tie him down to a further two years at least, while Ruben Amorim has also held a meeting with the youngster. Speaking about Gabriel earlier this season, the United boss said: \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy.",
      "\"We try to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty and pace of our training.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Away from Amorim, Gabriel has also met former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Sharing a picture of the pair on Instagram, he wrote: “Great honour to meet legend Sir Alex Ferguson.”",
      "While United are keen to tie the youngster down to a new deal, he could potentially be set to link up with a fellow Red Devils academy graduate should he move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is currently in the middle of a loan spell at the Camp Nou, having fallen down the pecking order under Amorim.",
      "The forward has scored six goals and provided 11 assists so far in all competitions. Barcelona have an option in the agreement to sign the 28-year-old permanently for a fee of £26m.",

The Dutch international has scored just eight goals in 58 appearances for United since arriving from Bologna in the summer of 2024.",
      "He's fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim following Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo's arrival at the club. Zirkzee has been repeatedly linked with a return to Italy, with AS Roma the latest club said to be keen on his signature.",
      "However, recent injuries to Sesko and Cunha opened the door for Zirzkee to feature in Amorim's starting XI. He started and scored in the comeback win at Crystal Palace, his first goal in the Premier League for United this season.",
      "It was after that win, former Premier League striker Troy Deeney revealed he thinks he'd do a better job than Zirkzee, despite being retired for two years. Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"It’s really poor again from Zirkzee.",
      "\"I’ve been retired for two years – Man United give me six weeks and a third of what he’s doing and I’m probably sure I can do better.",
      "\"It is embarrassing watching him play at this moment in time. He just looks like a lost soul, an absolute lost soul.\"",
      "Nevertheless, that goal at Palace took Deeney by surprise and said: \"He’s got no right to score that. I’m questioning the ‘keeper, but it’s a wonderful finish. We’ve been giving him grief, and rightly so, but that’s a massive moment in his career.",
      "\"I’m flabbergasted that he’s done that. It’s not even the fact that he scored the goal, it’s the fact he’s shown you nothing in this game so far that you would even get a shot off.",
      "\"But to even have that level of self-assuredness to even take the shot. The confidence of it is frightening.\"",
      "The United boss was also full of praise for how Zirkzee took his goal against the Eagles. Amorim said: “It’s so important for the strikers to score goals. He’s not playing many minutes but the way he responds in the second-half is so important.",
      "\"It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",

      "Mount made it two goals from his last three appearances in the 4-1 win over Wolves this past Monday, with the 26-year-old named player of the match. Just a few days prior, England discovered their World Cup fate with Tuchel's side to face Croatia, Ghana and Panama in the group stages.",
      "A number of spots in his squad are up for grabs with the most competition almost certainly in the forward areas. Mount will be one of those hoping to make the cut, though it seems Tuchel is not that keen on him for one key reason.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, the differing styles of Amorim and the Three Lions head coach is an issue, with conversations between the two camps giving off the feeling that a call-up is ‘highly unlikely’. It is further stated that regardless of whether or not he continues impressing, Tuchel is not expected to look in Mount's direction.",
      "Such a stance could significantly derail Mount's hopes of getting back into the England squad for next summer's tournament in the United States.",
      "Back in November, The Sun had reported that it was the Manchester United head coach's 'special plan' for the upcoming months as he views Mount as England's most underrated player.",
      "It was also claimed at the time that Mount is viewed by Amorim as a \"super talent\" with that on full display against Wolves earlier this week in what was arguably his most impressive outing for United.",
      "The United boss thinks there is 'no other' England player who can offer Tuchel what Mount can. However, despite helping him get back to his best, with three goals in his last seven Premier League games, Amorim's plan is set to bomb with Mount expected to be snubbed again, having last played for his country at the 2022 World Cup.",
      "Even though Amorim may be fighting a losing battle against Tuchel, more prominent minutes for Mount are very likely with the Portuguese tactician blown away by his performance at Molineux.",
      "Amorim said: \"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me.\"",
      "\"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "Bruno Fernandes (x2) and Bryan Mbeumo were also on target in the victory, with United moving up sixth as a result of those three points.",
      "United's next game is against Bournemouth, and it is their third Monday evening clash since late November, with the win over Crystal Palace the only Premier League clash of their last five not played under the lights.",

      "Scott McTominay has seen a remarkable turnaround in his career since swapping Manchester United for Napoli. The Scottish star has been amassing trophies, accolades and praise following his £25.7million transfer 18 months ago.",
      "The 29-year-old midfielder had an exceptional season last year, guiding the Italian giants to Serie A glory. McTominay will be back on the pitch for Napoli on Wednesday night as the Italian champions take on Benfica in the Champions League league phase.",
      "While his potential was always evident at the Red Devils, it's in Italy where McTominay has truly come into his own, netting 12 league goals in 34 matches and playing a key role in Napoli's second Scudetto win in three years. His outstanding performances earned him the Serie A MVP title and he also helped Scotland qualify for their first World Cup since 1998 last month.",
      "But it's not just on the pitch where McTominay is making waves. From his stunning girlfriend, his popularity among the locals, to his appreciation for Italian culture, we delve deeper into the Scotland international's life in Naples.",
      "McTominay's glamorous girlfriend Cam Reading has been christened the 'Queen of Italy' by some media outlets. The model caused quite a stir in a sheer dress when McTominay was named Serie A Player of the Year earlier this month.",
      "Reading commanded attention in a stunning see-through black gown, accessorised with a sparkling necklace. McTominay's girlfriend has settled seamlessly into Neapolitan life, where she resides alongside the club's newest icon.",
      "She even took to social media to express her pride following his successful evening at the awards ceremony, showcasing some of her Italian.",
      "Taking to Instagram, she wrote: \"Gran Gala del Calcio, Scott walked away with two awards and I walked away even prouder of the man he is...dedicated, hardworking and always striving for more. Ti amo.\"",
      "Last year the couple were snapped along the Amalfi coast in a snap shared by Reading on her Instagram. She revealed that she and McTominay had \"fallen in love with Italy\".",
      "Former Scotland manager Gordon Strachan previously lauded McTominay for achieving \"god-like\" standing at Napoli. He remains a crucial component of Antonio Conte's squad, with the club presently embroiled in an early-season championship battle alongside rivals Inter and Milan at the summit of Serie A.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, Strachan commended McTominay for establishing a new beginning in Italy. He said: \"Sometimes it's about finding the right team for you as a player.",
      "\"Maybe that's the tip. I think for a long time, I think Scott McTominay was looked upon as the new kind of Stephen Fletcher who could pop in and help and all the rest of it.",
      "\"He didn't really have his own identity at Manchester United, I think when he went to Napoli, he found his own identity.\"",
      "He continued: \"He's transformed into arguably one of Italy's finest players this year, if not the very best. I was in Sorrento recently and that man is now revered like a deity and he achieved it through his own efforts. Regardless of what you might say about managers, you still have to deliver personally. So I believe he's excelled brilliantly.\"",
      "Whilst McTominay has seamlessly adjusted to Serie A football on the field, it seems he's also completely immersed himself in the lifestyle beyond the pitch. From sipping espresso to savouring fresh tomatoes, the Scotsman has been effusive about his existence in Naples.",
      "A source within Napoli disclosed that McTominay has developed a taste for Italian coffee. Speaking to Gazzetta della Sport, veteran Napoli staff member Tommaso Starace revealed: \"McTominay was sceptical at first; now he averages two in the morning with me.\"",
      "McTominay also confessed earlier this year about his unexpected passion for tomatoes, despite previously avoiding the fruit. In an April conversation with The Athletic, he explained: \"Oh my goodness, the tomatoes. I never ate them at home, they're just red water.",
      "\"Here, they actually taste like tomatoes. Now I eat them as a snack. I eat all the vegetables, all of the fruits. It is all so fresh. It's incredible.\"",
      "There's no question that McTominay took a massive gamble when he exchanged Old Trafford for the Diego Armando Maradona stadium, but he's convinced the entire adventure of residing overseas has genuinely pushed him beyond his comfort zone. McTominay's stellar performances have earned him a mural in the heart of Naples.",
      "Speaking about the affection he receives from the locals, he said: \"The people in Naples are incredible. They're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation and that inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care.\"",

      "Erling Haaland has admitted he's a proper football fanatic in his downtime, though his girlfriend Isabel Haugseng Johansen seems to have had enough of the sport taking over their relationship. The striker opened up about his passion for the game during a chat with Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker on The Rest Is Football podcast, recalling how he tuned into Manchester United's 1-1 draw with West Ham last Thursday.",
      "When quizzed about his viewing habits, the 25-year-old said: \"Yeah, I'm a football fan, so I watch all kinds of football.",
      "\"Actually, yesterday, we were eating dinner, and I checked if there were any games. Man Utd, West Ham is playing. Let's put it on. My missus said, 'I'm so sick of football. We watch it all the time.' And I'm like, 'Yeah, that's the reason why we are sitting here.'\"",
      "The revelation offers a fascinating glimpse into Haaland's world away from his goal-scoring exploits for Manchester City. Haaland is currently dating 21-year-old Isabel, with the couple first crossing paths back in Norway when the striker was playing for Bryne FK – his maiden club.",
      "It's rather revealing that Haaland's own partner complained about football being on 'all the time', highlighting just how consumed the striker is by the beautiful game.",
      "Whilst this might appear typical for a professional footballer, that's not necessarily the reality, as some players treat it purely as work and don't maintain such keen interest.",
      "Arsenal's Ben White serves as perhaps the most striking example, with the Premier League star admitting that he doesn't particularly care for watching the sport and staying abreast of the stories surrounding it.",
      "Haaland, meanwhile, clearly does and that may well contribute to the obsession he harbours with netting goals and smashing records at every opportunity.",
      "\"This is what it's like if you play with Messi or Ronaldo, his influence is so big,\" said Pep Guardiola last month when he was talking about the quality of Haaland.",
      "\"You see the numbers of that guy? Of course he's that level. Messi and Ronaldo have done it for 15 years, but this is the level. The first goal, the way he shoots the ball, it's like, 'I am going to score.'",
      "\"He has that hunger. It's top. I said how incredibly coachable and manageable he is. I am tough sometimes with Haaland, but he is open-minded. He lives for the goals and sometimes the pressure cannot sustain 90 minutes, but that's normal.\"",
      "With 144 goals to his name in 166 City appearances so far, Haaland must be keenly aware of the records that lie ahead of him, having become so attuned to the narratives of football and the Premier League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "His face (and physique) are instantly recognisable to billions. However, even A-list status couldn't prevent a hilarious mix-up involving an overly optimistic and rather inebriated influencer hoping to score some social media points with a celebrity selfie.",
      "In a tale that's sure to bruise the former Madrid player's ego, a Lithuanian influencer mistook a random bloke for the real CR7.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Goda Problema shared a video of herself enjoying a drink at a lively club with a man she mistook for the footballing legend.",
      "She captioned the post: \"Yesterday I got so drunk I thought I met Cristiano Ronaldo\" – and the video she took on the night is as funny as it sounds.",
      "The random man plays along – despite bearing no resemblance to the real Ronaldo.",
      "At one point, he seems to convince himself that he might indeed be the ex-Manchester United star because he starts referring to the influencer as 'Georgina', the name of Cristiano's partner.",
      "Incredibly, the power of social media managed to identify the opportunistic Milanese chap who fancied a night pretending to be Ronaldo.",
      "Stefano Boscolo, a motorcycling enthusiast and whiskey fan, even left a comment on the Instagram post.",
      "He quipped: \"It was a pleasure to meet you, see you in Milan! Greetings from Ronaldo of Temu\". The comment has since garnered thousands of likes and comments.",
      "Predictably, the internet didn't miss the opportunity to poke fun at both the influencer and Stefano. One user jibed: \"Ronaldo SHEIN version.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another chimed in that he had \"no shame\" in playing along with the mix-up.",
      "However, there were some who seemed convinced this could be the beginning of a romantic liaison between the faux CR7 and the Lithuanian influencer.",
      "'He's hot who cares\", one user penned, rather bluntly. Meanwhile, another slightly more starry-eyed Instagrammer added \"Please marry him!\"",
      "The fact that Ronaldo isn't actually out partying in Milan should have been a significant clue. That's because he's still an active footballer!",
      "He plays as a forward for Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr and has secured a new deal until 2027. Unfortunately, he'll likely have to postpone the wild nights out until after that contract is up.",

      "Manchester United have announced their first quarter financial results, revealing an operating profit of £13.3m compared to a £6.9m loss from the same period last year, as a result of reduced costs.",
      "After acquiring a minority stake at Old Trafford in 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe launched a review into club operations and mass redundancies were made across departments to lower costs.",
      "Ratcliffe's review found United had the highest employee count in the Premier League.",
      "United released their latest financial figures on Thursday, confirming that the club operated in profit for the first financial quarter. United's CEO, Omar Berrada, reacted: “These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",
      "\"The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long-term.",
      "\"That has helped us to invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and women’s Super League respectively.”",
      "The figures also revealed total revenues of £140.3 million and an adjusted EBITDA of £26.9 million.",
      "However, there has been a deduction of 2 per cent in revenues, reflecting the absence of European broadcast revenues, and two fewer home games in the quarter compared with last year.",
      "The club believe the first quarter figures show they are making progress in improving their financial position, but sources have conceded that more hard work and discipline are required for long-term sustainability.",
      "Ruben Amorim was backed to spend £215m (not including add-ons) in the summer transfer window, adding Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens to his squad.",

      "Speaking about De Ligt's injury after Wolves, Amorim said about his return: \"I don't know, sometimes you have an idea then you have to see day by day. I'm not going to say when he is coming back.”",
      "De Ligt was absent against West Ham and Wolves due to his knock. Although the Dutchman did not participate in training on Thursday, he was present at Carrington and conducted external media duties.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sesko will return to face Bournemouth. The striker's recovery from a knee injury is understood to have gone well, which hints that he could be involved.",
      "The Bournemouth game was identified as a realistic return date for Sesko when he suffered the issue against Tottenham on November 8. Amorim provided an update on November 21, saying: \"He is going to stay a few weeks out. I don’t know how long, but it’s not that serious. We have to be careful with him.\"",
      "Maguire picked up an injury, damaging his hamstring, in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham. Speaking last week, Amorim confirmed the English international was \"still out\" with the problem.",
      "The senior absentees opened the door for Shea Lacey, Jack Fletcher and Tyler Fredricson to be involved with the training session. Lacey has been named in the last four Premier League matchday squads.",
      "Amorim has hinted that players from United's academy will be important when he loses Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations next week.",
      "Amorim said: \"I think it's going to be hard, but then that is the good thing of the experience, we lived so many limitations last year, because we changed in January, and we didn't bring the players.",
      "\"And then we had the injury of Amad for four months, all these things, so we are prepared for that, even it will be hard for us, but we have a different baggage to deal with that. And again, I think guys like Jack Fletcher, Shea, a lot of guys, they can step up, and we can send at the same time a message to everyone here, in the academy, that this is the future. But we are going to struggle and we have to be prepared for that.\"",
      "Amorim added of Lacey's development: \"I'm really happy with him. I think he struggled a little bit with injuries, they did a very good job balancing his body, you can sense that he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here, they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared, because our trainings are hard, at Premier League games, with the pressure it's harder, so they need to be ready.\"",

      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",

      "United are braced for further sponsorship uncertainty, though, because their sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology will expire at the end of the season.",

      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in and sponsoring the sleeves.",
      "The expiry of the DXC deal means United are in discussions to find a new sleeve sponsor and training kit sponsor.",

      "Speaking at a charity event, as relayed by Mundo Deportivo, Rashford said: \"All my teammates welcomed me warmly, and I also felt very comfortable in the city. It’s the first time I’ve lived away from Manchester, but I’m already starting to feel at home.\"",
      "Manchester United's retail, merchandising, apparel and product licensing revenue was £37.2 million in the first quarter financial figures, writes Steve Railston.",
      "Anti-Glazer fans have encouraged supporters not to buy official United merchandise, but the club have banked an increase of £3.7m from the same period last year.",
      "United announced their latest financial figures on Thursday afternoon. Club sources have said the increased retail and merchandise revenue is due to the impact of a full three months’ trading under their new ecommerce model, compared to only one month in the prior year quarter.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Ahead of the January transfer window, shock links with out-of-contract Sergio Ramos have emerged in recent days.",
      "However, journalist Fabrizio Romano has issued an update on the defender and offered clarity on United's apparent interest.",
      "Speaking to GiveMeSport, Ramano plainly said: \"I’m not aware of any contact between Sergio Ramos and Man United now.\"",
      "Of course, United's recruitment strategy of late has veered away from high-profile older signings, such as the move for Casemiro in the summer of 2022. Instead, they have prioritised young and exciting talent, such as Benjamin Sesko and Leny Yoro in recent windows.",
      "According to Italian reporter Luca Cerchione, Kobbie Mainoo is set to join Napoli when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Talks between United and Napoli have accelerated significantly over the past few days, with one source claiming the deal is almost complete and that it will be a sale rather than a six-month loan.",
      "Manchester United are preparing a £87.5million bid for Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, according to a report from Fijaches. It's a move that is said to be led by manager Rúben Amorim and INEOS sporting director Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "Sources close to Old Trafford describe Wharton as being Amorim's dream signing. Palace are aware of growing interest across Europe but are under no pressure to sell.",
      "Ruben Amorim was without Harry Maguire, Benjamin Sesko and Matthijs de Ligt for Manchester United training on Thursday.",
      "The latter has missed United's last two games while muscular problems have resulted in Sesko and Maguire being absent since mid-November.",
      "The hope was that all three could return to some degree for Monday's Premier League clash against Bournemouth, but that now appears to be in jeopardy due to their team training absence just a few days before that game.",
      "Former Manchester United duo Jose Mourinho and Scott McTominay enjoyed reuniting on Wednesday evening as Napoli met Benfica in the Champions League.",
      "It has not been an easy to start to life back in Portugal for Mourinho but their fortunes changed against the Italian champions as they won 2-0. Mourinho also has a souvenir from the victory, which he revealed to the press after the game.",
      "In a press conference, he said: \"The bag is mine. It’s McTominay’s shirt. I gave him his debut. I benched Pogba to let him play [at Manchester United]. The least he could do was give me the shirt.\"",
      "Manchester United have announced their first quarter financial results.",
      "It has been revealed that they have made an operating profit of £13.3m, after reducing reduced costs with that shown as a great move in comparison to a £6.9m loss from the same period last year",
      "Omar Berrada, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “These robust financial results reflect the resilience of Manchester United as we make strong progress in our transformation of the club.",
      "\"The difficult decisions we have made in the past year have resulted in a sustainably lower cost base and a more streamlined, effective organisation equipped to drive the club towards improved sporting and commercial performance over the long-term.",
      "\"That has helped us to invest in our men’s and women’s teams, sitting in sixth and third places in the Premier League and women’s Super League respectively.”",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Napoli are among 10 clubs keen on signing Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United.",
      "He has also claimed that any deal depends on what happens at AFCON with Ruben Amorim not wanting to lose any more first-team players.",
      "The midfielder has rarely featured this season after being denied a temporary move away from Old Trafford this past summer.",
      "Diego Leon's future is up in the air ahead of the January transfer window. Leon has exclusively played in Manchester United academy fixtures this season and staff have been pleased with his progress.",
      "That does not necessarily mean Leon will receive an appropriate loan offer in the January window. The youngster has played for the Under-21s and interest may be thin on the ground.",
      "An alternative to Sergio Ramos appears to be Elche centre-back David Affengruber.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, he has been identified as a potential target for next year and the long-term partner to Leny Yoro. Their report adds that a January move appears unlikely but United meeting his €30million (£26.2m) asking price could change that stance.",
      "He is seen as a potential cost-effective winter addition to the club.",
      "A major transfer claim has been made by Spanish radio network Cadena SER with their latest report stating that Manchester United have submitted a bid to sign Sergio Ramos in the January transfer window.",
      "The Real Madrid legend is currently playing his football in Mexico with Monterrey but is expected to leave next month. It had already been stated that United would be looking at Ramos as a short-term defensive addition due to limited finances.",
      "It would be quite the coup from United to sign the veteran defender but it does seem quite unlikely given where Ruben Amorim's side need to strengthen.",
      "Manchester United have been credited with an interest in young midfielder Ederson Castillo by Ecuadorian outlet Bolavip.",
      "The 17-year-old, who currently plays his football for L.D.U Quito in his home country, was reportedly scouted by United recently.",
      "Their report adds that the teenager can only join a European club once he joins 18 and that United have the financial means to pull off the deal and convincing him to join will not be difficult.",
      "Manchester United academy star JJ Gabriel scored what all will hope is the first of many goals at Old Trafford on Tuesday.",
      "The 15-year-old starred in his side's FA Youth Cup victory over Peterborough United, but things could have played out a lot differently.",
      "According to the Athletic, an exit for Gabriel appeared inevitable before an emergency meeting led by Matt Hargreaves stepped in, and Jason Wilcox changed things as the club’s pathway and plans was outlined.",
      "Gabriel and his family ultimately made the decision to stay and it is fair to say United were pleased by that outcome. Their report states that the belief is he is the best 2010-born player which has seen him earn comparisons to Phil Foden.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes has also made an effort to engage with the teenager when he has trained with the first-team squad.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee looks set to remain at Manchester United for the remainder of the 2025/26 despite transfer links over a return to Serie A.",
      "Injuries have seen Zirkzee handed more minutes over the last few weeks with that likely to continue as Bryan Mbeumo and Amad depart for AFCON.",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has issued a Kobbie Mainoo transfer verdict, when speaking to Football Italia.",
      "He is a player who has been linked to Napoli since August, also for his age, his potential, and the transfer opportunity.",
      "We have some important absences right now, but sooner or later the lads will return, strong and determined. We have to make the right evaluations, so we’ll see how things progress along the way.",
      "Kicking things off with the player largely expected to dominate January transfer window rumours in Antoine Semenyo.",
      "The Bournemouth star has a £65million release clause in his contract with Manchester United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham and Arsenal among the Premier League clubs on high alert after his excellent start to the 2025/26 season.",
      "United and Spurs were interested this past summer but he opted to sign a new deal with the Cherries and it seems as though he remains unconvinced on a switch to the latter. According to The Sun, he is 'hesitant' to join Tottenham and would much prefer a move to north London rivals Arsenal.",
      "As a boyhood Gunner, that stance is perhaps no surprise but it does provide a mixed update for United as it could result in one less team being in the race but a clear favourite for Semenyo if Mikel Arteta's side opt to make a play.",
      "Hello and welcome to MEN Sport's Manchester United transfer news live blog!",
      "Updates on Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, Antoine Semenyo and much more will arrive throughout the day as the January window edges closer.",

      "Sam Mather is set to leave Manchester United in the January window. Mather missed out on an exit in the summer window due to talks collapsing with Turkish club Kayserispor, but his situation will be revisited.",
      "Mather, 21, is keen to leave United in an effort to kickstart his career in the professional game, and he is attracting interest from clubs in Turkey, Germany and Greece ahead of January.",
      "Discussions have taken place regarding the youngster's future, and United are willing to make concessions to allow Mather to leave as early as possible after his summer move collapsed.",
      "The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward. United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather's options for an exit were limited following the closure of the European transfer windows, which led to talks taking place with UAE club Al Wahda FC at the end of September.",
      "United insisted on including a buy-back clause during discussions to sell Mather, which is common practice for departures from the academy, but the UAE club did not agree.",
      "Mather was forced to deal with the disappointment of missing out on a fresh start. He has continued to train with the first-team and has made appearances in four academy fixtures to keep ticking over.",
      "The winger scored a brace against Norwich in his first appearance of the campaign, but he has outgrown academy football and is hungry to leave his boyhood club to further his career.",
      "Mather has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role.",
      "His contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027.",

      "The president of Lecce has spoken of his pride at the clubs sale of Patrick Dorgu to Manchester United. The Denmark international arrived at Old Trafford in the previous January transfer and his ability to play as a wing-back was considered crucial for Ruben Amorims 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Since joining, there have been ups and downs for the 21-year-old. He was sent off on his first start at home, although his running power and energy have frequently given the team a solid outlet on the left win.",
      "While Dorgu continues to find his feet in Manchester, his former club are content with how the transfer has played out, even though they did lose a key player.",
      "Speaking to Tuttomercatoweb (h/t Get Football News Italy), Saverio Sticchi Damiani highlighted the sales of Dorgu and former Barcelona and France defender Samuel Umtiti as examples of the clubs talent identification working.",
      "\"Umtiti was an extraordinary operation, a world champion who gave a lot to our club, but that of Dorgu represents the Lecce model 360 degrees,\" he said.",
      "\"Taken from the youth sector of a Danish team, he spent a year in the Primavera and half a season in Serie A, and then was sold to Manchester United for 38 million. It is a symbol of the quality of our club. And doing business with Manchester United is an additional source of pride.\"",
      "Dorgu has yet to fully establish himself as a regular for the Red Devils. Hes made 14 appearances so far this season in the Premier League, with seven of those coming as starts and the other seven coming off the bench.",
      "Diogo Dalot has been his main competition for a left wing-back spot and has started the last three games since the 1-0 loss to Everton at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United defender Ayden Heaven is currently one of the club's most promising young prospects, and he has enjoyed a rapid rise since his move from Arsenal earlier this year.",
      "The teenager spent time in both West Ham and Arsenal's youth academies before signing for United for a nominal fee back in February. Upon his arrival, Heaven agreed a four-and-a-half-year deal with the Red Devils and immediately stepped into the first-team squad.",
      "Since joining the club, the 19-year-old has made 11 appearances for United and registered one assist, which came in the Premier League win over Brighton in October. Heaven has started two Premier League games under Ruben Amorim this term, including the recent 4-1 victory over Wolves, where he featured in a back three alongside Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Heaven became the second highly rated youngster to join United from Arsenal within a four-month period, with forward Chido Obi-Martin making the same switch, albeit into United’s academy, towards the end of 2024. But there was a clear reason Arsenal were prepared to sanction the sale of such a bright prospect, and it comes down to another emerging name in their academy.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Arsenal's 16-year-old defender Marli Salmon has been likened to current first-team star William Saliba. The north London club believe he is their next major talent after Max Dowman, and that he has a clear pathway into the senior squad.",
      "In midweek, Salmon came off the bench in the Gunners’ Champions League win over Club Brugge, with Mikel Arteta short of defensive options due to a pile-up of injuries. The report emphasises that Heaven’s departure to United was accepted internally at the Emirates because of the belief they have in Salmon.",
      "United, of course, are the beneficiaries of that belief, securing a highly promising player in Heaven. One who is already earning Amorim’s trust in key Premier League matches.",
      "After the Wolves win, having featured in back-to-back league games, Heaven said post-match: \"There's so many great defenders at this club that he's trusting you to be at the middle of that defence.",
      "\"He [Amorim] is trusting me a lot. I feel like I'm working hard every day in training and I'm showing he can trust me in the games that I'm playing.",
      "\"I thought I was a good player but I knew that I first had to gain the trust of the manager and slowly I know I'm doing that. I feel like I'm doing well at the moment, but I've just got to keep working.\"",

      "Bittar added that it “would not be ideal” to interrupt his current season with a move away.",

      "Mainoo has been at United since joining the academy at nine years old, rising through the ranks before breaking into the first team during the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag. But since Amorim took charge last November, the midfielder has struggled to secure a regular starting role.",

Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games.",
      "\"Fair enough, as a manger sometimes you just don’t fancy a player. But look at what he’s already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "\"I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don’t know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.\"",
      "Casemiro, despite previous criticism, has largely impressed this season and appears to be someone Amorim trusts. But at 33, and with his contract expiring next summer, the Brazilian is not seen as a long-term solution.",
      "Butt is also infuriated with Mainoo's treatment and has hinted at where the midfielder could move to. He said: \"The Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game\"",
      "\"The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn’t get on the pitch. He’ll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.",
      "\"If Mainoo was playing for another Premier League club, United go and buy him for £70m or £80m. Now we’re going to sell him and he’ll be a superstar elsewhere like McTominay, Elanga, Henderson – we can mention loads of them.",
      "\"We’re getting rid of players who love the football club, it’s mind-boggling. I get the Garnacho one because his attitude and behaviour was terrible but you don’t hear that about Kobbie.",
      "\"He’s a top, top, top player that we are f****** up. Kobbie has got to go. If I’m looking after him I’m telling him “we’re getting you out of that football club”.",
      "\"For his football career he has to leave United, he’s lost 18 months of development. I hope he goes abroad because it’s embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea, which could happen.",
      "\"They might go and get him because they are putting together a very good, young squad and keep buying young players. He could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.",
      "\"I’ve known Kobbie since he was eight but you wouldn’t be doing him justice if you told him to stay and not to take that move. That’s such a sad thing for me to say.\"",
      "Scholes agreed, saying: \"Do you know what? You’d have to advise him to go [to Chelsea], wouldn’t you? If he rang me and said 'look, Chelsea are interested, what do you think?' I’d say go all day long.\"",

      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "It was a non-negotiable for United to leave Molineux with three points, and it was comfortable in the end, despite the visitors' best efforts to give the worst team in the Premier League a chance of getting a result.",
      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the top flight. Amorim was furious when he spoke after that match, and he still looked agitated on the touchline against Wolves.",
      "\"He'll turn the Reds around,\" was sung just once at Old Trafford last week. The chant was missing from the catalogue in Wolverhampton and '12 Days of Cantona' was aired instead.",
      "United were one of three clubs in the Premier League to have no goals from substitutes so far this season, which must be put down to Amorim's tendency to make conservative changes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was named on the bench again. Mainoo scored a special 97th-minute match-winner against Wolves at Molineux in February 2024, when he was still considered an integral part of the team. On this occasion, there was a huge cheer for the youngster when he was introduced near the end.",
      "Cunha returned to Molineux for the first time since joining United and he mistakenly headed for the home team dressing room when he exited the team coach. Cunha milled about, speaking to Wolves staff and former teammates, and looked comfortable at the venue where his career took off.",
      "Ayden Heaven retained his starting role, despite a hellish 45 minutes against West Ham. The defender was hooked at the interval and was bound to be tested again by a physical Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "There were hundreds of seats vacant in the Sir Jack Hayward Stand and Stan Cullis Stand. Wolves fans protested against their owners by delaying their entry into the ground, but there were still plenty of gold seats when the demonstration was over and the disenchanted trickled in.",
      "Heaven apologised for a mix-up in communication with Senne Lammens. \"We want Fosun out, we want Fosun out,\" the Wolves protestors chanted. The United fans responded with a vitriolic chant about Joel Glazer.",
      "There was mutiny in the air and Wolves fans could not believe what they had seen when Fernandes fired United into the lead. Cunha under-hit his pass to the skipper and the chance seemed to have gone, but the United captain squirmed the ball in at the front post. It was like a sketch from Benny Hill.",
      "Some fans speculated in the build-up to the game that Wolves had the potential to be Amorim's equivalent of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's visit to Vicarage Road in 2021. Solskjaer was finally put out of his misery after losing against Watford, and a defeat to Wolves would have been a similar nadir for Amorim.",
      "The home side had gone five successive league games without a goal, so United couldn't have had a better opportunity to record just their second clean sheet of the campaign. And they should have put the game to bed once they had taken the lead.",
      "This United side never does anything easily, though. The home side were level on the stroke of half-time thanks to a goal from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo enjoyed a brilliant October, but they regressed at the end of November and both were at the scene of the crime.",
      "The in-game management after taking the lead was dismal. United had experienced international players on the pitch and couldn't control the contest. There is little wonder that the conversation about Amorim's system has resurfaced, but United were able to carve through Wolves like a hot knife through butter when play resumed for the second half, in part because Wolves are shockingly bad.",
      "Not even United could mess up a visit to the league's worst team. Mbeumo slotted into an empty net after a square pass from Diogo Dalot, and Mason Mount scored to gain a two-goal cushion.",
      "Wolves' defending for both goals left plenty to be desired. United got the job done, but there should be concerns that Wolves threatened to make it a contest. The target is to return to the Champions League this season, and a Champions League team would have won with a cricket score.",
      "Fernandes converted a penalty to seal a captain's performance. The Portugal international has not been at his best in recent weeks, but it will be a huge boost if he peaks in the middle of the campaign.",
      "Amorim is hoping to emerge from the winter period without being bowled out and greater tests await in the coming weeks. Thankfully for United, they play Wolves again in just 21 days.",

      "Manchester United have rich history in the FA Youth Cup, the most prestigious competition in academy football. United have won the Youth Cup more than any other club and could extend that record this season.",
      "Darren Fletcher, manager of the Under-18s, has the talent at his disposal to lift the trophy, with the likes of JJ Gabriel, Kai Rooney, Louie Bradbury and Yuel Helafu all ready to contribute.",
      "And the competition rules state Fletcher will be able to call upon academy players who were under the age of 18 at midnight before the end of August, which gives United added strength.",
      "Bendito Mantato, Godwill Kukonki, Dan Armer, Amir Ibragimov and Jim Thwaites are just some of the players who represent the Under-21s but who are eligible to play in the Youth Cup.",
      "That's without mentioning Chido Obi, who could play in the competition again. Obi is currently recovering from a small injury, but he could feature in the Youth Cup for United for a second season in a row.",
      "Obi's goals fired the U18s to the semi-finals of the Youth Cup last season, in which they lost on penalties against eventual winners Aston Villa. Fletcher will be hoping his side can go two steps further this season.",
      "The U18s will begin their Youth Cup campaign against Peterborough at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. There should be a reasonable crowd, but it's a shame to see tickets priced at £10 for adults and £5 for children.",
      "Some may argue that Gabriel is worth paying the turnstile fee for. The 15-year-old is regarded as one of the most exciting talents to have ever come through the academy, and United did all they could to keep him in the summer, with Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada involved in a meeting at Carrington.",
      "The 15-year-old has trained with the first team already. It's unusual for a player so young to be given that opportunity, but United believe he could eventually become the face of the club.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Kai Rooney has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right [wing]. Left-footed, coming in off the right.\"",
      "Michael Carrick's son, Jacey Carrick, also plays in United's academy, and he was handed his debut for the U18s last weekend, coming on from the bench with 20 minutes remaining against Newcastle. He is a left-footed midfielder and has been involved with England's Under-15s.",
      "There are story lines galore with the U18s this season and they are playing entertaining football, impressively beating Liverpool 7-0 at the end of November (Gabriel scored a hat-trick).",
      "Ticket prices should be lower for Tuesday's Youth Cup game, but the youngsters deserve support.",

      "Manchester United moved up to sixth in the Premier League with an ultimately comfortable victory at beleaguered Wolves.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went ahead in the first half when Bruno Fernandes squeezed home a shot after some dismal Wolves defending. United had dominated the opening quarter but after taking the lead they ceded the initiative to the home side and they responded by levelling in first half added time when Jean Bellegarde turned home from inside the box.",
      "United upped the ante after the break and restored the lead early in the second half when Bryan Mbeumo tapped into an empty net after a rush of blood from home keeper Sam Johnstone.",
      "Mason Mount made it three with a classy finish from a lovely Fernandes pass before the skipper rounded off the scoring from the spot after VAR intervened to award United a penalty for handball.",
      "Catch up with how the game unfolded plus the analysis and reaction here.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Mason Mount following Manchester United's victory against Wolves. United were heavy favourites to win against the Premier League's bottom side, who had claimed just two points all season, and they opened the scoring in the 25th minute through Bruno Fernandes after some comical defending.",
      "However, Wolves were level at the interval thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. The home side had not scored for five games, but they broke their duck after a strike from Bellegarde. Wolves were unable to build on that in the second half. United were gifted space in the final third and took advantage, scoring three more goals through Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and a Fernandes penalty.",
      "Amorim was asked whether Mount was now delivering consistently strong performances and here's what he had to say.",
      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",

      "Read more here",
      "United are up to sixth with what turned out to be a comfortable win at Wolves.",
      "Here's the player ratings from Molineux with two 8/10s and Bruno Fernandes excellent",
      "There were boos at the full-time whistle, but most Wolves fans had already left Molineux to get home early, and you can't blame them. Wolves are the worst team in the Premier League by some stretch and not even this United side could slip up tonight. Fernandes and Mount were excellent. There will be stiffer tests ahead for United in the coming weeks, but the good news is they play Wolves again at Old Trafford before New Year.",
      "There's the whistle. Ultimately a comfortable evening for United and Ruben Amorim's men are up to sixth and level on points with Chelsea in fifth.",
      "Stay with us for the analysis and reaction and our player ratings will be along shortly",
      "Nine added minutes! Wolves fans and players do not like that!",
      "United can probably find a fifth or maybe a sixth if they really want it.",
      "The Reds are happy playing keep ball at the moment",
      "United take off Mount and Dalot with Zirkzee and Dorgu coming on.",
      "Very good penalty from the skipper as he buries it into the bottom corner",
      "United are worth this lead, they have dominated the second half and aside from a 15 minute spell at the end of the first half, they have outclassed a Wolves side who are going to start this season with no win from 15 league games and surely relegation beckons",
      "Bruno Fernandes scores from the spot.",
      "VAR intervene to send the referee to the monitor for a handball check. It's a spot kick, and it is very similar to one in the first half that was checked and cleared.",
      "Either way the Reds have a spot kick",
      "Here comes Kobbie. He's getting about 12 minutes plus added time.",
      "This is his 10th appearance off the bench for United in the league but his minutes have been sparse.",
      "He's got a chance to impress with the game all but won.",
      "Wolves have made a triple change to try and get back into this but they don't really have the quality to do so.",
      "If United defend properly there is a comfortable win to be had and potentially more goals as well.",
      "Yoro and Martinez replace Mazrouri and Heaven as Amorim, as he often does, changes his backline.",
      "Martinez return to the team being carefully managed after such a lengthy absence",
      "That third goal has knocked a bit of stuffing out of Wolves and United look like scoring with every attack - and there are plenty of them at the moment.",
      "Cunha has had three or four chances on his return to Molineux but hasn't found his radar.",
      "United about to make a double change at the back with Yoro and Martinez ready to come on",
      "Fernandes was denied with an effort but he clips in a lovely pass to Mount who made a fine run into space and finished with aplomb. Lovely volleyed goal from Mount and a super pass from the skipper.",
      "Bit of breathing space for the visitors now. 3-1 should really be enough for three points",
      "Lovely goal, lovely, lovely goal",
      "Wolves cause a bit of panic with a long throw which United just about scramble away.",
      "The home side then put the ball in the mixer again and again United look hesitant and uncertain at the back.",
      "United do not look secure defensively. In fact neither of these teams is doing much for the art of defending",
      "I have no idea where Johnstone was going there.",
      "Dalot was sent through and the keeper opted to come for the ball but was never going to get there allowing the United wing back to square for Mbeumo to tap into an empty net.",
      "United rewarded for a bright start to the second half but dear oh dear that was very poor play from the home side",
      "United are back in front as Mbuemo taps home with Dalot squaring for the frontman with Johnstone miles out of his net",
      "United make the first running of the second period and Cunha does well to fashion himself a yard of space just outside the box but his effort is over the top",
      "Johnstone is then out quickly to smother the ball at Cunha and the ball breaks to Mbeumo with the keeper stranded but Wolves had three or bodies back between player and goal and manage to scramble it away",
      "We are back under way at Molineux",
      "United need to switch back on after conceding right on the stroke of half time",
      "There's the half time whistle. And here are the half time ratings.",

      "First goal under Rob Edwards for Wolves",
      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the league. They cannot drop further points tonight. They need a second goal to kill off the game and that will be discussed during half-time.",
      "Home side having their best spell of the game and sending a warning to United that they cannot rest on their laurels.",
      "Lammens hasn't really been forced into a save but there is still a bit of nervousness in that United backline.",
      "Whether Wolves have the quality to exploit it remains to be seen and at the other end, United are a threat every time they attack",
      "Wolves have finally realised they are playing a football match and start to get stuck into a few tackles which in turn rallies the crowd a bit.",
      "But United are carrying the greater threat. Dalot delivers a wonderful ball in which is turned behind for a corner.",
      "Then Amad gets a shot away which is deflected behind",
      "Mbeumo races clear in between two defenders and his poked effort is kept out by Johnstone.",
      "Ball falls to Cunha and his effort is hacked off the line and Amad turns the rebound wide.",
      "United can put this game to bed before the break if they go for the juggular here",
      "That was a comical goal. The chance looked to have been wasted, but Fernandes found a way to squirm the ball in at the front post.",
      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" the home fans chant, which is followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "The Wolves fans are raging and rightly so. That was the kind of goal you expect a child’s grassroots football team to concede.",
      "Amorim was unhappy minutes before, screaming at the attack to press with more energy, but he should have a smile on his face now United have taken the lead.",
      "Well how do you explain that. Wolves hold onto the ball for an age, get the pocket picked and then Fernandes, in the box, falls over and still somehow gets up and scuffs a shot goalwards which somehow gets past Johnstone at his near post and dribbles in.",
      "Bruno Fernandes opens the scoring. Possibly the scrapiest goal you will ever see but United won't care. They lead"

Evans took up the position in June following his retirement as a player, but he has left after six months. He was responsible for arranging loans for youngsters and worked closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'.",
      "When Evans was appointed, he said in a statement: “I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential.\" However, the 37-year-old has decided to leave to spend more time with his family, and it's understood he will now take time away from the game before deciding what to do next.",
      "United sources have said the departure is amicable and Evans leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club. Evans' transition into the role had confirmed the end of his playing career. The defender enjoyed two stints at United after coming through the club's academy and made 241 appearances for the Reds.",
      "The Northern Irishman won the Champions League, three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups with United, while he made a total of 536 career appearances. Evans earned 107 caps for Northern Ireland and was awarded an MBE in 2023 for his services to football.",

      "\"He is good on the ball and calm. A player with that much quality and assurance on the ball, I don't see any way how he doesn't get back to a really high level.\"",
      "Meanwhile, after Mainoo was snubbed against West Ham, a furious Paul Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at Amorim. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim, who said last week he views Mainoo as a starter. \"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Mainoo was named on a nine-man United bench to face Wolves, with the midfielder alongside fellow academy graduate Shea Lacey. Altay Bayindir, Patrick Dorgu, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee made up the Reds substitutes.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "AS Roma are reportedly keen to send Evan Ferguson back to Brighton and sign Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee as his replacement.",
      "It’s not going well in Rome for the young Irishman, who has only registered one goal and one assist since joining on loan from Brighton.",
      "Reports suggest Roma are hoping to end Ferguson’s loan spell prematurely, though there is no clause allowing them to do so unilaterally. However, they can negotiate a termination, and if they do, Roma will likely push to sign Zirkzee from Man United.",
      "Two reports from our friends at TEAMtalk claim Ferguson has been offered to multiple clubs ahead of the winter transfer window, while Roma are in ‘pole position’ to land Zirkzee.",
      "The first report says Everton, Leicester City and Celtic are among the clubs in contention for Ferguson’s signature, which is a far cry from the teams linked with a £100million move only two years ago.",
      "Everton have ‘made checks’ despite spending £27m on Thierno Barry last summer.",
      "Adding ‘another layer of intrigue’, Roma and Everton are under the same ownership, which could smooth out negotiations in January.",
      "Roma would be even more eager to send Ferguson back to Brighton if they can agree a deal with Man United for Zirkzee.",
      "TEAMtalk also reports ongoing negotiations between Ruben Amorim’s side and the Italian giants, with United ‘open to offers’ of €35-40m (£30.6-35m) or a loan with a mandatory purchase clause.",
      "The Giallorossi face competition from four Premier League clubs, Aston Villa, West Ham, Brighton and Everton, while Serie A rivals Juventus, Inter and AC Milan are also credited with interest.",
      "Competition is fierce and includes some top clubs, despite Zirkzee largely underwhelming since joining United from Bologna in the 2024 summer transfer window.",
      "The Dutch international cost the Red Devils around £35m and has scored just eight goals and provided three assists in 58 matches.",
      "He has only started three games this season, all in United’s last four Premier League matches, but has made a positive impact during that run.",
      "Zirkzee knows he must be playing regularly to stand a chance of making Ronald Koeman’s squad for next summer’s World Cup. And when Benjamin Sesko returns from injury, there’s a chance Amorim starts overlooking him again.",
      "Sesko hasn’t done enough to convince Zirkzee that he won’t play once the Slovenian is back fit, but managers can show bias towards players they sign, which applies to Sesko, not Zirkzee.",
      "As for Ferguson, it’s not clear what the future holds or whether he’ll ever come close to realising the potential he once seemed destined for.",
      "Not long ago, there was talk of him commanding a £100m fee and Brighton cashing in yet again on a player they bought for peanuts.",
      "But not anymore. There’s a strong chance he ends up at Leicester, who sit 13th in the Championship. And if he flops there, it’s hard to see a future for him in the Premier League, let alone at one of Europe’s elite clubs.",
      "It’s an unfortunate position for Brighton to be in. They never expected Ferguson’s Roma loan to go so poorly, and now they may be forced into a last-chance-saloon loan. They could become the victims of a striker domino.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano is “not aware of any contact” between Man Utd and Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos ahead of the January transfer market.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim over the summer with over £200m in new signings, including big deals for Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "However, there are rumours that Man Utd are prepared to spend again in the winter market with a rumour that Real Madrid legend Ramos could provide some much-needed experience in defence.",
      "But Romano has ruled out that potential signing for the time being with the Italian not hearing of any contact between the two parties.",
      "READ: Semenyo to replace Salah at Liverpool as 10 likeliest January transfers ranked",
      "Romano told GiveMeSport: “I’m not aware of any contact between Sergio Ramos and Man United now.”",
      "A new midfielder is top of the Red Devils’ list in the January transfer window but Man Utd’s promising financial are unlikely to have any impact on their winter budget.",
      "Man Utd revealed that they registered an operating profit of £13m compared to an operating loss of £7m a year ago when releasing their results for the first quarter of the new financial year.",
      "“Whilst Berrada has hailed the robust’ financial figures, and pointed out in this financial statement that Man Utd are ‘committed to, and complying with, the Premier League’s PSR rules’ – the truth is, Man Utd don’t have huge money to spend, and it is much more likely they will save their big transfer investment until the summer, rather than pay what would likely be inflated fees to try to land some of their targets in January.",
      "“Signing a world-class defensive midfielder remains the priority, but again, that is much more likely in the summer rather than January, with interest in Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba.”",
      "A potential deal for Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson could have to wait until the summer, if Man Utd go down that path, and former defender Paul Parker isn’t sure he’d be a good investment for £100m.",
      "Parker told Goal: “I keep seeing his name bandied about. When it’s Manchester United, everybody wants to throw out someone all the time. Everyone goes with it.",
      "“I’m not used to labelling players with numbers. You just want a midfield player who has got the capability to go up and down, wants to go up and down, and he definitely has that. I’m quite sure a lot of these young players don’t want to be labelled anymore. They did all that when they were kids playing FIFA. When it gets to the real world, you see that they want to get about. In my opinion you want midfield players like a Roy Keane, a Paul Ince, a Bryan Robson – players who can and want to do everything.",
      "“I see where he is [Anderson] and I quite like him. The moment you mention it with Manchester United it’s £100m. That seems to be the going rate. Are United going to go and spend that kind of money on one player? I think it would be foolhardy if they go and do that.",
      "“When you look at Anderson, he is a high-energy player but there are a lot of high-energy players out there. To be in the Premier League now, it is about how athletic your team is. There is a lot better chance of getting results at weekends, gives you an advantage and opportunity, when you have got athletic players. Sunderland are proving that at the moment. One player for me in midfield is not enough. They need a major rebuild.”",

      "",
      "He’s done some good things – a stunner against Wolves in the League Cup, a nice assist in defeat at Leeds – but still feels nailed on to be the next young forward to drown in stagnant pool of attacking talent that Stamford Bridge has become in the BlueCo era.",

      "",
      "He enjoyed something of a hot streak in November, though what we’ve seen of Garnacho more recently suggests his goal against Qarabag and brace of assists against Wolves was more about the standard of opposition than any real indication of him blossoming at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The jury’s out and frankly we don’t expect them back in session for the rest of what looks to be a predictably frustrating season of infrequent highs from a base of lows.",
      "Wirtz has dropped down the growing list of Liverpool problems Arne Slot has to deal with, not least because he appears to be relatively low maintenance in comparison to others (or An Other).",
      "It’s not clear whether a slight uptick in his performances is down to Wirtz’s slow adaptation to the Premier League or if a guy with that much talent is bound to show glimpses of quality if afforded enough time on the pitch. We suspect the latter.",
      "But him not making the starting line-up for the huge clash with Inter on Wednesday isn’t a great sign of Arne Slot’s trust in a playmaker who needs to do a helluva lot more to ease doubts over his suitability to be the face of the New Liverpool in a post-Mohamed Salah era.",
      "Who needs Kevin De Bruyne? Oh, we do. One excellent performance against Wolves has been followed by not a lot besides from Reijnders, who’s shown glimpses of his quality, but nothing like what we expected after that opening-day clinic.",
      "He’s proven that he at the very least has the character required to avoid cowing under the pressure at Old Trafford as so many big-money signing have done before, but if we’re to tar all Manchester United forwards with the brush Roy Keane has used to claim Mason Mount is undeserving of a place in Ruben Amorim’s team then Cunha really needs to improve on his output after one (wonderful) goal and one assist in 13 appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "",
      "Thomas Frank cruelly compared the Netherlands international to Florian Wirtz in October when asked about his struggle to adapt to life in the Premier League, and Simons did indeed look similarly short of whatever that thing is required to succeed in the English top flight, with the football happening around rather than through him.",
      "But a goal and an assist in the victory over Brentford and then a goal on Tuesday to help Tottenham see off Slavia Prague suggests that his teammates and – crucially – Frank now recognise his role and importance to Spurs being more than a second-balls outfit.",
      "Genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack after two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games has since faded into questions as to whether Pedro would even be in a Blues XI looking to challenge for major honours in future.",
      "While Liam Delap has so far failed to prove he’s the answer as the furthest man forward, he looks more suited to that role than Pedro, who thrives in a more withdrawn role which is sure to be occupied by Cole Palmer assuming Pedro Neto continues on the right flank.",

      "Started superbly with five goals and an assist in his first seven games to raise questions as to why Liverpool spent £125m on another striker, then endured a barren spell with no goals or assists in 12 games – largely off the bench – while Slot tried and failed to bed in his £125m striker, before he scored two goals against Leeds to again raise questions as to why they signed an alternative £125m striker.",
      "Liverpool shouldn’t have signed the £125m striker.",
      "",
      "His first Arsenal goal being the winner against his former club and his next three all coming against the Gunners’ bitter north London rivals whom he was days even hours away from joining instead of them all adds to what was an already pretty clear sense that Eze’s return to his boyhood club was meant to be.",
      "But those were his only four goals and the return of captain Martin Odegaard has put a bit of a dampener on things with Eze again forced out to the left flank where he still looks horribly uncertain of himself and ineffective in comparison to Gabriel Martinelli or Leandro Trossard.",

      "Spurs legend Chris Waddle has explained why he thinks his former club should snub Marcus Rashford, but he would actually be a no-brainer signing…",
      "Few could have foreseen Rashford‘s summer move to Barcelona going as well as it has, with the Manchester United outcast being one of the window’s best signings across Europe.",
      "The 28-year-old has featured far more consistently for Barcelona than most imagined he would, with his tally of six goals and eleven assists in 21 appearances a stunning return in his first six months.",

      "Given how well Rashford has performed for Barcelona and Aston Villa over the past year, Spurs, especially for the fee involved, should snap Man Utd’s hands off if gifted the opportunity to land the England international.",
      "Spurs legend Waddle is against this potential signing, though his reasoning is somewhat flawed.",
      "“Spurs have failed to replace Harry Kane. They now seem to be too interested in only signing young players like Archie Gray, Lucas Bergvall and Wilson Odobert and trying to develop them. It’s about time they started signing ready-made players,” Waddle said in an interview with WhichBookie.",

      "So, Rashford is “better than what they have got”, but Spurs do not “need another left winger”… Eh?",
      "Spurs are not short of options in wide areas, but their current options are at a certain level and certainly worth being replaced with an upgrade if a player of Rashford’s ability becomes available.",
      "Rashford’s versatility is another positive. He should not be deemed a replacement for Kane, but he would be a great option for the No.9 role and increase Tottenham’s output from up front/out wide.",
      "He also fits the bill as a “ready-made player”, even though Waddle thinks otherwise…",
      "“He’s not shown enough in the Premier League for Manchester United. He had one good season a few years ago, but apart from that he’s been quite inconsistent. I personally wouldn’t be trying to sign him,” Rashford added.",
      "“Spurs should be looking at somebody who is proven in this league. They shouldn’t be put off trying to sign players from other Premier League clubs who have performed well.",
      "“I know they’ll be doing their scouting far and wide across Europe and elsewhere, but sometimes I think they just need to buy somebody who is ready-made for the league and is already performing week in, week out.”",
      "There is no doubt that he had plenty of dips in his career, but he showed what he is capable of in his 30-goal campaign for Man Utd and during last season’s loan at Aston Villa.",

      "Amorim made it clear publicly that Mainoo would be fighting it out with captain Bruno Fernandes for a position in the Man Utd starting XI this season.",
      "That led to Mainoo attempting to engineer a loan move before the summer deadline before Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox convinced the youngster to stay.",
      "However, Mainoo hasn’t started a Premier League game this season and there are rumours he now wants to leave Man Utd in search for regular game time before the 2026 World Cup in the summer.",
      "Richard Keys claimed earlier this week that he knows the real reason why Amorim isn’t playing Mainoo, he said in his blog: “I learned at the weekend why Amorim won’t play Mainoo, who sadly will leave United now – probably in January.",
      "“Amorim believes he can’t get round the pitch – that Mainoo isn’t mobile enough. I’ve heard some baffling nonsense from this generation of coaches (I give you Wilfried Nancy after Celtic’s defeat to Hearts) and this is right up there. Not mobile enough? So Amorim picks Casemiro instead? If it wasn’t so sad it would be laughable.”",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes insists that German giants Bayern Munich ‘see an opportunity’ to sign Mainoo in the January transfer window.",
      "His £80m market value is said to be ‘manageable for a club that has historically focused on developing young players with room to grow’ as they continue to ‘closely monitor’ the England international.",

      "The report adds: ‘For Kobbie Mainoo, choosing his next destination is crucial. He wants a project where he can grow, compete, and take on responsibilities, and that’s where Bayern Munich has the advantage. The German club is seriously considering turning its interest into a formal offer, convinced that the Englishman could become a key midfielder in the coming years.’",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage reaching the Christmas break, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the play-off round at worst – and with Chelsea the lowest of the six at 13th with two games to go any number of them could still wind up in the top eight – while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",

      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and could lose reigning Serie A champions Napoli from the Champions League before the knockouts. Roma and Bologna have pulled up few trees in the Europa and look set for the play-offs, and even the continent’s first true Conference League specialists Fiorentina have been a mixed bag there.",

      "Manchester United could become the perfect destination for young talents at major clubs who are struggling to break into the first team.",
      "Players like Ethan Nwaneri and Endrick simply aren’t playing enough, and for all of United’s issues in recent years, they would still represent an ambitious and exciting move for any prospect.",
      "A recent report – believe it or not – claims Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Arsenal wonderkid Nwaneri and wants to take advantage of the Gunners’ need to sell a valuable player after spending over £850million across the last five summer transfer windows.",
      "Nwaneri is one of five young players at big clubs who could be vulnerable to a Manchester United approach – including another Hale End graduate and a Real Madrid starlet.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s top transfer priority is signing a new central midfielder, but if a player with Nwaneri’s potential becomes available and is open to a transfer, you absolutely have to be all over it.",
      "Right now, Nwaneri’s pathway into the Arsenal starting XI is blocked by some outstanding players. He signed a new contract earlier this year and will have been briefed on the club’s transfer plans, but there’s no doubt he would have been promised more than one start across 21 Champions League and Premier League games.",
      "The 18-year-old has certainly taken his Carabao Cup chances, playing every minute as Arsenal knocked out Port Vale and Brighton, scoring against the latter in a 2-0 win.",
      "But he has played only 20 minutes across Arsenal’s last eight league matches and has been an unused substitute eight times. Yes, he’s young, and yes, he has still logged significant minutes for someone his age in a team as strong as Mikel Arteta’s, but there comes a point where you wonder whether your long-term future lies in a squad containing Ebere Eze and Martin Odegaard. He’s not starting ahead of either of them if they’re fit.",
      "Nwaneri has played most of his minutes on the right wing, but it appears one of the promises made to him was the chance to feature more centrally, with Noni Madueke’s arrival all but confirming that.",
      "Nwaneri would fit very nicely as one of Ruben Amorim’s wide 10s, which is a hybrid between a right winger and an attacking midfielder: the two roles that best suit him. It’s almost a position made for him. We’re not sure he has the work rate or defensive instincts to play as a wing-back, and that Arjen Robben-style cut-in onto his left foot is irresistible.",
      "United would need to cough up a significant fee to sign one of Hale End’s most exciting recent graduates, and if he does leave Arsenal, they’ve got his younger brother ready to break through, because of course they do.",
      "",
      "From one Hale End prodigy to another, could Lewis-Skelly boost his England chances by switching to Manchester United?",
      "Naturally a central midfielder, the 18-year-old has played all his senior football at left-back, and he’s actually very good there. Good enough to break quickly into the England team and keep an injury-prone Riccardo Calafiori out of the XI for most of last season in both the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "Those minutes and performances in 2024/25 are leaving people baffled by his reduced playing time this term, but they should actually be the reason everyone calms down. He’s only 19 and has already played the workload of a 21-year-old. It’s hardly a disaster that he hasn’t started as much now Calafiori is fit and flying, though the Italian’s poor outing at Aston Villa could open the door again.",
      "Lewis-Skelly loves being at Arsenal, and a lack of minutes this season won’t change that. What could change that is genuine interest from Manchester United.",
      "He could use his left-back experience to become a very useful midfield option in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. He has the engine, the technical ability, and the defensive grounding, albeit from a different role and against different types of players. Left-wing-back is also viable, and there’s no doubt he would be an upgrade on Patrick Dorgu, even if the Dane is an Amorim signing and only 21 himself.",
      "It’s a long shot, but what a signing he would be for United.",
      "",
      "We move away from Arsenal but stay in London as we assess George’s chances of leaving Stamford Bridge for Old Trafford.",
      "An out-and-out winger who can also play as a centre-forward, that versatility makes the 19-year-old an intriguing option in one of Amorim’s wide 10 roles.",
      "Most of George’s minutes last season came in the Europa Conference League, and that pattern has continued, making four appearances in Chelsea’s six Champions League matches, including starts against Benfica and Qarabag. But as the competition progresses and Chelsea raise the stakes, it’s unlikely he’ll continue playing significant European minutes. He didn’t get off the bench in Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat at Atalanta – Chelsea’s biggest Champions League game of the season.",
      "He hasn’t made any of Enzo Maresca’s last six Premier League matchday squads and was almost sold to Fulham in the summer. A departure in 2026 feels inevitable.",
      "George is less of a sure thing than Lewis-Skelly or Nwaneri, but the talent and ceiling are obvious. His ability to play across the frontline makes him valuable, and he could operate effectively on either flank under Amorim.",
      "A January move makes less sense given United have no European football to help integrate him, but they should be back in continental action in 2026/27.",
      "There’s no doubt Old Trafford would be a far better environment for his development than Chelsea, who literally tried to sell him a few months ago.",
      "",
      "When Levi Colwill returns from injury, there’s a chance Acheampong becomes a forgotten man at Stamford Bridge. Again. There were discussions about selling him last summer, but Colwill’s ACL injury changed everything.",
      "As a defender capable of playing right, left, and centre-back, Acheampong is someone who could thrive in a back three. He has wing-back potential but could easily become an elite wide centre-back in a system like Amorim’s… if it only looked slightly more functional.",
      "The 19-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and would likely cost a significant fee, but there’s a good chance he’d be worth every penny. Considering his potential, Chelsea would likely want at least £30million. But with the size of their squad, they may feel inclined to accept a semi-reasonable offer.",
      "United already have a few good young centre-backs in Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson, though the latter feels more like an emergency option. Acheampong would come in as the second-best of the group behind Yoro, or debatably first, ahead of the Frenchman.",
      "Fredricson is a promising 20-year-old who played in the latter stages of last season, which only underlines the need for more defensive depth.",
      "Harry Maguire is out of contract at the end of the season, though reports suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim want to keep him longer, so there’s a strong chance United invest in a new central defender next summer. Why shouldn’t it be Acheampong?",
      "",
      "And why shouldn’t Manchester United throw their hat into the ring for Brazil and Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick?",
      "It’s a transfer that makes a lot of sense. Endrick’s idol is Sir Bobby Charlton. He is struggling to break into the first team at the world’s biggest club, and there is clear interest from one of the world’s top three most iconic clubs.",
      "Amorim has some stellar attacking options now; Mason Mount is impressing, Benjamin Sesko will return from injury, and Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are settling in well, but the Portuguese head coach could still do with more attacking depth, even if signing a central midfielder is the top priority.",
      "There is reportedly interest from Lyon, with Madrid understandably preferring a loan for the 19-year-old. But United could throw a cat among the pigeons by making a cheeky enquiry.",
      "Endrick wants to become Brazil’s main man, and that’s impossible when he has played just 11 minutes for Real Madrid this season. He has been an unused substitute 15 times!",
      "A loan move in January seems the most likely outcome, but of all the players mentioned here, Endrick will have the shortest patience and is surely the most fed up…by a country mile.",

      "Much like Aston Villa probably didn’t consider the prospect of making sure to not even accidentally use Harvey Elliott in five more of their possible 41 games in all competitions for fear of Liverpool coming calling for a £35m bill, Unai Emery likely didn’t intend to lie to the player’s face on what was presumably their first meeting.",
      "“All the best,” said the Spaniard in a video posted to the club’s social channels after the summer transfer window closed. “All the best for you, because then all the best is for us as well.”",
      "Their “all the best” has been the worst-case scenario for a 22-year-old who has not featured since October 2 or even made a Premier League matchday squad since October 19.",
      "If anyone would be forgiven for ranting to the media about their perceived poor treatment, it’s the player who left Liverpool in search of more game time and has somehow contrived to find even less. Elliott has been thrown under the open-top bus parade Villa are presumably planning for their upcoming Treble.",
      "But he would ultimately have no leg to stand on with his complaints. While it is curious that Villa committed to such a deal for a player they have almost immediately discarded, any questioning of Emery’s decisions or methods can be counteracted by the results, the performances and the ongoing transformation of a mess he inherited three years ago.",
      "The manager’s fundamental argument, before contemplating the tactical intricacies and other specifics, is that “there are other players performing very well”.",
      "Emiliano Buendia has, in a nutshell, completely f**ked everyone over this season. There is even a Ross Barkley-shaped spanner in the works that few might have foreseen.",
      "But also ahead of Elliott in the pecking order for the positions behind Ollie Watkins is another Big Six loan cast-off who is quietly proving his worth.",
      "Jadon Sancho still has not started a Premier League game for Villa. He was a substituted substitute in his longest top-flight appearance for them so far, and sits uncomfortably between Marco Bizot and Victor Lindelof in terms of minutes played for the club in all competitions this season.",
      "Just a fortnight ago it was written on the BBC that borrowing Sancho and Elliott was ‘looking like expensive mistakes for everyone’. But their situations are not even close to comparable. The former has maximised his scant opportunities in a way the latter has been unable to do.",
      "There was inevitable social media mockery over the original 007 reprising his role with another cameo in which he neither scored nor assisted against Arsenal. But his impact was clear: in the quickly-taken throw-in which maintained Villa pressure before the goal; in his nimble footwork and pass in the build up; in his back-post header which prompted a scramble and ultimately forced the winner.",
      "In the 133 minutes Sancho has spent on a Premier League pitch this season – against Arsenal, Manchester City, Sunderland, Liverpool and Bournemouth, as well as Leeds and Wolves, Aston Villa have scored four times and not conceded once.",
      "Only Ethan Nwaneri – with eight goals for and zero against during his on-field time for Arsenal this season – has a better such record.",
      "It is humble progress for one of the worst Manchester United signings who actual Chelsea spent £5m specifically not to make their problem, but Emery is using Sancho to form some of his Villa solutions.",
      "The same cannot currently be said of Elliott, whose reserve-rotting remains a strange sub-plot in this remarkable campaign.",
      "Villa took a burden off Manchester United with no strings attached beyond this season, and might have already seen enough to make him their own in the summer. They stole a potential jewel from Liverpool with an obligation to buy and are – much like Chelsea did with Sancho – desperately checking the fine print for a way out.",
      "At least Elliott knows now that “all the best” is not actually a binding commitment for a prosperous life together.",

      "United’s hierarchy, keen to streamline the attack around Sesko long-term and raise funds for a supporting forward, remain open to offers around €35-40m (£30.6-£35m, $40.7-$46.5m), or a loan with a mandatory purchase clause.",
      "Roma’s sporting director, Frederic Massara, views Zirkzee as the final piece of an attacking overhaul. Artem Dovbyk has failed to hit expected heights, and Ferguson has struggled, prompting the Giallorossi to potentially pull the trigger early on the Irishman’s loan from Brighton.",
      "Zirkzee, who exploded onto the scene with 11 goals for Bologna in 2023/24, before his £36.5m switch to United, has already signalled his willingness to return to Serie A and reunite with the league that showcased his elegant hold-up play and eye for goal.",

      "Sevilla and PSV Eindhoven complete the chasing pack, though momentum currently lies firmly with Roma.",
      "With Ferguson’s exit all but confirmed and personal terms unlikely to be an obstacle, the next fortnight will decide whether Zirkzee boards a flight to Rome or remains at Carrington.",

The Old Trafford club has been working for weeks on an offer capable of enticing the veteran defender, who is keen on the possibility of joining a historic team that needs to bolster its defence. With a young squad in the midst of a rebuilding process, Sergio Ramos’s arrival would be seen as a move of enormous impact both on and off the pitch.’",
      "Man Utd will ‘offer him a short-term contract with attractive terms, including a competitive salary and a key role in the decisive stretch of the Premier League season’.",

      "Liverpool’s is a summer signing, Arsenal’s is a surprise, and Brighton’s is still reeling after not getting his big move. Here goes…",
      "",
      "Premier League leaders Arsenal can’t look at a single player and say: ‘You must improve.’ Maybe Ebere Eze? When he isn’t soaked in North London Derby narrative, he’s not really been that great.",
      "But he’s not Arsenal’s player. Raya is Arsenal’s player. This is despite him leading the Premier League Golden Glove race. Maybe you lose points for slamming the ground like a child. Who knows how the algorithm works?",
      "",
      "Signed from Nice for £26million in the summer, Guessand has zero goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances for Villa.",
      "",
      "Smith was Bournemouth’s representative throughout most of last season. We said they had to sign a new right-back, but then they had to sign a new centre-back. And then a left-back. And then another centre-back. So then a new right-back became an afterthought.",
      "Andoni Iraola did sign Alex Jimenez, but he’s only 20 years old, so Smith has been called upon frequently this campaign. Sharing the right-back load is probably the way to go.",
      "",
      "With only one goal contribution in 15 games, Yarmoliuk has not done enough offensively but looks like a tidy player.",
      "",
      "His failed transfer to Manchester United has clearly had a detrimental effect on Baleba’s form, and he is playing his way out of his dream move.",
      "There’s no doubt that Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are now favoured by the United hierarchy. It’s time to get your s**t together, son.",
      "",
      "After looking like they’d be competitive all season, Burnley have just gone off the boil a bit. We’re suddenly fearful that the Clarets and Wolves will continue to fade away and the relegation battle will be a lot less exciting than initially expected.",
      "",
      "In exactly six Premier League starts, Delap hasn’t registered a goal or assist for Chelsea. He’s now out for around six weeks and won’t be the Blues’ representative here much longer, because six starts soon won’t be enough to merit an inclusion.",
      "",
      "This feels harsh. But a 6.70 average rating doesn’t feel wrong for Pino. Palace have just been that good this season. The Spaniard has one goal and one assist in 13 appearances.",
      "",
      "It’s hardly surprising that Barry – who didn’t register a shot on target until his 14th Everton appearance and only scored his first goal on matchday 15 – is Everton’s ‘worst’ player in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "King’s average rating might be a bit pants but he’s still shown plenty of promise this season.",
      "",
      "After joining last summer, Perri didn’t get off to the best start, nor the worst. Then he got injured. And because his start to life at Leeds was so meh, Daniel Farke felt no need to rush him back, putting his faith in Karl Darlow. And now Perri is playing again, but conceding a whole heap of ghoals.",
      "",
      "Almost any player would’ve been funny, but Isak might be the funniest option of all. The Mo Salah narrative is already so strong that we are fine with it not being him. Florian Wirtz has been awful, Alisson is conceding goals for fun, and Milos Kerkez is really struggling. But the floppiest flop in Premier League flopsville is a beauty, really.",
      "The most expensive player in Premier League history has one goal and one assist (which was an accident) in eight league appearances for Liverpool. He’s looked off the pace since minute one. All after the biggest saga of the summer transfer window and burning all of his bridges with Newcastle United. It isn’t easy to have any sympathy.",

      "",
      "We’re hardly surprised by Elanga’s inclusion. For £55million, his output has been nowhere near good enough. His end product has lacked all season, and Jacob Murphy might have already usurped him in Eddie Howe’s pecking order.",
      "",
      "Wood hasn’t played since October 18 but was pretty rubbish up to that point. He scored a brace against Brentford on matchday one but those are his only two goals in eight Premier League matches. At this point last season, he had 10 goals and Forest were fifth in the table.",
      "",
      "Sunderland have been the Premier League’s surprise package this season, making the inclusion of any player feel harsh, but it has to be someone. And that someone is young Belgian attacker Talbi.",

      "Not one Wolves player can hold their head up right now. It’s been pathetic all across the board. Though there is an argument that they’ve been massively let down by the ownership, who didn’t have a good summer transfer window. And now Andre and Strand Larsen are tanking their value. Ideal."

      "“For his football career he has to leave Man United. He has lost 18 months of development.",
      "“I hope he goes abroad, it is embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea. They might go and get him, as they are putting together a very good young squad. They keep buying young players and the right good young players.",
      "“You think he could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.”",
      "Scholes responded: “You would have to advise him to go. If he rang me and said ‘I think Chelsea are in for me what do you think’, I’d say ‘all day long’.”",
      "He added: “He is a 20 year old kid, he is going to have to leave. What will happen know is he’ll bring him into a game and he won’t be great, because he needs five, six, seven, eight games. He’ll throw him into the team and say ‘I told you so’.",

      "And now Arena Napoli claim that ‘progress’ has been made with Mainoo from the Serie A side over a potential January deal with the website also bringing an update from Sky Sport journalist Luca Marchetti.",
      "On the current state of negotiations over the Man Utd midfielder, Marchetti said: “Regarding the midfielder, Napoli is considering the timing of Anguissa’s return, before taking action. They’ll try to make changes in midfield, as Manna recently reiterated. As for the various deals, they’ll need to figure out what exits there will be: for roster reasons or purely financial reasons.",
      "‘Napoli needs to figure out how to proceed quickly, because they need reinforcements numerically. If they were to sign someone at the end of the transfer window, then they’d be closer to Anguissa’s return, and the matter would be less urgent. If you want someone on January 2nd, you have to move now. This also applies to the Englishman.”",
      "As well as his comments on Mainoo, Scholes added that he doesn’t think Man Utd boss Amorim “gets” the club, he said: “I don’t think the manager gets this club, full stop. I just don’t think he’s the right man.",

      "“That’s from the club, we talk about how it is a different club. They’ve got Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox, who are probably brilliant at what they do, but they are not Man United, they don’t have a clue what it is like to buy a Man United player and bring a Man United manager in.",
      "“If you go to Sporting Lisbon and watch, they play three at the back, right away that is a no as Man United never do that. You can’t do that, it has been proven over years and years. I am talking even before Sir Alex Ferguson. It was always about 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2 and entertaining people.",
      "“He has not got that in him. That’s why I’m saying Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, they have probably gone out and watched Sporting Lisbon. How can they think that is a Man United manager?",
      "“He brought four defenders on against West Ham. If we go 1-0 up, the manager always said 2, 3, 4. He just doesn’t get it, I don’t think anyone at the club gets Man United.",

      "A perfect Champions League record would land clubs a minimum of £115m this season, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City due more with TV payments.",
      "There is a reason that eight of Europe’s biggest spenders in the 2025 transfer window came from the Premier League, including all six Champions League qualifiers: prize money.",
      "The levels of money on offer in numerous competitions are preposterous and perhaps no more so than in the Champions League, in which clubs can earn well in excess of nine figures.",
      "",
      "As part of the revamped formats for their three main competitions, UEFA have announced a revenue distribution system for how the total prize money of around £2.88billion would be allocated each season up to 2026/27.",
      "Just over £2.1bn (74.38%) will be distributed to clubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, £490.7m (17.02%) to teams participating in the Europa League, and £247.5m (8.6%) split between those in the Europa Conference League.",
      "In the Champions League, the pot is further broken down into:",
      "1) Equal shares (£581.7m/27.5%) – a set ‘starting fee’ of £16.2m for all 36 clubs which qualify for the league phase, who are guaranteed this money regardless of subsequent results in the competition.",
      "2) Performance-related fixed amounts (£793.6m/37.5%) – £1.8m per each league phase win, £608,000 per each league phase draw and £238,000 per each league phase position, going up in increments from the team in 36th receiving £238,000 and the team in 1st receiving £8.57m.",
      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16.",
      "3) The ‘value pillar’ (£740.6m/35%) – a combination of payments based on club coefficient rankings and the TV pool. This can be harder to accurately calculate but will naturally reward the ‘bigger’ clubs and traditional elite.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and the Premier League’s four regular European qualifiers in Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would be the biggest winners here, with Qarabag, Pafos and Kairat due more modest sums.",
      "A rough estimation of all 36 participating clubs’ value pillar payments will be factored into the final prize money total, which for a few clubs should far exceed £100m.",
      "There is also a fixed fee of £3.73m for all clubs eliminated in the qualification play-offs before the commencement of the league phase. That is for the Celtics and Rangers’ of this world.",
      "",
      "The following is an estimated breakdown of how much prize money each team has already earned from participating in the Champions League in 2025/26, before matchday revenue and other factors are taken into account.",

      "Arsenal ‘need to sell a valuable player’ due to financial rules, and Manchester United are ready to capitalise by signing one of their best youngsters, according to reports.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s side spent over £250million last summer and are reportedly walking a financial tightrope, much like Manchester United have been for a while.",
      "They couldn’t have done much worse than last season’s 15th-place finish, and Amorim was backed with over £200million in new signings as his attack was completely transformed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were all bought for big money, but the Red Devils are expected to be active in the winter transfer window, with a new central midfielder at the top of Amorim’s wishlist.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team are already planning for January, with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson among Amorim’s midfield targets.",
      "However, a report from an insider on X with a ‘team of five elite reporters’ says United are ‘circling like sharks’ to sign Arsenal wonderkid Ethan Nwaneri.",
      "It’s claimed that the Gunners ‘need to sell a valuable player to fund future targets due to financial rules’, and Nwaneri could be the one sacrificed.",
      "If the ‘unthinkable’ happens and United sign Nwaneri, they are likely to sell or loan out academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Nwaneri signed a new contract earlier this year but has found minutes very difficult to come by in 2025/26, leaving him ‘fed up’ as he is ‘barely getting a kick’ and his career is ‘stalling hard’.",
      "Amorim is a ‘big admirer’ of the 18-year-old and ‘would love to manage him’, it’s added.",
      "It’s clear that United’s priority should be signing a new midfielder, but Brighton and Forest will want an absolute fortune for Baleba and Anderson, respectively.",
      "Surprisingly, Casemiro has been very good this season, which has lessened the need to spend big on a central midfielder. But we’ve seen in the past that his form can nosedive easily, and an injury to the Brazilian could spark a midfield crisis.",
      "Amorim is reluctant to play Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo together, meaning an injury to Casemiro would force the United head coach to start Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte has massively underperformed since joining United from Paris Saint-Germain, and whenever he comes onto the pitch, they seem to play much worse.",
      "Furthermore, if United receive a sufficient offer for Casemiro from Saudi Arabia, they will definitely consider it. Despite his form, he is 33 years old, one of the club’s highest earners on £300,000 a week, and is out of contract at the end of the season, though there is a club option to extend to 2027.",
      "Nwaneri isn’t an out-and-out central midfielder and would be out of place in that position in a 3-4-2-1, but he’d be outstanding as one of Amorim’s wide 10s behind the striker.",
      "It is important to note that there is very little chance this transfer happens.",
      "READ NEXT: Are Man Utd ‘moving in the right direction’? Or did win ‘highlight’ biggest problem ahead of Amorim?",
      "Man United have been linked with Ethan Nwaneri, and they could be an ideal destination for these out-of-favour wonderkids, including two Arsenal stars.",
      "Arsenal have suffered another injury blow, though this surely ruins any hope of Manchester United pulling off an ‘unthinkable’ January transfer…",
      "Mikel Arteta has confirmed he has no intention of letting two squad players leave Arsenal in January, so their biggest Premier League title fear is clear…",
      "Arsenal are ‘open’ to the bit-part player leaving on loan in January if the right opportunity arises.",
      "England will be aware of the similar situations involving Liverpool forward Rio Ngumoha and Ethan Nwaneri of Arsenal in the ongoing eligibility battle.",
      "Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere insists Ethan Nwaneri has “stepped up his game another level this year” with the Gunners top of the league."

      "Former Manchester United defender Paul Parker has claimed Bruno Fernandes is ‘not a leader’ and suggested he cannot be mentioned in the same breath as some of the club’s great captains.",
      "Fernandes was handed the United armband in the summer of 2023 and there has been constant scrutiny over this style of leadership ever since.",
      "Former United captain Roy Keane has been one of many United legends who have constantly suggested the Portuguese playmaker is not the man to lead a team that has fallen short of expectations during his time as captain.",
      "Now Parker, who was a key figure in Sir Alex Ferguson’s first two Premier League title-winning sides in the 1992/93 and 1993/94 season, has served up an equally damning verdict on Fernandes.",
      "Speaking exclusively to Football365 with British Gambler, the former England full-back was scathing in his verdict on the midfielder’s suitability to lead the team to success.",
      "READ: Are Man Utd ‘moving in the right direction’? Or did win ‘highlight’ biggest problem ahead of Amorim sack?",
      "“Bruno is not a leader,” declared Parker. “He’s somebody who suits the game at the moment in time when everyone is relying on statistics to make their judgements.",
      "“When Bruno hasn’t played well, they throw up his stats and everything says ‘wow’, but it’s not all about that.",
      "“You can’t mention him in the same breath as someone like Roy Keane. If you are going to be judged on what you do over 90 minutes, I think Roy would put him in his place on numerous occasions. So would former United captains like Steve Bruce and Bryan Robson. Established players would not stand for any player who behaves in that manner.",
      "“I was fortunate enough to play in a generation where we had a few leaders. One player had the armband, but there were a few lieutenants out there. That was a different era.",
      "“Football isn’t like that any more because of the way people are being brought up now. There are not many people who want to lead from the front in this world.",
      "“You’ve also got managers who don’t want people to lead. You have managers who want to play a certain system and they don’t want players who have an opinion. That’s why we are not seeing people grabbing hold of the game any more and leading from the front.”",
      "Parker went in to suggest United should be aiming high in a Premier League season that has thrown up so many unexpected storylines so far.",
      "With champions Liverpool struggling and all the top teams dropping points, Parker believes anything less than qualification for the Champions League may be seen as failure for manager Ruben Amorim, as he compared table toppers Arsenal to the kind of team they had when George Graham was their manager in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",
      "“If the manager doesn’t have the expectations to get into the top four or five this season, then he needs to get out of the job,” added Parker.",
      "“The way the Premier League is going this season, anything is possible. If Amorim could get 30 per-cent more out of his players, they could win the league with the way it’s going at the moment.",
      "“You look at where the points are at the moment and it says it all. The levels we are seeing is poor and the points are being spread all over the place.",
      "“If you are a neutral, you are probably enjoying it and we might be seeing a bit of 2016 here when Leicester won it.",
      "“A few weeks ago, everyone wanted to pay out on Arsenal and say the title race was over, but I am looking at them and they are not that good.",
      "“You are looking at a well-rounded George Graham team that has spent more money. They have shown more consistency than the other teams at the moment, but the levels are not good this season.",

      "“Naturally, the person who gave me this transfer rumour didn’t cite Stellini as his source.”",

      "We are 15 games in and Manchester United are currently 6th in the league, just outside CL places albeit at the head of the very bunched mid table. We could easily drop back to 10th or worse over the festive season given three of our best performers are off to AFCON shortly. We’ve been infuriatingly inconsistent and had some horror show performances and results.",
      "Our new signings all look promising in their own way. Mbeumo is a ready made premier league grade performer. Cunha feels like he should have done more by now, but you know the quality is there, as is the attitude (more on that later). Sesko offers more that he gets credit for and I’ve no doubt he will be a success for the long term whilst Lemmens provides a semblance of competency and calmness in goal which is more than we could have wished for in years.",

      "Instead, United got the game won and just coasted to the end. No urgency, no realisation of the opportunity that was still there. When the assistant signaled 9 minutes to go, you would expect a surge to try and really make the most of it but it just fizzled out.",
      "It’s this attitude that tells us United are not ready to actually go for it. They are coasting by default, and they have talented players so that will get you to a certain point. That internal switch has not flipped to activate the ruthlessness and determination needed to compete at the highest level. You need to relentlessly pursue every edge to succeed. At 4-1 against that Wolves team you should be furious that you conceded one and didn’t score more.  Until they figure that out, they will always remain an inconsistent nearly team.\nAkillies",

      "And of course placing Casemiro with Bruno in the middle means little-to-no control centrally. The system makes the absolute worst use of this group of players. And it’s simply proven. Amorim’s win percentage isn’t bad for a Manchester United manager – it’s bad for a relegation candidate manager. It should be utterly unimaginable that a club with United’s ambition would persist with someone this bad. And yet. Here we are, with many pundits saying no matter what Amorim has til the end of the season. My point is simply: why?",

      "Last I checked – the existence of Salah in a Liverpool shirt has brought the first ever and a second PL for Liverpool (after a 30 year wait that engulfs Carra’s career – but, yes, this is “his” club) and a Champions League (and multiple other opportunities to add more).  Other players were necessary for this to happen (list your VVDs, Manes, Hendos, Wijnaldums, Firminos, Trents, Robbos, and, yes, Origis here) but does this not begin and end with Salah?",
      "The rise of Liverpool predates Alisson and Van Dijk – it was Salah who began to uplift the club from also-ran, Gerrard-slipping bottlers to the status they have now with his insane 17-18 season. Without him the team that was built around him never happens. Klopp knew what he had and acted accordingly.",
      "But I somewhat digress – the point is this: what has Salah said that literally every supporter in the media, on Twitter, in this mailbox or in private hasn’t said?",
      "Slot is sh*tting the bed – why should Salah watch KONATE (????) and Gakpo and even MacAllister (who while still not playing well has finally stopped being completely sh*t, at least, fair f***s) play every week regardless yet he – who won both POTY awards *checks notes* 6 months ago – has to watch them? Because Slot thinks he knows what he’s doing when he hasn’t shown an inkling of how to arrest this slide? Why are the results – the same way they were happening before – stil happening when Salah’s off the pitch?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that Slot won’t start Chiesa instead of Gakpo on the left? Or Rio. Or literally anyone else from time to time, at least?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that the form of Konate and VVD leave you thinking they are angling for a step down to a Championship team?",
      "Is it Mo’s fault the midfield is as formidable as soggy bread?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that Slot keeps benching Liverpools best player so far this season (Ekitike) to get in the more expensive guy who clearly isn’t up to match fitness?",
      "No, it’s not. And all Salah did – in not the best way, admittedly – was question why the clearly overall best and most impactful player in the squad (Salah, duh) was being benched by a manager who is failing to get the basics right.",
      "Don’t get side tracked by Mo talking about what he’s done for the club because he clearly wouldn’t care about being on the bench if Liverpool were, you know,  not continuing to play like shite while he is unable to do anything about it. Think about it – what did Salah say that Carragher wasn’t lamenting about on that candid CBS camera that caught him during the PSV match? Was Carra not saying to someone in the phone that Slot continuing to start Konate was a sackable offense?",
      "All Salah did was do what every other Liverpool supporter doesn’t have the power to do and put these issues – because they are issues – front and center in front of everyone but particularly the board of his club. And it’s not like he’s stupid enough to think his words wouldn’t cause a big deal – it’s obviously why he did what he did in the fashion that he did it in.",
      "Knowing he could get crucified – he stuck his neck out for what he thinks is best for the club. Which is moving on from this manager which, in turn, is something many, many Liverpool fans including Carra himself has suggested might be the way forward. For a large contingent of Liverpool supporters who don’t think this manager has what it takes – he spoke for them.",
      "And he’s getting slayed for it like this? It’s ridiculous and goes to show how players just sometimes can’t say anything without being judged to the highest of extremes.",
      "And he should give the finger to the board – they just spent 400 million to not improve the team! What is everyone on about?\nMAW, LA Gooner (Carra insinuating he was a nobody and Liverpool made him is absurd. He came in and promptly broke the PL single season goal record – how’s Isak for 80 million more doing in this regard, btw – and immediately made them contenders for a trophy they had yet to win going back 25 years. Absurd.)",

The breaks will take place regardless of the time the game is played and the temperature, so it definitely seems more like a chance to run more ads rather than player safety. After all, if player safety was a real driver, why not have it in a country where extreme temperatures isn’t a concern?",

I agree that he is the worst but I can’t ever see him being deposed from his current position as he has the overwhelming support of the majority of the federations. I remember back in the 90’s it was as easy for a European team to qualify for the World Cup as the Euros, such was the relative strength of the European countries and the way the competition was set up to favour the strongest teams qualification. As the years passed and competition numbers expanded the tournament became more inclusive but the standard probably dropped overall. This was probably unwelcome from a European and South American perspective, but very welcome in the rest of the world (where most of the people live).",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League card and tips up a 7/1 treble.",
      "December into January always exposes fragility within a camp and Chelsea are showing the same cracks that appeared this time last year, when they stumbled through the Christmas period without a win in four including losing at Ipswich.",
      "Enzo Maresca is a process manager but the caveat with those types is clear - his teams are best when fresh. As Chelsea boss his record of 15 wins from 20 matches when his teams enter a game after five days or more between fixtures, tells that story.",
      "Give him time and the performances pop. Take away the rest? It all becomes hard work.",
      "The Club World Cup, Champions League travel and commitments, an emotional load on a young squad is all leaving a mark. You can see it in their late-game legs in the recent defeats to Atalanta and Leeds.",
      "Everton, on the back of four wins in five, should arrive buoyant and confident of an upset with the 11/4 with Sky Bet on the draw no bet or the 6/5 on the double chance offering some tasty value to bite on.",
      "Taking the opposition shots lines against Liverpool at Anfield isn't usually a betting theory to explore - but under Fabian Hürzeler, Brighton are not a normal team when visiting the elite and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shots bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 10 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under this manager's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 16.1 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.78 expected goals per game. That is outrageous output. That is title-contender chance creation from a side that aren't sniffing anywhere near a title challenge.",
      "Brighton consistently punch holes in high-pressing, high-line systems because Hurzeler refuses to change his principles. The reward? Buckets of shots and a puncher's chance of a result.",
      "We can jump on Brighton to register 12 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "A key edge to exploit in betting card markets revolves around the referee appointment. Prices lean heavily on team and league averages while one of the most influential factors - the referee - remains oddly under-weighted in how odds are compiled.",
      "Sky Bet have pitched under 3.5 cards at 10/11 here - a fair line based on the averages - but referee identity is everything in this market and Michael Oliver radically changes the story.",
      "Oliver is a fascinating case study this season.",
      "Once one of the Premier League's stricter enforcers, he has taken a notable turn toward a more hands-off approach. Whether that's a conscious stylistic evolution or simply the natural rhythm of the matches he's overseen, the data tells us he's averaging just 2.3 cards per 90 minutes in the Premier League this season.",
      "Finding value when a team is priced at heavy odds-on is an art-form that the best gamblers out there can consistently nail. Arsenal are 1/10 to beat Wolves with Sky Bet - a price that tells you the market sees this as little more than a formality.",
      "There are ways to turn short-odds juggernauts into something far more backable. And adding a goals angle is often the cleanest route, as we have done with success this season on Arsenal. Our old friend of Arsenal to win and under 3.5 goals at 10/11 with Sky Bet is the line that appeals.",
      "Arsenal don't do goal-glut football. Quite the opposite, really. Across all competitions, their matches are averaging just 2.67 goals per 90 minutes, a surprisingly modest return for a team perceived as a free-flowing force. Mikel Arteta's men have seen 14 of their wins this season land the 3.5 goals too.",
      "This is how they operate. They strangle games, not stretch them, so this one looks unlikely to get out of hand for Wolves.",
      "Crystal Palace have managed to score seven goals in the last four meetings with Manchester City, so the both teams to score angle is lighting up like a Christmas tree - but the market is fully aligned at a very skinny 4/9 with Sky Bet.",
      "However, there is a smarter way to attack this angle.",
      "The sharper play regarding goals is to back the players who score them better than anyone else in the Premier League in Erling Haaland and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who as a pair can be backed at 100/30 to both find the net through the BuildABet function with Sky Bet.",
      "Haaland feels like a cheat code most weeks, but it's the other name on the ticket that unlocks the price. Mateta has quietly transformed from cult figure to legitimate Premier League hotshot, and the numbers back it up. In 2025 the two most prolific strikers in the Premier League are Haaland (23 goals) and Mateta (17).",
      "Nottingham Forest are still having issues defending set-pieces.",
      "Eleven goals conceded from such situations - the joint-most in the Premier League - paints a pretty ugly picture, but the deeper numbers are even more damning. Forest are allowing a goal from a set-piece once every six shots they face from those scenarios.",
      "And if you're looking to find value in Tottenham matches, set-piece angles remain a fruitful way to do it. Thomas Frank takes this part of the game very seriously - the master of the marginal gain and with seven Premier League goals from corners this season, it puts Spurs second that particular metric behind Arsenal with eight.",
      "Cristian Romero scores goals like he defends - with commitment, aggression and a hint of melodrama. Spurs have increasingly tailored their deliveries to target him as the first contact and he bagged twice in the 2-2 draw with Newcastle. At 15/2 with Sky Bet he's worth a swing in the anytime goalscorer market.",
      "But the underlying numbers? They're waving a big red flag. According to Opta's expected points model, Sunderland should be 19th - behind Wolves.",
      "If you repeatedly win tight matches while flirting with losing the underlying battle and then lose matches by a big number on the metrics, it usually means an overperformance is occurring. It is here.",
      "Strip away the emotion, the vibes, the narrative fluff, the Granit Xhaka love-in and the Black Cats' performances put them second-bottom in the metrics that usually matter most when it comes to assessing overall performance level.",
      "And when a team's results and numbers stretch this far apart, that elastic tends to snap at some point. It could do here, where Newcastle look the call at 5/4 with Sky Bet for the away win.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo and Unai Emery have crossed paths nine times as managers across the Premier League and LaLiga. And on eight of those nine occasions, both teams have scored. Different squads, different countries, different contexts but the same outcome of goals.",
      "Emery's obsession with vertical runners and brave build-up, up against Nuno's knack for soaking up pressure but always offering a threat on the break often produces a game where both teams have enough space to land a punch.",
      "Under Nuno, the Hammers are still working through some growing pains, too. The spirit has improved, the structure is taking shape, but the balance isn't quite there. Six of West Ham's last seven games have seen both teams score. It should land again with the draw also looking a big runner.",
      "Combining both those angles yields a 3/1 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "In the world of player fouls markets, edges don't last long. A tactical shift here, a role tweak there and suddenly a player who usually draws one cheap free-kick a game is being clattered at a much higher rate. The trick is catching the moment before the market does.",
      "And that's why Dominic Calvert-Lewin to be fouled at least twice at 5/4 with Sky Bet is a bet to consider.",
      "The recent change in Leeds' approach to a far more direct style in their last three matches, funnelled straight into Calvert-Lewin, has completely altered the foul dynamic around him. He's the target for long diagonals, flick-ons and contested duels and he's drawn six fouls drawn in his last two-and-a-half appearances for Leeds.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, aren't shy about contact and their centre-backs defend aggressively meaning this price on Calvert-Lewin is a value call.",
      "There are certain annual traditions you can set your watch by as Christmas comes into view. Mariah Carey defrosting after 11 months of inactivity and Andoni Iraola teams becoming very difficult to beat.",
      "Under Iraola, Bournemouth have played 14 Premier League games in December, losing just two, while winning seven and drawing five.",
      "His high-intensity, high-repetition style tends to hit peak sharpness as other teams begin to creak under the festive fixture pile-up. Bournemouth's broader form supports the case for them too.",
      "They're unbeaten in four meetings with Manchester United and stylistically they're one of the worst types of teams for Ruben Amorim's side to face in that they are full of energy, are tactically drilled and relentless in transition.",
      "United are still swinging between being functional and fortunate still. But one thing that is consistent is how unreliable they are. Bournemouth draw no bet at 2/1 with Sky Bet it is.",
      "1pt treble on: Everton double chance, Arsenal to win & under 3.5 goals & under 3.5 cards in Fulham vs Burnley (7/1 with Sky Bet)",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Kaveh Solhekol",
      "Wednesday 10 December 2025 16:29, UK",
      "Joshua Zirkzee wants to stay at Manchester United to fight for his place in the squad amid interest from Roma.",
      "United are aware of the interest but are not thought to be actively looking to sell Zirkzee when the transfer window opens - and he has recently made an impact in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "He started up front against West Ham on December 14 and was a late substitute in the 4-1 win at Wolves four days later.",
      "Amorim is short of forward options given a recent injury to Benjamin Sesko, although Matheus Cunha has returned from a spell on the sidelines.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations in the coming week, with the tournament starting on December 21. The final takes place on January 18.",
      "The United forward has a contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2029, with the option of another 12 months.",
      "Zirkzee has made three starts in the Premier League this term and named in Amorim's first XI in three of United's last four games. He has played a total of 345 minutes, scoring once.",
      "A glance at Joshua Zirkzee's numbers this season, or indeed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, would suggest that allowing him to leave in January would be no great loss to Manchester United.",
      "Clearly, the forward has not managed to do much to impress Ruben Amorim. United's elaborate £207m spend on three new forwards in this most recent transfer window tells you as much. In total, Zirkzee has scored eight goals in all competitions across a fairly underwhelming 18 months in United colours. Physicality has been an issue, and productivity under pressure hard to come by.",
      "But, and this is important, United at this juncture cannot spare him. His smart equaliser from a tight angle in last month's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace showed glimpses of what he's about and why United signed him in the first place. Amorim singled him out for praise after that performance.",
      "Besides, options are few. The loss of Bryan Mbeumo surely necessitates he stays beyond January, even if he's only used from the bench. United do not have the same bounty of forwards with Mbeumo gone and Sesko injured as many of their closest rivals, and that alone is perhaps argument enough for Zirkzee to stay put.",

      "Toti Gomes had to clear off the line from Matheus Cunha, returning to face his former club, and at that stage Wolves looked there for the taking. But as has often been the case under Amorim, United surrendered the initiative, allowing the bottom club back in.",
      "The home side sensed it, Ki-Jana Hoever's cross finding David Moller Wolfe who put the ball back into the box for Bellegarde, Wolves' best player before going off injured, to force home smartly. The first goal of Edwards' reign coming in his fourth game in charge.",
      "But more hapless defending from Wolves allowed United to restore their lead early in the second half, Dalot again racing through down the left channel before squaring for Mbeumo to slot into the net with Johnstone stranded for his first goal in exactly a month.",
      "A moment of quality from Fernandes saw him dink the ball into the path of Mount for the third goal before Yerson Mosquera was adjudged to have handballed in the area, allowing Fernandes to smash in his second from the spot. Wolves were well beaten.",
      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",
