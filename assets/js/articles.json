      "Oliver Glasner has confirmed that he will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season. The Palace manager's current contract expires in June and the Austrian has decided not to sign a new one.",
      "He is understood to be one of the names being considered by Manchester United, who will appoint a new long-term boss in the summer after appointing Michael Carrick as interim head coach until the end of the season.",
      "“I already informed the club months ago that I wanted a new challenge,” Glasner said on Friday in a press conference. \"We had a very long talk, and I told him (chairman Steve Parish) I will not sign a new contract.",
      "\"We agreed at the time it was the best to keep it between us. It's the best that we could do that and keep it confidential for three months. But now it's important to have clarity, and we had a very busy schedule so that's why we didn't want to talk about it. Steve and I want the best for Crystal Palace.\"",
      "Glasner joined Palace from Eintracht Frankfurt in February 2024 to replace Roy Hodgson. He helped Palace win the FA Cup last season and has won 41 of his 95 matches in charge.",
      "His final decision comes after he promised to 'intensify' talks with the Palace hierarchy earlier this month. “I think in the next weeks, we will intensify the talks,\" he said ahead of the FA Cup tie against Macclesfield, which they went on to lose.",
      "\"With Macclesfield, Friday again, we go up north, and then everyone gets three days off after Macclesfield and then we have to target four regular weeks and in those weeks we will intensify the talks and I expect to find a final decision.”",
      "Glasner is on United's radar following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this month. The Austrian coach favours the same 3-4-3 tactical system as the fired Amorim and United are on the lookout for a long-term successor after handing the reins to Carrick.",
      "United's hierarchy, led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, are leading the search for a new manager. Glasner is among the names they are considering along with Carrick, England boss Thomas Tuchel and ex-Three Lions coach Gareth Southgate.",
      "Speaking last week, Glasner added: “There has been speculation since I arrived. So, believe me, I don't really care about it. I can sign today, or a player can sign a contract extension today and leave in summer. That's why for me, the length of a contract in these times doesn't say anything about your future.\"",
      "Palace were dumped out of the FA Cup by non-league Macclesfield last weekend and are currently 13th in the Premier League ahead of their trip to Sunderland on Saturday afternoon. They are winless in nine games across all competitions and are also set to lose captain Marc Guehi, who is on the brink of a transfer to Manchester City in the January window.",

      "German icon Toni Kroos has lifted the lid on how he nearly joined Manchester United - only for the club to give David Moyes the boot whilst negotiations were still underway. Moyes was handpicked as Sir Alex Ferguson's successor at Old Trafford when the Scottish great hung up his boots in 2013.",
      "The former Everton boss found life tough at United and was shown the door after a mere 10 months in the hot seat. But before his departure, the Scotsman was busy trying to strengthen his squad.",
      "Kroos is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders of his era and landing him would have been a massive statement signing for United. The German maestro was just 24 at the time and plying his trade at Bayern Munich.",
      "Reports suggested he was keen on making the switch to the Premier League under Moyes. But Kroos' career path veered dramatically when United made the call to axe Moyes - whilst he was still in discussions with the midfielder.",
      "Speaking to SPORT1, Kroos said: \"In 2014, before I signed with Real Madrid, I had already agreed with Manchester United.",
      "\"That would have been a move from Bayern to United. But then they kicked out David Moyes, who I was still sitting on my couch with in Munich and hired Louis van Gaal. Then we both declined with thanks.\"",
      "Kroos opted to sign for Madrid when Carlo Ancelotti was at the helm of Los Blancos. He bagged a host of trophies in Spain, including five Champions Leagues, five Club World Cups, four UEFA Super Cups, four La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey and four Spanish Super Cups.",
      "Toni Kroos could have joined Man United(Image: Sebastian Frej/)",
      "Kroos wasn't the only big-name signing that eluded Moyes. The former West Ham boss also missed out on Gareth Bale and Cesc Fabregas during his tenure at United.",
      "Reflecting on this in 2016, he said: \"When I first went in to United my real target was Gareth Bale. I felt all along that Gareth Bale was a Manchester United player and I fought to get him [from Tottenham ] right up until the last minute.",
      "David Moyes was sacked by Man United after just ten months(Image: 2014 Getty Images)",

      "\"The other one I came really close to getting was Cesc Fabregas, who we thought we would get [from Barcelona ] right up until the last minute. And Sir Alex [Ferguson] had told me there was always a chance Cristiano Ronaldo might come back from Real Madrid.\"",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has landed himself a new job just days after being overlooked for the Manchester United job as he joins the Netherlands.",
      "The former Dutch striker, who scored 35 goals in 70 games for his national side, will come in as an assistant from February and work under Ronald Koeman. Van Nistelrooy has been out of work since he was axed by Leicester in the summer following their relegation.",
      "The 49-year-old has previously served as an assistant at Old Trafford and, for a brief period, was the caretaker following the sacking of Erik ten Hag. Van Nistelrooy was then among three men considered for the head coach role until the end of the season.",
      "He and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were edged out by Michael Carrick with Van Nistelrooy not even meeting the hierarchy, unlike the other two men. He had worked with Manchester bosses last season and they felt they knew what he would bring.",
      "Despite being overlooked Van Nistelrooy has quickly found himself back in a job with the Netherlands bringing him into the fold for a second time, just months out from the World Cup as they bid to win a first major tournament since 1988.",
      "A statement read: \"Ruud van Nistelrooy will be part of the Dutch national team's coaching staff from February 1. The former striker will join Ronald Koeman as an assistant coach in preparation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Welcome back, Ruud!\"",
      "One of Van Nistelrooy's early coaching gigs saw him form part of Louis van Gaal's staff at the 2014 World Cup. He has also enjoyed managerial success in his homeland, taking charge of former club PSV and winning the Dutch Cup during his year at the helm, where he had a 64 percent win rate.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy was appointed by Leicester shortly after his spell with Man United, but was dismissed at the end of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Dutch made the semi-finals of the last major tournament, eventually losing to England in dramatic circumstance in the last four. Koeman has retained his job ahead of the World Cup where the Netherlands will be among the European sides fancying their chances.",
      "They have been drawn in a group with Japan and Tunisia with the fourth team still to be determined by a play-off. Koeman has said: “Maybe we are not considered the big favourite to win it, but we are a team that can surprise everybody.”",

      "Michael Carrick has taken over Manchester United training (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has welcomed Habeeb Ogunneye into his training sessions this week after taking over as Manchester United’s interim head coach. Carrick has been preparing his players for the Manchester Derby on Saturday, but hasn’t missed the opportunity to take a look at the club’s academy players.",
      "The former United midfielder was announced as the new boss on Tuesday evening and has a daunting first task against City. He quickly assembled a coaching staff and got to work at Carrington with the players who had been led by Darren Fletcher after Ruben Amorim was sacked.",
      "Carrick is keen to put his own stamp on the side and included Ogunneye, a 20-year-old defender, in sessions. Ogunneye was recently recalled from a loan spell at Newport County and was given a chance to catch the eye by training with the senior squad.",
      "The route from the academy to the first team has been there for all to see recently, with Jack Fletcher and Shea Lacey given game time. However, The Sun reports that the plan is for Ogunneye to be sent out on another loan for the second half of the season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! ** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "He fell down the pecking order at Newport after Dave Hughes – a former United academy coach – was sacked as manager and replaced by Christian Fuchs. The right-back will continue to train at Carrington before another move is lined up.",
      "Nevertheless, his involvement is an example of Carrick’s desire to create an even stronger link between academy and first team, which is shown by the inclusion of Travis Binnion on his coaching staff. Binnion has been promoted from his role as lead coach for United’s under-21s, having also previously worked as the academy's head of player development and coaching.",
      "Carrick was asked to reflect on the recent inclusions of academy players in the first team on the Inside Carrington podcast. \"I've absolutely loved it. Everyone needs a chance, you know. Every younger player needs a chance and wants a chance. It's up to them to then earn the opportunity,” he said.",
      "Habeeb Ogunneye has trained with the Manchester United first team this week(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "“That's always something I've been passionate about. Even when I was playing, if a younger player comes into the group, into the squad, I would be helping them and trying to guide them and give them advice. Seeing them flourish and almost fly because they've got that feeling they play for the first team and they've got that opportunity to come on the pitch.",
      "“It's what this club has seen for so long and what we are all excited about. It's what the fans want to see, that freshness and rawness and unpredictable talent. So, for me to work with the players, to try to help them and give them opportunities, I'm definitely all for that because that's what this place should be.”",

      "Gary Lineker has playfully predicted that Manchester United will name Michael Carrick as manager, only to give him the boot by December. The former Match of the Day host labelled the club as \"bonkers\" in light of a tumultuous 18 months.",
      "Ruben Amorim was given his marching orders by United last Monday after a falling out with the club figures. His tenure at Old Trafford came to an abrupt halt just hours after his tirade following their 1-1 stalemate with Leeds United.",
      "Lineker anticipates that Carrick will shine during his temporary stint at the Theatre of Dreams, leading to a full-time appointment. However, he predicts the ex-Middlesbrough boss will be shown the door next season.",
      "Discussing their pre-season forecasts on the Rest is Football podcast, the 65-year-old told Alan Shearer and Micah Richards: \"Manchester United, here we go, I said mid-table to get into any European competition would be a bonus. I'll stick with that, thank you.",

      "\"My prediction is that Michael Carrick will do pretty well for the remainder of the season, they'll give him the job and he'll be fired by about November (or) December because that club is just bonkers at the minute.\"",

      "Carrick has not been afforded much time to implement his ideas since being appointed as interim head coach until the end of the season. But Manchester United fans will be hoping the fabled new manager bounce can kickstart their season against their rivals.",
      "Pep Guardiola is on a roll and will surely spoil Michael Carrick’s big day. It is set up for a huge occasion and an opportunity for Manchester United’s latest manager. But it is hard to see United boss Carrick and his merry band stopping Manchester City when they get on a roll.",
      "It will definitely be a huge test for City’s resolve because United’s move to appoint their former player will give Old Trafford one hell of a lift and genuine hope of a place in next season’s Champions League places. There will be a buzz about United’s first line-up because it feels as if Carrick may be able to take the shackles off and be more attacking and entertaining than under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But City boss Guardiola needs the wins and, after dropping points lately and defensive frailties, they looked to be back in an ominous groove at Newcastle in the Carabao Cup in midweek. City need to get going in this title race - and I think they will.",

      "Pep Guardiola will face off with Micahel Carrick this weekend(Image: Getty Images)",
      "It will take a fair old new-manager bounce for United to get one over on Pep Guardiola’s side but this will be no procession for City. United will not only get a lift from the personable Michael Carrick, they will get a surge of adrenaline from the returning Amad and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Despite a clean sheet at Newcastle in midweek, this City team is vulnerable to the counter attack and Carrick’s squad has plenty of attacking threat, if not clinical firepower. Amad might not start but Carrick will surely let Mbeumo loose and United can get at City in wide attacking areas.",
      "There will be goals in this contest for the home team - it will just be the age-old question of whether they can stop the visitors scoring more. And against a City team that is unbeaten in 13 matches, that will be a big ask. The likes of Antoine Semenyo and Rayan Cherki look in prime form, to the extent where Phil Foden is not a guaranteed starter at Old Trafford. Considering his excellence in the first half of the season, that is frightening.",
      "It will not be cagey, it will not be pedestrian. For the neutral, it should be a great watch. And not for the first time this season, United could play their part in an entertaining, high-scoring draw.",

      "Antoine Semenyo has hit the ground running since making his move to Manchester City(Image: (Photo by Alex Livesey - Danehouse/Getty Images))",

      "And that isn't being pulled off across three days at Carrington. It will take time. Carrick may have a slight advantage in knowing Guardiola and City may struggle to assess what his team may or may not do given this is his first outing.",
      "But those from the blue half remain in title contention and underlined their quality with a win at Newcastle during the week. They know they can ill-afford anymore draws if they're to catch Arsenal and Antoine Semenyo seems to have given them a new energy. I can't see anything other than a City win.",
      "Prediction: Man Utd 0-2 Man City",
      "Call it new-manager bounce or sheer determination not to lose the derby - and seriously damage City’s title challenge - but Michael Carrick’s side can get a point at Old Trafford. Manchester United have had a woeful few seasons and last few weeks. But their record against Pep Guardiola’s team has been better, including the FA Cup final win and two draws last season.",
      "Expect more tactical flexibility from Carrick and another fresh start from his players. Benjamin Sesko has finally found his scoring boots and City’s depleted defence does concede goals. It is time the front trident with Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha fires together.",
      "Stopping Erling Haaland at the other end is the big challenge but the Norwegian has only scored one in six. He does have five goals and three assists in three matches against Man Utd. It is will be fast and furious and a good result for Arsenal",
      "Prediction: Man Utd 1-1 Man City",
      "Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are back for Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The romantics in red will believe Manchester United can produce a shock win. Michael Carrick will be taking charge of his first game, is a popular figure in the dressing room, while United will have home backing behind them.",
      "And United have pulled off some unexpected derby wins before. But the realists will know there is more chance of Manchester City emerging triumphant.",
      "The bottom line is that United have been dreadful in recent weeks, while City, despite having some injuries to contend with, have the better players in all departments. Most notably in attack, where United are missing Bryan Mbeumo and relying on the unpredictable Benjamin Sesko for goals, while City have a certain Erling Haaland leading the line. Haaland will be desperate to take down his neighbours.",
      "Prediction: Man Utd 0-2 Man City",
      "I expect there will be a new manager bounce off the pitch at least with the atmosphere at Old Trafford stepping up a notch for the visit of City.",
      "Michael Carrick is a bona-fide United legend and will have the immediate backing of the Stretford End. But the fact remains United aren't very good and City are. Even with a couple of injury issues I expect them to have too much for United. Antoine Semenyo has had an immediate impact and I fancy him to have a big say here too.",
      "Erling Haaland has been quiet by his standards in the last few weeks but this is exactly the kind of game that gets his juices pumping. United to come out of the blocks quickly, maybe even take the lead. But City's quality to shine through in the end.",
      "Prediction: Man Utd 1-3 Man City",
      "Erling Haaland is an obvious threat for Manchester City(Image: Getty Images)",
      "After beating him in the race to become the latest holder of the poisoned chalice, Carrick will need to take a leaf out of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s book. Incredibly, the Norwegian had a winning Premier League record vs Guardiola as United boss, beating him three times, drawing once and losing twice in their six meetings.",
      "United will be hoping for the similar sort of bounce they enjoyed under Solskjaer, unfortunately for Carrick the team still has huge limitations. The return of Mbeumo and Amad will help, but as Darren Fletcher showed, vibes and talk of the ‘United Way’ isn’t enough for this group of players.",

It's been a busy month at Old Trafford, with the United hierarchy scrambling to find a replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese manager was given his marching orders at the start of the year, despite showing signs of improvement compared to the dismal 15th-place finish in 2024/25. Darren Fletcher stepped in temporarily for matches against Burnley and Brighton, before Michael Carrick was handed the interim manager's role earlier this week.",

      "Michael Carrick will lead United at Old Trafford in the Manchester Derby this weekend(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United welcome Manchester City to Old Trafford this weekend for the highly anticipated Manchester derby, with Michael Carrick stepping in for his second stint as interim manager.",
      "Carrick faces a daunting start to his tenure, with back-to-back fixtures against local rivals City and, the following week, league leaders Arsenal. United’s recent league form has been underwhelming, managing just three wins in their last ten matches and currently enduring a four-game winless streak across all competitions, following a recent defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion. The timing of Carrick’s appointment could prove pivotal, as the club’s decision to wait until this week has left him with minimal time to implement changes on the training ground.",
      "Despite ranking among the league’s top scorers with 36 goals, United have struggled defensively, registering only two clean sheets all season—a worrying statistic as they prepare to face a Manchester City side boasting the Premier League’s most prolific attack, with 45 goals to their name.",
      "City enter the derby as favourites to complete the league double over their rivals. Pep Guardiola’s side are in outstanding form, unbeaten in their last 13 matches following a win at St. James’ Park. In the league, City have not lost since their 2-1 defeat at Newcastle United in November, winning six and drawing three of their last nine games. The Citizens have also claimed victory in three of the last six league encounters between the two teams.",
      "City will be confident heading into the clash, especially given the uncertainty surrounding Carrick’s impact in his first game back in charge. With United’s defensive frailties and City missing key defenders Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol, an open, high-scoring affair could be on the cards.",
      "Manchester United continue to be without Noussair Mazraoui, who is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, and defender Matthijs de Ligt, sidelined with a back injury. Teenage forward Shea Lacey is also unavailable due to suspension following his late red card in last weekend’s FA Cup loss to Brighton.",
      "However, manager Michael Carrick will have attacking options Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo back at his disposal after both were eliminated from AFCON. Mbeumo, United’s top scorer this season with seven goals, is likely to start on the right wing.",
      "Carrick, expected to stick with a back four, faces some selection decisions—particularly at left-back, where he must choose between Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu. In midfield, Kobbie Mainoo will be hoping to make his first Premier League start of the season, competing with Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount for a place in the lineup.",
      "On the Manchester City side, Josko Gvardiol (tibial fracture), Mateo Kovacic (ankle/heel), John Stones (thigh), Ruben Dias, Oscar Bobb (both hamstring), and Savinho (unspecified) are all out with injuries. Omar Marmoush remains on international duty with Egypt at AFCON.",
      "Antoine Semenyo, who has scored three goals in his last four appearances against United, is a strong candidate to start on either wing for City. Playmaker Rayan Cherki, who found the net in midweek, could be recalled to the starting lineup, potentially at the expense of Jeremy Doku.",
      "At the back, Max Alleyne has impressed since returning from his loan at Watford, winning 92% of his duels for City this season (12 out of 13), including all six aerial contests. The 20-year-old could be rewarded with another start at centre-back alongside Abdukodir Khusanov.",

      "The Blues axed Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day and moved quick to replace him, bringing in Liam Rosenior from Strasbourg. The former player has a CV that reads Derby, Hull and the French side, but he's yet to work in the top flight despite his rising reputation.",
      "He's won one and lost one of his two games in charge, but his appointment follows a trend from the ownership that has seen them go for managers with potential - Graham Potter and Maresca among them - rather than pursue big names as was the case in the past.",
      "United meanwhile sacked Ruben Amorim and bought in Michael Carrick until the end of the season. Bar a three-match caretaker spell, he too has never held a top job in the Premier League. His managerial history coming with Middlesbrough.",
      "Carragher claims the big name manager is almost being killed off and both aforementioned clubs have not hired the best individual, despite both having potential.",
      "He wrote in the Telegraph: \"For those working their way through a shortlist of suitable candidates, there has to be a key, overriding question: 'Does this coach give us the best chance of winning the Premier League?' With respect to Rosenior and Carrick, the answer is no.",
      "\"They may become brilliant coaches. If they go on to have stellar coaching careers, those who backed and identified their potential to manage at the highest level will deserve applause.

      "The Nottingham Forest ace, previously on Newcastle's books, was looking for regular minutes earlier in his career and dropped down to League Two. Initially those from the Memorial Stadium had their sights on someone else, with Anderson proving a back-up option.",
      "So much so that they originally weren't keen on taking the then Newcastle youngster on loan. Even when he arrived he was told that opportunities were likely going to be at a premium, but Anderson's quality quickly had them changing their mind.",
      "His quality later had Barton, who would lead Bristol Rovers to promotion that season in dramatic style, giving him a nickname that drew comparisons with the great Diego Maradona.",
      "Anderson told the Daily Mail: \"I was struggling to get a loan and Joey said he could only do it in the summer. I was gutted but then he said: 'Go on then, we will.' So I go down and they told me they were originally after someone else and that it was going to be really tough for me to get in the team as they were winning. It was fine.",
      "\"That's exactly why I had stepped out of my comfort level. To try to play in a senior team. Then after training the next day I think they just thought, 'Oh, OK… he can actually play'. I came on at half-time of the first game – Sutton away – and basically played every one after that. I never looked back.’",
      "Barton would make it clear to Anderson, then still a teenager, that England recognition was within his sights after being hugely impressed with what he could offer. The man nicknamed the 'Geordie Maradona' crediting the former Manchester City midfielder with having a huge influence on his development.",
      "Elliot Anderson's development was aided by a loan at Bristol Rovers(Image: )",
      "\"I loved working under him,\" Anderson said. \"He helped me so much when I was there. He was just really nice to me and gave me that platform to go and play. Joey’s message to me was about believing in myself. He played once for England and just used to say to me: 'If I have got one cap, then you can get a hundred.' That really lifted me.\"",
      "Anderson's England exploits have seen his stock skyrocket with Manchester United now keen on a summer move. The midfielder admitting that he wouldn't be where he is had he not been sold by Newcastle for £35m, with his form at the City Ground proving crucial.",

      "Bruno Fernandes is believed to be unsettled(Image: PETER POWELL, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Bruno Fernandes' reasons for quitting a previous club should raise alarm bells about his future at Manchester United. There are reportedly fears around Old Trafford club that the captain has had enough of the continued turmoil and will push for a move.",
      "Fernandes was close to the recently sacked Ruben Amorim, who has been replaced by Michael Carrick for the rest of the season before a new permanent boss is appointed in the summer. The 31-year-old will not be going anywhere this month but the rest of the season could be crucial to his future.",
      "If United continue to struggle, it could push him closer to the exit door. Only last summer, he considered switching to the Saudi Pro League before Amorim persuaded him to stay.",
      "Fernandes was in a similar situation at Udinese earlier in his career, deciding to move on for two clear reasons: The team's underperformance and the departure of a manager he had a strong bond with.",
      "The playmaker moved to Italy aged 17 and spent five years in the country, initially joining Novara before moving to Udinese in 2013.",
      "After an impressive first season in Udin, head coach Francesco Guidolin stepped away from his role to become technical supervisor for club owner Giampaolo Pozzo, whose son, Gino, owns Watford. Guidolin later had a brief spell in charge of Swansea City, then in the Premier League.",
      "Guidolin's departure played a part in Fernandes leaving for Sampdoria on loan in 2016 before his permanent move to Sporting CP the following year.",
      "Fernandes was close to Ruben Amorim(Image: Getty Images)",
      "In a stark parallel to his time at United, Fernandes recalled Udinese having quality players but not being able to produce what was expected of them.",
      "He said once told Cronache di Spogliatoio: \"The three years I spent at Udinese were not easy in terms of the team because we didn't have great campaigns, except for the first one, where we had a great squad. We had a strong team, but we weren't able to achieve what was expected of us.",
      "Fernandes during his three years at Udinese(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Then in the second and third year they decided to change manager after so long with Guidolin, and it didn’t go very well. Guidolin had managed to get the most of my abilities and made me understand that I had to train more, but he had faith in me.\"",
      "United fans will be hoping history doesn't repeat itself. Fernandes has 18 months left on his United deal with the option of a further 12 months, meaning this summer could be crunch time for his future at the club. Bayern Munich are reportedly among the clubs monitoring the situation.",

      "Bruno Fernandes will not push for an exit from Manchester United in January despite the changes at Old Trafford following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese star remains the team's talisman and there were suggestions that the change in the dugout may see him consider his future. A move away was touted in the summer with Saudi Arabian clubs particularly keen in the 31-year-old.",
      "But The Sun reports that Fernandes will stick it out in Manchester before deciding on his next move following the World Cup. Interest from the Middle East remains whilst teams in Europe will keep tabs and there of course remains the possibility that he stays put.",
      "Fernandes, despite his age, remains one of the club's most expensive assets. He is also their most consistent performer and often cited as a bright light in a team that has regularly underwhelmed.",
      "He made it clear that he was hurt by the club's summer stance, which saw them willing to cash in on Fernandes if a suitable offer came in. The club left it up to the player, knowing they would either retain a quality individual or receive huge sums, and that struck a chord with the ex-Sporting Lisbon man.",
      "Fernandes has told Canal 11: “From the club’s side, it felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a bit. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player who has nothing to criticise. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. But it gets to a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.",
      "“The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors that, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision, because the manager wanted me. If I had said I wanted to leave, they would have let me go.”",
      "The sacking of Ruben Amorim has not changed Bruno Fernandes' plans(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Fernandes has been in Manchester since January 2020 and is regarded as the club's best signing in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. United remain confident that they can secure some of their major summer targets with midfield still a particular area of concern.",
      "They will not make any moves in January with the men on their shortlist not available until the summer. Brighton's Carlos Baleba was on their radar last summer whilst they're also keen on Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson - the duo likely to feature for England at the World Cup in America.",

      "Michael Carrick has honed his communication skills doing media work(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Had things gone differently at Manchester United, then Michael Carrick would have been sitting in a TV studio on Saturday, not inside the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "Since being dismissed by Middlesbrough in June, Carrick had been enjoying his first proper break from the game. He’d spent almost his entire life inside the professional football bubble up until then, having gone straight into coaching on Jose Mourinho’s staff after retiring from playing in 2018.",
      "Carrick suddenly had more time to spend with his family and on the golf course, yet made sure to keep in touch with football through media work. And had he not beaten his former colleague Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the United interim head coach role, then he would have spent the day with Steve Bower, who has known him for 25 years.",
      "Bower is lead presenter for the Premier League’s global TV channel and has enjoyed spending time with Carrick during the 2025/26 season. The 44-year-old has covered around seven games for the channel, which is broadcast around the world and watched by millions, and has made a real impression with his punditry.",
      "“He is an outstanding pundit,” says Bower, who is also a commentator on Match of the Day. “He speaks like he plays and manages; he would never go low and lambast somebody or go high and give ridiculous praise, he’d look at it from every angle.",
      "“I’ve been doing this for over 30 years so I’ve seen all the categories of pundits and he’s a natural at talking about football. He’s a football nut and he understands the game – and when you look at how he played in that position, it’s quite easy to see why.",
      "“He is outstanding at explaining the why and how, not just saying what we can all see. When he’s talking you can hear the production staff in my ear go silent because they’re just listening to him, fascinated because they’re all football fans.",
      "Michael Carrick talking to Steve Bower in his role as a pundit(Image: )",
      "“He’s part of a small group of people we use – Glenn Hoddle, Michael Owen, Alan Shearer – where you watch games and you learn something over 90 minutes. Michael is in that category: he’s top drawer.”",
      "Punditry and coaching are the two most well-trodden paths for players post-retirement, but being a success in both is not a given. Carrick has made a success of both so far, but coaching was always the first love.",
      "Bower conducted Carrick’s first interview as a United player for MUTV after he signed from Tottenham in 2006. He now counts himself as a friend and has seen first-hand how deeply he thinks about the game.",
      "“Michael went into coaching because Mourinho said ‘I want you’. So he finished as a player on the Wednesday and started as a coach on the Thursday – it wasn’t something he was planning. You take a route and things happen.",
      "Michael Carrick worked on Prime Video's Champions League coverage this season(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "He was United caretaker for three games back in 2021(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“By the end of those three games at United [as caretaker in 2021], when I spoke to him he was like: ‘Yeah, I fancy this, but it’s got to be the right one’.”",
      "Three years, the Championship play-off semi-finals and a Carabao Cup semi-final followed at Middlesbrough and now he’s back where he felt most at home during his playing career. So will his hours in the studio, spent analysing Ruben Amorim’s team and articulating his thoughts, stand him in good stead for the job?",
      "“It does help with the analysis side of it, absolutely, because if he hadn’t done that, and he was just watching Manchester United from the TV screen, or in the stands, you see a different game, you don’t watch it in the same way,” Bower says. “The fact he’s been doing that and predominantly watching this United team will certainly give him a headstart.”",
      "Michael Carrick has jumped into training this week with Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "“I think that whatever happens, even if they don’t get back into the Champions League or Europa League, I think he will,” Bower says. “His phone has probably been buzzing before United, but he was adamant he wanted a break. But this can only be a positive for his coaching career personally.",
      "“For instance, if things go badly at Spurs, he’d be right at the top of their list, surely. It’s a no-brainer for him. Whatever happens, I don’t think it’s going to damage him in any way.”",
      "Carrick is determined to make a good go of his second spell as United’s caretaker – and this time he has new strings to his bow.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been linked with a move away from Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has a hectic first month at the helm of Manchester United in store. Not only will the 44-year-old have to work quickly to get to grips with the squad the interim head coach has inherited from Ruben Amorim, but he may also have to accommodate exits and arrivals.",
      "The January transfer window is in full swing at present, with a number of players linked with moves to and from Old Trafford. And while United are not expected to stray from their plans to remain with their current crop of talent this month, that hasn't prevented the rumour mill from churning.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is not thought to be looking for the exit at United this month. The club captain has been linked with a number of Saudi sides as of recent, including Al-Ittihad, Al-Nassr and Al Hilal.",
      "Recent reports also suggested that Fernandes is considering his future with his current club following the sacking of Amorim. The 31-year-old met with one of his former head coach's backroom staff, Carlos Fernandes, in the aftermath, heightening concerns that he could be looking to follow Amorim out the door.",
      "However, a new reports from BBC Sport highlights that sources have claimed Fernandes is committed to the task at hand with United for the rest of the season. It is understood that he will assess his options in the summer, when he enters his final year of contract with the Red Devils.",
      "Bruno Fernandes looks to be staying with Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United are believed to hold a longstanding interest in the Frenchman, who has racked up eight Premier League goals in 21 games for the Eagles this season alone. Should Juventus accelerate discussions for Mateta, it could probe other interested clubs to also chase his signature.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta has been linked with Juventus(Image: Getty Images)",
      "That could in-turn prompt United to finally enter the race for the striker, or risk missing out on ever seeing him ply his trade at the Theatre of Dreams. United currently have a number of options to choose from up top, with Benjamin Sesko leading the line at present, supported by Matheus Cunha - who can also operate as a No. 9 but has dropped into an attacking midfield role this season.",
      "As per reports, Palace will expect around £30million to let Mateta leave this month, although that figure could rise if the interest is there.",
      "United fans will have to wait a little longer to find out what the future holds for Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, as Fabrizio Romano claims that \"there are no signals from United,\" with regard to movement this month.",
      "Roma remain admirers of Zirkzee despite recently welcoming Robinio Vaz while they are looking to bring in Donyell Malen. The Dutchman is also thought to be open to a return to Serie A, but the ball remains in United's court.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee could be looking for a Man united exit(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Elsewhere, Napoli are thought to hold an interest in Mainoo, who is reportedly aggrieved by a lack of consistent playing time as of recent. It remains to be seen what Carrick's intentions are for the midfielder, especially considering the Red Devils' faith has been instilled in Fernandes and Casemiro for the bulk of the season.",
      "However, Carrick may be wise to hold discussions with Mainoo and Zirkzee before deadline day lands on February 2, so everyone is on the same page.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting Murillo for a summer transfer, but they might have some difficulty in persuading the Nottingham Forest star. Murillo has emerged as a target for United as they consider replacements for Harry Maguire this summer.",
      "Maguire’s contract with United is due to expire in June and the club’s recruitment department is planning ahead by considering possible replacements. Murillo has impressed since joining Forest from Corinthians for £10million in 2023 and is understood to be open to leaving at the end of the 2025/26 campaign, despite signing a new deal a year ago.",
      "United are keen on both the defender and the midfielder, but know they will face fierce competition, especially if they don’t get back into Europe under Michael Carrick’s guidance. In the case of Murillo, they also have his stated desire to play for their biggest rivals.",
      "The 23-year-old told the Benja Me Mucho podcast a year ago: “I had the dream of playing in the Premier League and I had that thought. I thought, ‘I’ll go to Nottingham Forest, have a good year and then I’ll go to a big club’.",
      "“I had that in my head. I’d choose Manchester City but it would be more difficult for me to be a regular starter given the players they have in their squad. There’s City, Arsenal as well who are fighting for the Premier League title. I wouldn’t discard Liverpool either. It would be a good opportunity for me to show my football in a big club.”",
      "Back in January 2025, it was Liverpool who were most strongly linked to Murillo and the Reds will also be on the lookout for centre-backs this summer, with Ibrahima Konate’s current deal set to expire.",

      "United have long been in the market for midfield reinforcements, with Anderson among a host of names being mentioned as potential targets.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Wolves' Joao Gomes and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have all been mentioned as possible arrivals at Old Trafford in recent months, alongside Anderson.",

Anderson shone for England's Under-21s last summer at the Euro U21 Championships in Slovakia, with the Young Lions triumphing over Germany in the final.",

      "We'll bring you updates from Carrick's press conference in 25 minutes.",
      "Carrick is set to speak to journalists at 2pm, but we'll bring you quotes from the 2.30pm embargo.",
      "\"Really impressed,\" he said about Carrick. \"I know Carras from before, and I spoke really highly of him. He was a magnificent coach when he was here under Ole. He's got great ideas, he speaks really well, and tactically he's really good.",
      "\"Now he's had a lot of experience at Middlesbrough as a manager and I'm sure he's going to come here and implement his ideas. He's a legend of the club, and I'm sure the fans will get right behind him, but I must say, with him and all of his coaching staff, I've been really impressed this week.\"",
      "I think it's the right time to recall Maguire to the starting XI this weekend. Some may feel that Cunha should be dropped to accomodate Amad, but I'd give the Brazilian another roll of the dice in a big game.",
      "City are the favourites to win at Old Trafford.",
      "United vs City odds",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "Carrick was appointed as United's head coach on Tuesday evening.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"I guess Michael Carrick's thinking will be that he has to steady the ship and from a personal point-of-view, he's got a great chance of staking a claim to take the job permanently.",
      "\"He's taken his own staff in there which I think was really important to do. The experience of Steve Holland and he obviously worked with Jonathan Woodgate before at Middlesbrough.",
      "\"Michael will be wanting to do a good job so he can stake a claim to take it long-term, that's what his motivation will be. Darren Fletcher managed one defeat and a draw so that didn't work but it'll be fascinating to see what Michael does differently to try and get the team up the table.",
      "\"They've got no cup competitions; the only target is to try and get into Europe and that's what he'll try to do. Man United probably didn't have a choice when it came to hiring another interim manager.",
      "\"They were probably in a situation where, and it bides them time, that Michael's connections will make his appointment go down well with the crowd. It gives Man United a chance to breathe and weigh up the situation to see where they go from now until the end of the season. Getting someone in from now until the end of the season was probably the only choice Man United had.",
      "\"Michael used to be at the same club as I was, Wallsend Boys Club. I never played with him and never worked with him, but I know him and have done little bits with him. He's very measured. I don't know what happened at Middlesbrough, but I know he tried to play front-foot, attacking football.",
      "\"It's a sensible appointment for Man United and it'll be really interesting to see what he can do with that team. It's purely going to be a game per week from now. He's got 17 games to get them into Europe.",
      "\"I think Michael will handle the pressure of the job like he did being a player there. He'll relish it. He's very calm, measured in what he does, and I think he'll be exactly the same as he was on the pitch.",
      "\"Michael isn't a magician, and there's no doubt that some of the players in that team are under-performing and have been for a while. It'll be fascinating to see whether he can get a tune out of them and drag them up the league.\"",
      "Michael Carrick spent just under a year out of the game after his stint as Manchester United caretaker, taking over at Middlesbrough for his first full-time managerial role. Carrick made an immediate impact, impressing Boro fans with a progressive style of play and guiding the club into the play-offs.",
      "Carrick took the job with Middlesbrough in a Championship relegation battle, but they ended the season by having a crack at promotion to the Premier League, with Carrick winning 16 of his first 23 league games.",
      "It began to unravel for Carrick in his second year in charge at the Riverside Stadium. The former United midfielder oversaw an eighth-placed finish, missing out on the play-offs, and there was regression in his third campaign, which resulted in a disappointing 10th-placed finish.",
      "Carrick was backed in the transfer market in the summer of 2024 but failed to meet expectations, which ultimately led to his dismissal. Carrick had been out of work since his departure from Middlesbrough, but now has the chance to manage the club that he represented for 464 games as a player.",
      "Read the full article here.",
      "United are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach. Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions.",
      "It's understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window.",
      "United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.",
      "Carrick has just 17 games to oversee in the Premier League due to United's early exits from cup competitions, and the 44-year-old will try to steer the club into the Champions League.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Hello and welcome to our press conference blog.",
      "This will be Carrick's first chance to speak to the media since he was appointed interim head coach.",
      "United are expected to appoint a permanent replacement for Amorim in the summer. However, whether that plan changes if Carrick excels remains to be seen. Only qualification for next season's Champions League will be seen as a success between now and the end of the season. The road towards that starts tomorrow lunchtime.",
      "Stay tuned for updates from Carrick's press conference..."

      "There are plenty of questions to answer at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "A lot can change in a week and the last time we answered your Manchester United questions it looked like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be the man in the Old Trafford dugout for this weekend's Manchester derby. Instead, Michael Carrick is the man who will aim to oversee a win against United's city rivals.",
      "The former Middlesbrough boss impressed Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox during the interview process and has been handed the reins until the end of the season. Everyone wants to know what we can expect to see from the new man in charge and who the winners and losers will be from his appointment, and we'll look to answer some of those questions in this week's Q&A.",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions so click here to submit your questions and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "What is the plan of the board of directors to bring the glory days back to United?",
      "A nice, easy one to start with. The board of directors have essentially given control of football matters to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox. So their plan is for Berrada and Wilcox to get things right. As for the plan of Berrada and Wilcox, well, who knows?",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "This isn't hindsight; I have consistently said that the appointment of Amorim was a strange one for a club looking to move away from a dominant head coach/manager. Amorim has one of the most distinctive playing systems in Europe and the only way that can work is by signing him specialists.",
      "The one positive recently has been recruitment, which was better in the summer. But the decision on who to appoint next is vital and could make or break this Ineos regime. Berrada has championed Project 150, which is a desire to win the league in the club's 150th anniversary season in 2027/28. Right now those look like hollow words and bland executive speak.",
      "The plan right now has to be get the right head coach. Do that and things might fall into place, but there is no escaping the fact that the structure of ownership and the combination of the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe make success a challenge for this club at the moment.",
      "What is Carrick's formation?",
      "He was a 4-2-3-1 man at Middlesbrough and I would imagine we will see that again. That was the system Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played at United and Carrick kept it during his three games in charge.",
      "That kind of shape can easily become a 4-3-3 if one of the two sitting midfielders moves forward, but I imagine it will be more of a cautious set-up for now, given the first two games are against Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Give Lacey a chance - Cunha and Dalot are not worth United shirts.",
      "Lacey has started to get a chance of late and I think he will stay in and around the first-team set-up. His problem now is Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are back and after this weekend (when Lacey is suspended) there are only 16 games left of the season. As talented as Lacey is, I don't think anyone can suggest he should be starting games ahead of Amad or Mbeumo right now.",
      "Cunha has had a slow start to his Old Trafford career. I thought there were positive signs in mid-December but he's gone off the boil again. With Amad and Mbeumo away, he should have grabbed this team by the scruff of the neck, but he's gone back to playing with the handbrake on. I wouldn't be giving up on him any time soon, though. We have seen there is a very good Premier League player in there.",
      "Let's get Xabi Alonso - he's a man with vision and a winning mentality.",
      "Alonso feels like a difficult appointment, given his Liverpool connections, but I do think he would be a very good one. I wouldn't hold what happened at Real Madrid against him; that place chews up and spits out coaches and Alonso's desire to actually try and change the culture should be seen as a positive, if anything.",
      "But there is a good chance Alonso is next in line at Anfield and he would have to ask himself if he was willing to blow up the chance of ever coaching Liverpool by moving to United. I'm not sure I can see it.",
      "Why is Harry Maguire not starting as well as Shea Lacey and Kobbie Mainoo?",
      "Maguire has just returned from injury and needs to get back to full fitness. I would have him in central defence alongside Martinez at the moment, but he had two months out and needs to make sure he is fully recovered.",
      "I don't think there has been an obvious time to start Lacey and with all the attacking players now back, I don't think he gets a start anytime soon. His development is going along just fine if he stays around the first-team squad.",
      "As for Mainoo, I think we all know why he wasn't starting under Amorim. He just didn't trust the 20-year-old in his midfield. I'd be amazed if Carrick didn't hand him more opportunities.",
      "Why don't the club send Diogo Dalot out on loan?",
      "Not sure I see any merit in this, to be honest. Dalot is 26, there is no point sending him on loan to develop and he is the first-choice right-back and a member of the leadership group.",
      "He's had a difficult season and the criticism of him from supporters has been noticeably louder this year. I'm not sure he's the long-term answer at right-back but there is no replacement ready to go either. Even if Noussair Mazraoui takes that place next week, Dalot would be needed as back-up.",
      "There is probably an argument to sign a right-back in the summer, although midfield has to be the priority. It feels inevitable that Dalot will face more competition at some point.",

      "Carrick was confirmed as head coach on Wednesday.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Michael Carrick spent just under a year out of the game after his stint as Manchester United caretaker, taking over at Middlesbrough for his first full-time managerial role. Carrick made an immediate impact, impressing Boro fans with a progressive style of play and guiding the club into the play-offs.",
      "Carrick took the job with Middlesbrough in a Championship relegation battle, but they ended the season by having a crack at promotion to the Premier League, with Carrick winning 16 of his first 23 league games.",

Carrick had been out of work since his departure from Middlesbrough, but now has the chance to manage the club that he represented for 464 games as a player.",
      "United announced Carrick's appointment as head coach on Tuesday. He will be supported by a backroom staff of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Carrick was undefeated in three games as United caretaker in 2021/22, and he had the confidence to drop Cristiano Ronaldo, but there is a larger body of evidence from his time at Middlesbrough to provide meaningful insight into what to expect from him as interim for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "Dominic Shaw, sports reporter at The Northern Echo, covered Carrick's stint at Middlesbrough. \"I think there has to be an element of surprise considering he ultimately failed to get Middlesbrough promoted,\" he said.",
      "\"But the appointment also feels understandable at the same time, given the position United are in and Carrick's association with the club.",
      "\"What will be interesting is what happens if Carrick can repeat at Old Trafford the immediate impact he had at Middlesbrough. His appointment was initially transformational at Boro and his side should, in truth, have won promotion in that first season. That was the high point of his time on Teesside.",
      "\"In his last season, Aaron Danks seemed to be a big miss after his departure to join Vincent Kompany's staff at Bayern Munich. With that in mind, the Steve Holland appointment feels wise.\"",
      "Carrick celebrates a win in February 2023.(Image: 2023 Getty Images)",
      "Shaw described Carrick's tenure at Middlesbrough as mixed. \"As mentioned above, Boro were brilliant for large spells of his first season after he took charge in October 2022,\" he explained.",
      "\"For a spell in the second half of the season they were the best team in the Championship, but they came up short in their bid to catch the top two and then lost in the play-offs.",
      "\"That resulted in an exodus of star players and loanees, so the following campaign was very much a season of transition, though Boro still reached the last four of the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"Last season was a disappointment. The aim was promotion, but Boro underachieved and came up well short, finishing 10th. After a long review at the end of the season, Boro officials decided it was time for change. Most Boro fans agreed.\"",
      "So what went wrong? Carrick was accused of stubbornness and his plan became stale. \"In his first season, the football on offer was as good as Boro fans have seen in a long time,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"But come last year, Boro were too often predictable and ponderous in attack, and at the other end they gave away a string of shambolic goals. Their game-management - or lack of it - let them down again and again and they threw away countless points from position of dominance in games. One criticism that Carrick didn't like but was fair was that his side was soft-centred. It lacked steel and leadership.\"",
      "Carrick during his first training session as head coach.(Image: )",
      "Carrick operated with 4-2-3-1 at Middlesbrough and is expected to use that formation at United. \"Carrick craves control. His Boro side were always possession-based and his preference was a 4-2-3-1 shape,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He did move to a back three and wing-backs on a couple of occasions, but it was always clear it was a short-term fix. He wants his goalkeeper and defenders to play out from the back and talked often about the need for his forward players to be 'fluid'.",
      "\"At Boro, he also had huge success in transforming Chuba Akpom into a No.10. Akpom had been signed as a striker but had flopped on Teesside until Carrick moved him into a deeper attacking role, a position he'd never previously played. Akpom was the Championship's Player of the Year in 2022/23 and earned a move to Ajax.",
      "\"He said Carrick was 'the manager he'd been dreaming of his whole career'. Carrick played down his role, saying he'd just followed his instinct after watching Akpom in training.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim was box office during press conferences, sometimes critical of his own players, but Shaw warned that Carrick's appearances with the media will be business-like for the remainder of the season.",
      "\"Don't expect any repeats of the explosive Ruben Amorim press conferences,\" he said. \"Carrick is always extremely measured and reluctant to give too much away. He's fiercely defensive of his players. Never once did he stray close to criticising his players, or club officials for that matter.\"",
      "Shaw added: \"Boro made a huge profit on a number of players during Carrick's time in charge. Morgan Rogers signed for £1m and left in a deal worth £16m. Emmanuel Latte Lath signed for £4m and left for north of £20m. That's obviously testament to Boro's recruitment work, but also Carrick's coaching.",
      "\"He made mistakes at Boro but that was to be expected - it was his first role as a permanent head coach. Now we'll see whether he's learned from them.\"",

      "Michael Carrick asked Manchester United fans to \"come on Saturday with everything you've got\" in a rallying cry ahead of the Manchester derby. Old Trafford was flat last weekend, but the appointment of Carrick and the visit of the noisy neighbours should provoke a reaction on the terraces.",
      "Carrick knows what it means to play against Manchester City. The former midfielder won 12 of his 23 derbies during an outstanding playing career, losing nine and drawing the other two.",
      "It won't be easy to outwit Pep Guardiola in his first game in charge, but Carrick will give it his best shot. The 44-year-old took his first training session on Wednesday, and the quick impact he made as caretaker in 2021, and subsequently as Middlesbrough manager a year later, provides grounds for optimism.",
      "Carrick admitted he made mistakes at Middlesbrough during his unveiling interview with United's club media earlier in the week. There will be no margin for error against the world's best manager.",
      "United will likely have to be almost perfect to secure a victory in the Manchester derby, though the chances of a result are higher now that Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are available again. The pair have been at the Africa Cup of Nations for the last month but they are back at Carrington, which is a timely double boost for Carrick.",
      "Amad and Mbeumo are back from AFCON.(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "United's newly appointed head coach will have an almost full-strength squad against City this weekend, aside from Matthijs de Ligt. The Dutchman has not played since facing Crystal Palace on November 30 due to a back injury, and a source this week confirmed that he is still injured and unless Carrick confirms otherwise, it seems likely he will remain out of action.",
      "Ruben Amorim's options were limited by injury and AFCON in the final weeks of his tenure, while Darren Fletcher had to manage with a weakened squad during his brief stint as caretaker.",
      "Carrick has been afforded a luxury his predecessors did not have. He is about to navigate tougher fixtures, facing the Premier League's two best sides in eight days, but an almost full-strength squad will help.",
      "It will also cause headaches that his predecessors did not have to deal with. Carrick is expected to play 4-2-3-1, which poses the question: Can Amad and Mbeumo play together in that system?",
      "Both players would be best suited to playing on the right flank - and there is only room for one starter on that side. Mbeumo could be moved to the left in order to accommodate Amad on the right, but that seems unlikely in Carrick's first game in charge, given the risk involved.",
      "It's a welcome headache to have, however, considering Matheus Cunha's performances in the last few weeks. The Brazilian must contribute more in the final third and could lose his place if he does not improve.",
      "Cunha must contribute more goals.(Image: )",
      "There is also a question about where Mason Mount fits into the system. He would be best-suited to the central attacking midfield position, but Bruno Fernandes will have that spot nailed down.",
      "Mount finally began to deliver consistently strong performances in a United shirt under Amorim, who spoke glowingly about Mount's quality, and United have been better when he has started this term.",
      "Some United fans would pick Mount without hesitation in their strongest XI for the derby on Saturday, while others may not find room for him.",
      "The extra squad options also raises questions about minutes for emerging academy prospects, like Shea Lacey, who was given two senior appearances by Fletcher. Lacey's cameo against Burnley was promising and he built on that display against Brighton, which was slightly marred by his red card.",
      "Lacey was applauded off the pitch at Old Trafford after receiving two yellows, which felt like recognition of a proper United winger from fans who appreciate old-school wing play.",
      "It would be a mistake to allow Lacey to drift into the background and drop back to the Under-21s for competitive minutes because he's shown enough promise to be around the first-team squad permanently.",
      "So Carrick has a few headaches due to his strengthened options, which can only be a positive.",

      "Good morning and welcome to our Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "It's been a busy week at Old Trafford with Michael Carrick appointed as their interim head coach on a deal until the end of the season and all eyes are now on the club's owners to see if they can bolster his squad before the January transfer window closes.",
      "United have not yet added to their squad this month, with Ruben Amorim's departure putting any transfer activity on the back burner.",
      "However, that hasn't stopped speculation from around the globe with United linked with a number of incoming and outgoing transfers.",
      "Oliver Glasner has publicly confirmed his departure from Crystal Palace at the end of the season amid links to becoming Manchester United's new head coach.",
      "After confirming that Marc Guehi to Manchester City was in the final stages, he said: \"I already informed the club months ago that I wanted a new challenge.",
      "\"I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in the October international break, a dinner, a very long talk and I told him I would not sign a new contract.",

      "Wayne Rooney has urged Michael Carrick and Manchester United to swoop in for any players they have on their radar should they become available this month, via the most-recent instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "The problem United have got at the minute is if players become available now, I think we have to go for them.",
      "Because when it comes to the summer and you're in competition again with the teams who are more successful at the minute, it becomes more difficult to sign the players they want. If the players become available now who you think, 'Yeah,' we can go for him now.",
      "And maybe you're paying over the odds to get him a little bit. I think they have to take it now.",
      "Manchester City could have signed a new player in the January transfer window ahead of the Premier League clash against Manchester United.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy has a new job after being linked with the caretaker manager role at Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Joe Prior/Getty Images))",
      "Former Manchester United star Ruud van Nistelrooy has taken another step back into coaching, with confirmation that the 49-year-old has been appointed as assistant coach for the Dutch national team.",
      "The ex-striker joins Ronald Koeman in position with the 'Oranje', as preparation steps up for the 2026 World Cup that is underway in just a few months' time in Canada, the USA, and Mexico.",
      "It's the third time Van Nistelrooy has taken on the role with the Netherlands, having previously served as an assistant coach from 2014 to 2016 and 2020 to 2021.",
      "That job change comes shortly after he was linked with the caretaker role at Manchester United, with reports claiming that he was in the mix to be handed an opportunity back in the dugout at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dutch coach was introduced into Erik ten Hag's coaching setup back at United in 2024, before the manager's dismissal meant the role of caretaker was down to Van Nistelrooy.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He took charge of four games with the club, winning three and drawing one of those encounters, which includes two wins over Leicester in the Premier League and the Carabao Cup.",
      "Van Nistelrooy would go on to manage the Foxes less than one month after, with Ruben Amorim's appointment at the club confirmed, taking his own path into management in the top division.",
      "An eventual exit came in the summer of 2025, however, after failing to keep Leicester from getting relegated back into the second tier.",
      "There was an opportunity for Van Nistelrooy to pick up where he left off with Man United, with Amorim's sacking earlier this month opening a pathway for him to potentially take the caretaker manager role on once again.",
      "Ruud van Nisterlrooy has been out of work since leaving Leicester City in the summer(Image: Steven Paston/PA Wire.)",
      "However, the eventual decision from the sporting department came down to Michael Carrick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, with the former picking up the role for the rest of the season.",
      "It won't be an easy task for the midfielder-turned-head-coach, who starts off his stint in charge of the team with a Manchester derby clash against close rivals Man City.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "With Carrick's move into the position now confirmed, Van Nistelrooy's own focus will be on what he can do to help guide his nation to the Jules Rimet trophy in the summer.",
      "The Netherlands have been drawn against Japan, Tunisia and one of either Ukraine, Sweden, Poland or Albania in the group stage of the competition.",

Even with Ruben Amorim gone, the importance of bolstering the centre of the park hasn't waned, particularly with interim head coach Michael Carrick likely to revert to a four-at-the-back system, meaning one more man will be needed in midfield.",
      "United have been linked with the likes of Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, but their hefty price tags have thus far deterred the club from making a move. A big arrival in January is unlikely, with United planning to address the midfield issue properly at the end of the season.",
      "Former United defender Stam has identified Barcelona ace De Jong as the perfect target for his former club. The Dutchman, who worked with Stam at Ajax, has a contract with Barcelona until 2029, but the 53-year-old believes he'd be a \"dream\" capture.",
      "\"My dream signing for Manchester United in the January transfer window would be Frenkie de Jong from Barcelona,\" Stam said speaking to Covers.com, reports the Daily Star.",
      "\"United should always be looking at players who can make them play better football, and Frenkie has been on the club's shortlist ever since Erik ten Hag was in charge. I've worked with Frenkie a lot when he was a youngster at Ajax and he really is someone who can make a team play better football.",
      "De Jong's Barcelona contract runs until 2029, making a transfer to United tricky(Image: Getty Images)",

      "United were strongly linked with De Jong throughout Erik ten Hag's time at the club, but the Netherlands international never made the move despite Barcelona pushing for it amid severe financial troubles.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to Barca from Ajax in 2019 and has made 282 appearances for the Catalan side. Yet his position in the team was hardly guaranteed following his red card against Celta Vigo in November, having to wait nearly two months before reclaiming his place in the La Liga side's starting XI, where he also regained the captain's armband.",
      "Stam spent three years at United as a player(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Stam suggested that should De Jong prove unobtainable, United ought to revisit their interest in Brighton's Baleba. \"Elsewhere, Carlos Baleba from Brighton is a very good player and he could do well at Old Trafford,\" he added.",
      "\"I'm always looking at the United's system and how I want them to play, and I believe they would become a better team with Baleba and De Jong in there.\"",

      "Michael Carrick is back at Manchester United as interim manager(Image: PA)",
      "As we near the midpoint of the January transfer window, Manchester United have yet to bolster their squad with new signings. However, there has been a shake-up in the managerial department, with Ruben Amorim being dismissed and Michael Carrick stepping in as interim manager for the remainder of the season.",
      "The appointment of former United midfielder Carrick was announced on Tuesday, and he will be immediately thrust into the thick of things. United are set to host Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, aiming to avenge their 3-0 loss at the Etihad Stadium last September.",
      "It's uncertain whether there will be significant transfer activity given the absence of a permanent manager. Last winter window saw Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven move to Old Trafford, but much of the transfer talk around United appears to relate to the summer window.",
      "Despite this, the potential of rival clubs vying for players on United's radar could alter this approach. Two such players form the focus of our Manchester United transfer round-up.",
      "Wolves midfielder Joao Gomes is among the Premier League talents to be linked with United as they look to strengthen their midfield. The club was already aware that Napoli could pose competition for the Brazilian international, but now another contender has emerged.",
      "Gomes, who transferred to Wolves from Flamengo in 2023, seems to be the perfect fit. However, it's reported that Wolves are eager to retain the midfielder - valued at over £40m - as they continue their battle against relegation.",
      "The 24-year-old was gradually integrated into the squad after signing under Julen Lopetegui in January 2023 but has been a regular since the Spanish manager's exit. He has only missed seven Premier League games since the start of the 2023/24 season and his potential suitors aren't deterred by the fact that his team are 14 points away from safety.",
      "United have long admired Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta but they're not the only ones. Sky Sport Italia reports that Juventus have made a bid for the French international, though Palace appear to be holding out for move than the £30m on the table.",
      "Mateta's contract expires at the end of the 2026/27 season and it has been suggested that his contract situation is responsible for the decrease in the valuation. United were linked in 2025 only to seemingly be put off by an asking price approaching £50m.",
      "Crystal Palace star Jean-Philippe Mateta has plenty of admirers(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former Mainz striker Mateta has netted eight goals in 21 Premier League matches this season, following double-digit tallies in the previous two seasons. The 28-year-old also boasts two goals from three senior appearances for France, having made his debut for Les Bleus in October.",
      "Juventus, who look set to miss out to Roma in the hunt for Donyell Malen, are on the hunt for attacking reinforcements after losing Dusan Vlahovic to injury. Serbian striker Vlahovic, whose contract expires in the summer, hasn't seen action since late November due to an adductor injury.",
      "On the other hand, United filled their striker void with the £73m signing of Benjamin Sesko last summer. However, the Slovenian has yet to fully hit his stride this season, and with Joshua Zirkzee seemingly set for a departure this year, Mateta could continue to be on United's radar.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate has plenty of thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach(Image: PA)",
      "Gareth Southgate says he has no issue with directors of football eroding a manager's authority after Manchester United sacked Ruben Amorim.",
      "The former England boss describes the root cause of Amorim's demise as a power struggle with club executives. United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, who is a former England teammate of Southgate's, won out in the end.",
      "While debating the difference between a manager and a head coach Southgate - previously linked with a move to United - revealed that he insisted on changing his title from head coach to manager after being offered the role. He now refers to himself as a 'leader, manager, coach - in that order'.",
      "A lengthy LinkedIn post titled 'Manager v Head Coach', which Southgate describes as his \"thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach\", reads: \"In the last fortnight, three of Europe's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea have parted company with their head coaches. Of the three, Enzo Maresca served the longest period at 18 months.",
      "\"Although each coach left under slightly different circumstances and for more than one reason, power struggles either with club executives (Amorim), club employees (Maresca) or players (Alonso) were ultimately the root cause of the end of each tenure.",
      "\"The erosion of a manager's authority has been a gradual process over many years. It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of football, technical, or sporting directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the head coach. Personally, I have no issue with this evolution.",
      "\"Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation — and a football club is no different. A head coach neither has the time nor, in many cases, the specialist expertise to manage complex player contracts, oversee global scouting networks, or run sophisticated data operations. Equally, it makes little sense to dismantle medical or sports science departments every time there is a change of head coach.",
      "\"However, in a classic example of Parkinson's Law (where time saved by reducing responsibilities is quickly filled by something else), the modern head coach now finds themselves managing larger squads, bigger backroom teams, far greater analytical demands, and ever-increasing media and commercial obligations.\"",
      "Southgate's comments on backroom teams come days after the announcement that his former England assistant manager, Steve Holland, will support Michael Carrick at United until the end of the season. The former Chelsea assistant is part of the coaching team alongside Craig Mawson, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Southgate's post continues: \"Contrary to the belief of some fans that the role has become simpler (\"they just need to coach\"), the opposite is true. Add to this the complexity of managing modern-day players (many of whom are effectively individual brands), alongside the financial stakes for clubs, and the relentless scrutiny of both traditional and social media, and you have a significant melting pot of problems and pressure. This is not helped by the subtle, sometimes unintentional, shift in power and status implied by moving from the title of manager to head coach.",
      "\"People may argue that 'it's just a title', or merely semantics. From personal experience, it's not. So much so that when I was offered the role of head coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.",
      "\"You may have noticed that my current LinkedIn title reads 'leader, manager, coach' - in that order. That is entirely intentional. It reflects the hierarchy of skills I believed were required to run the England team effectively.",
      "\"The leader operates in the public eye, engaging fans, setting the vision, shaping the culture, and championing and protecting the players and staff.",
      "\"The manager is 'managing' stakeholders, departments and people, maximising collaboration and making plans stay on track. Oh, and don't forget the role of persuading 25 financially independent elite performers to put collective purpose ahead of their ego.",
      "\"Finally, the coach works on the pitch, setting the style of play, preparing tactics to exploit opponents, and developing the technical abilities of individual players.",
      "\"My belief is that we should embrace a modernised version of the traditional manager, where we recognise the people they lead, manage and coach. As I once said to my bosses at England: players are not magnets on a tactics board that can simply be moved around. They are human beings. And managing that reality is at the heart of modern football leadership.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti has been tentatively linked with the Man United manager's job(Image: Burak Akbulut/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Carlo Ancelotti has previously criticised the Glazers for their management of Manchester United, leading to speculation that the esteemed manager could be a potential candidate to succeed Ruben Amorim in the summer. The Old Trafford hierarchy chose to part ways with Amorim following an outburst that appeared to question his position within the club.",
      "Amorim was the first full-time appointment made by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as part of their joint ownership of United.",
      "With no immediate successor for Amorim in sight, they have appointed Michael Carrick as interim head coach until the end of the season..",
      "Consequently, the list of possible candidates for the summer is expanding, including international managers such as Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, and Julian Nagelsmann who may be available, reports the Mirror.",
      "There's also Ancelotti, currently managing the Brazil national team, whom former United assistant Rene Meulensteen believes should be considered by the club.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he’s done it, he’s seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like,\" Meulensteen said. \"I don’t think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else. Ancelotti would say this is what I’m doing. I’m managing what I’m here to do.",
      "“Football has changed. You’ve got Directors of Football now or Sporting Directors and Technical Directors who are there to safeguard the big picture of the whole football operation at a club and then you’ve got a Head Coach who should be working with the squad of players.",
      "“As a coach, you need to be very clear on that. That’s why Ruben Amorim ran into trouble. They obviously weren’t aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than the people in the background.”",
      "It remains uncertain whether Ancelotti would consider a switch to Old Trafford, or if the club's decision-makers are even considering the former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss. Nevertheless, when it comes to alignment, questions may arise regarding the Glazers' involvement.",
      "Whilst the partial sale saw Ineos and Ratcliffe acquire a minority share of the club, alongside control of footballing matters, the Glazer family retain majority ownership. This could potentially create tension, particularly given Ancelotti's candid remarks about the family back in 2016.",
      "\"I was fortunate to be able to coach Real Madrid, although then the club decided to change managers,\" Ancelotti said.",
      "\"That is part of the job, we are exposed to that. In the big clubs it is difficult to stay a long time because the expectations of results are so high.",
      "\"Madrid’s history and demands mean that if a coach doesn’t win trophies, a change is made. You have to respect that. It’s true that there are other clubs like Manchester United, where [Sir Alex] Ferguson was there many years, and now [Arsene] Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "\"These cases are different, as their owners are from the US and they are more interested in the financial aspect than in who is coach.”",
      "Whether Ancelotti genuinely features on United's shortlist for a new head coach remains uncertain, but speculation will persist about the club's requirements moving forwards. The notion of 'Man United DNA' has become a recurring talking point in debates over the next managerial appointment.",

      "Michael Carrick takes charge of his first United training session(Image: )",
      "It's rarely quiet at Old Trafford but the first two weeks of 2026 have been explosive even for the standards of Manchester United. Michael Carrick is the club's third head coach of the year already.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dramatic end and Darren Fletcher's caretaker spell have led to the appointment of Carrick until the end of the season and the challenge that now awaits is to steer the club back into European competition.",
      "That won't be easy and the start is a daunting one, but there is now a sense of calm at Carrington once more. This is the story of a remarkable two weeks and how United got to the point where 44-year-old Carrick was summoned from a beach in Barbados to take charge of the first-team.",
      "There was frustration bubbling away at Carrington on the second day of 2026, but no sense of the explosion that was about to go off at the club's training ground.",
      "The failure to beat Wolves a few days earlier had stuck in the craw of key executives, particularly given Amorim had gone back to his favoured back three formation. Wolves boss Rob Edwards revealed post-match he had always expected Amorim to do just that, while the United head coach said he had wanted to match up the visitors.",
      "That negative approach set alarm bells ringing again. Amorim had gone to a back four and a more attacking ethos against Bournemouth and Newcastle, but reverted to type for a game against a team that, at that point, were still to win in the Premier League.",
      "When director of football Jason Wilcox spoke to Amorim about it at a pre-planned meeting on the morning of Friday, January 2, the head coach \"blew up\". He hinted at the unhappiness in his press conference ahead of the game and then cancelled a planned broadcast interview.",
      "The Amorim era came to a dramatic end at Leeds(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Two days later, he used the final question of his post-match press conference to essentially air his grievances with Wilcox in public. If it was a power play, it was never going to succeed.",
      "Amorim pulled into Carrington the next morning well aware he was about to be put out of his misery. His dismissal was about results, but it was also about his behaviour, not just in that showdown with Wilcox, but in the public criticisms he had aired against some players as well.",
      "There is a feeling that Amorim never quite 'got' United. He never understood the club's values or bought into the tradition of the type of football they should play. He certainly didn't sound like a United manager at times.",
      "It has been suggested that the 40-year-old was taken aback by the sheer scale of the task at hand and the noise that reverberates around the club. He called out people paying too much attention to pundits in his final press conference, but he has never had to deal with a struggling super club before and the spotlight will always be harsh.",
      "It's something Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag had to come to terms with as well, so with only 17 games left to salvage something from this season, United couldn't afford to appoint someone who needed time to get their feet under the table. That is why Wilcox looked to the days of United's past.",
      "Jonny Evans oversees United training on Wednesday(Image: )",
      "There was some schadenfreude at a shortlist of Carrick, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the nostalgia was deliberate. All three understand the club and are used to the noise. There will be no adaptation period required.",
      "In what became a straight shootout between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former's knowledge of a group of players who are yet to click together this season impressed Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada. He is also a progressive appointment whose best days as a coach might be ahead of him, whereas it feels like Solskjaer's best days in management are in the rearview mirror.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox also felt Carrick could work in a collaborative structure that Ineos are putting together at Old Trafford. He is a hands-on coach, whereas Solskjaer's experience at United is more managerial, although that is partly due to the absence of a clear structure when he was in charge between December 2018 and November 2021.",
      "Carrick's coaching pedigree helped him win the race and it didn't harm his cause that he had made an impact with some of these players as well. His three-game stint as a caretaker in 2021 is remembered fondly, but he also led much of the training when Solskjaer was in charge, along with Kieran McKenna.",
      "He is still a popular figure with some members of that squad who remain at Old Trafford and his ability to quickly assemble a coaching staff has gone down well. In particular, the appointment of experienced No. 2 Steve Holland is considered a wise move.",
      "For a while under Ineos, it felt like the sight of Holland pulling into Carrington was inevitable, alongside former England boss Sir Gareth Southgate. However, interest in Southgate has waned, and Holland's appointment isn't directly related.",
      "Instead, the search is now underway for a permanent head coach, although there is intrigue surrounding the removal of the word 'interim' or 'caretaker' from Carrick's job title. His job is simply that of head coach, albeit on a contract that runs until the end of the 2025/26 season. Solskjaer was named caretaker manager until the end of the 2018 season, and Rangnick was the interim manager in November 2021.",
      "United stresses that those decisions were made under a different regime, and the decision not to use the words 'interim' or 'caretaker' is due to the length of time he will be in charge. The process to appoint a permanent head coach will be a thorough one, but Carrick will inevitably be in the picture. The results will dictate the strength of his case.",
      "Carrick, Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were in place at Carrington on Wednesday morning to welcome the players. There were \"good vibes\" around the place, as one source put it.",
      "Plenty of the squad already know Carrick and some know Holland as well. Carrick's career means he commands respect from the squad. He held a relatively brief introductory team meeting on Wednesday morning before a first training session on the grass which was watched by Wilcox.",
      "Gym work followed for many of the squad, but there were no significant changes implemented by Carrick on day one. Although club media filmed some of the session, there was a desire not to reveal too much.",
      "There will be two more sessions before City arrive on Saturday and the Carrick era truly begins.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the price of Nice for a potential sale of the French club(Image: (Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the asking price of French club OGC Nice, in a continued bid to end his stake in the team.",
      "That's according to Bloomberg, which states that Ineos had been seeking over €200m (£173m) to complete a full sale of the club in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Ratcliffe had put Nice up for sale last year, but there are claims that investors were not willing to pay the asking price for the Ligue 1 outfit, so the price has \"come down significantly\" to aid in offloading them.",
      "The main challenge facing the British billionaire, and the advisory firm Lazard Inc, who were hired to help seal a deal, surrounds uncertainty with the TV deal in France.",
      "DAZN had originally taken on the rights, but after a deal collapsed, Ligue 1 have been managing and distributing their own broadcast deal among clubs.",
      "Any deal for an investor to buy the Ineos stake in Nice would end nearly seven years of the company at the head of the French club, which has come with mixed results.",
      "So far, Les Aiglons sit 14th in the league with just a six-point buffer to the relegation places, while they are yet to register a single point in the Europa League, with criticism coming in for the management of the club in recent years.",
      "It comes at a time when Manchester United face their own challenges and turbulence under the part-ownership of Ineos and Ratcliffe.",
      "There have been signs of improvement, following last season's dismal showing in the Premier League when they finished 15th, but chaos has ensued following the decision to sack Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese coach was the first full-time head coach hired under the new ownership and sporting structure, which has seen Ratcliffe's group attempt to transform the way they operate behind the scenes.",
      "This clearly caused tension for Amorim, who outlined the fact that he wanted to be a manager and not a head coach at the club, despite the new structure featuring a director of football in Jason Wilcox.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said in early January when asked about his optimism with the board.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "His exit, along with the hiring of Michael Carrick as caretaker manager, outlined the need for Ineos to get the next hire right to help push Man United in the right direction again, while there has been some scrutiny over the situation with the departing head coach.",
      "That change in direction will have to coincide with a clear game model implemented from the sporting department, along with the right types of players signed by the recruitment department to play specific roles.",
      "Whether they can create that joined-up thinking in the hierarchy remains to be seen.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester City offer a tough task for Carrick in his first game back at the helm following a previous stint in interim charge, but Maguire – who has just returned from injury to provide an option for him in defence – was full of praise for the former Red Devils midfielder after his first few training sessions.",
      "“[I’ve been] really impressed,” the 32-year-old admitted. “Obviously, I knew Carras from before, and I spoke really highly of him. He was a magnificent coach when he was here under Ole [Gunnar Solskjær].”",
      "Maguire continued, explaining, “He’s got great ideas. He speaks really well. Tactically, he’s really, really good. And obviously, now he’s had a lot of experience at Middlesbrough as a manager. And I’m sure he’s going to come in here and implement his ideas.",

      "When asked whether there has been any signifiacnt difference since Carrick’s arrival, Maguire elaborated that the former England international’s main focus has been upping the energy in training, and that it’s working well.",
      "“I think we haven’t had much time on the grass, but obviously we have had a couple of sessions,” he continued. “And yeah, I think he’s trying to bring new energy, new ideas, without drilling us too much at this moment tactically.",
      "“I think he just wants to bring the energy back in the building, and I think that’s so important. Obviously, this club is scrutinised, a lot of eyes on it all the time, analysed. And a lot of people can lose a little bit of energy within that.",
      "“Michael’s played here, he’s obviously performed in unbelievable teams, and he’s been a magnificent player, so he knows what it’s like to win here and what you need in a team and a group of people and a group of staff.",

      "Gareth Southgate has aimed both a ‘sly dig’ at Manchester United and a ‘nod’ to Sir Jim Ratcliffe over his availability and willingness to work with him.",
      "If Manchester United wanted Southgate to replace Ruben Amorim, he would have done.",
      "So quite why his latest comments have been interpreted as anything other than Southgate discussing the current state of football management is unknown.",
      "",
      "Gareth Southgate taking to LinkedIn to somehow both support and one-up Liam Rosenior’s “if you split the two words it’s ‘man’ and ‘age’ – you’re ageing men” spiel is a great bit.",
      "Those are 14 unimprovable paragraphs on a Leader, Manager, Coach ethos presumably inspired by John Terry, and the modern ‘erosion of a Manager’s authority’. And yes, Southgate obviously capitalises the word ‘manager’. Probably does the same with ‘club’ too, ffs.",
      "Jeremy Cross of the Daily Mirror was among the many to read that Southgate thinkpiece, and he goes with this opening paragraph:",
      "‘The timing of Gareth Southgate’s comments couldn’t be more ironic.’",
      "It’s not exactly like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife, is it? Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid have all dispensed with head coaches recently after losing the ‘power struggles’ of which Southgate speaks.",
      "On goes Cross:",
      "‘Within 48 hours of Steve Holland being parachuted into Manchester United, Southgate has gone public with his views on the current power struggle between managers and club bosses.’",
      "Not entirely sure that Steve Holland or his short-term appointment to a new Manchester United coaching staff is emblematic of ‘the current power struggle between managers and club bosses’ but okay.",
      "Cross continues, quoting Southgate:",
      "‘”The erosion of a manager’s authority has been a gradual process over many years,” he said. “It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of Football, Technical, or Sporting Directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the Head Coach.",
      "‘”Personally, I have no issue with this evolution. Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation – and a football club is no different.”",
      "‘Is it a nod to United co-owner and friend Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he’s still around and available for work?’",
      "No.",
      "Cross ends an almost entirely pointless opinion piece by saying that whatever happens at Manchester United going forward, Southgate ‘is keeping himself relevant’.",
      "By posting his thoughts to 29,137 followers on the hub of viral activity that is LinkedIn? Cross’ definition of ‘relevant’ sounds about as accurate as his grasp of ‘ironic’.",
      "",
      "That Southgate post is manna from heaven for an uncomfortable number of shameless outlets.",
      "The bloke literally wrote about the inherent problems in ‘moving from the title of Manager to Head Coach,’ dismissing the idea it is pure ‘semantics’ and writing:",
      "‘When I was offered the role of Head Coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to Manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.’",
      "A reminder of how Ruben Amorim basically sealed his Manchester United fate.",
      "So yeah, this was no come-and-get-me plea from Southgate, no ‘nod’ to Ratcliffe and Ineos that he is willing to swoop in and rescue them. If that was A Thing then Manchester United would probably have appointed the unemployed man already, instead of just picking his former assistant up for a few months.",
      "We thus get headlines from the likes of usual bastions of reliabilty GBNews, such as ‘Gareth Southgate makes sly dig at Man Utd set-up amid speculation over future aims’.",
      "And the Daily Express website wilfully ignoring Southgate’s point to instead write that he ‘has said he has no problem with directors of football eroding a manager’s authority,’ without stopping even for a second to wonder how batsh*t insane a thing that might be for an actual manager to say.",
      "Happy to confirm what we all suspected: nothing good can possibly ever come of a story based on LinkedIn quotes of all things.",
      "",
      "Mediawatch does not especially disagree with the general sentiment that there are a handful of Premier League clubs who could do with, as Andy Dunn of the Daily Mirror puts it, ‘the ‘ice-cold finisher’ Ivan Toney.",
      "The bloke scored 20 goals in his last full Premier League season less than three years ago. If he is available and affordable then Your Evertons and The West Hams Of This World could probably do with that level of attacking quality – if indeed it still exists after a season and a half in Saudi.",
      "What Dunn can and should be pulled up on is the feigned surprise that Toney is ‘somehow’ not really part of the England conversation any more.",
      "The 29-year-old does indeed have 18 goals in 24 games for Al-Ahli this season, but eight of those have been penalties and he has not scored or assisted in any of his last four appearances for his club and country as a substitute: the role he absolutely would be still playing for England if he was in the picture.",
      "That feels more pertinent than him making someone look silly with a stoppage-time penalty recently.",
      "But as Dunn writes, Toney’s World Cup hopes are basically ‘non-existent’.",
      "‘They should not be,’ he adds, because ‘Toney’s form and composure surely demands Tuchel take another good look at him,’ since having him in the squad means ‘you are taking a penalty taker of the very, very highest order’.",
      "Two points:",
      "1) Are England really still doing the ‘make space in the squad specifically for a specialist penalty taker’ in 2026? They’re all quite good at them now; Toney did score in the shoot-out against Switzerland at Euro 2024 but so did everyone else.",
      "England last missed a penalty in the final of Euro 2020. They definitely need to use a squad spot on someone who won’t play unless there is a sniff of a spot kick.",
      "2) When Jordan Henderson moved to Al-Ettifaq, one writer condemned the ‘significantly lower standard of play’ and ‘mediocrity of the Pro League,’ adding that ‘life in the Saudi Pro League means Henderson’s days in an England shirt are surely coming to an end.",
      "‘He cannot go to the Euros on the back of an entire season in Saudi,’ Dunn added back then. If only Henderson had mugged off Mailson of Al-Taawoun; he’d have been an obvious squad pick.",
      "",
      "‘Jones almost certainly would not refer to himself as a United legend but someone ill-informed in the club’s corporate department thought he was worthy of the title.’",
      "Are things okay at home, Samuel?",
      "Real Betis are honest about their contradictions as the pioneers behind Forever Green, but that and the enlistment of an Arsenal cult hero is why it works.",
      "Many assistant managers work in the shadows – Newcastle’s being the obvious exception – so this week’s Famous Friday Quiz will stretch you…",
      "Roy Keane having a pop at Michael Carrick’s wife only exposed his ‘bitterness’ and laziness, with fellow failed manager Gary Neville just ‘nodding along’.",
      "El Sackico may scandalously be hidden beneath the 3pm Blackout, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t still all sorts of good stuff to watch.",
      "Jurgen Klopp has been very clear about the chances of him returning to day-to-day football management; for the first time, we doubt him.",
      "Arsenal have a couple of representatives a good five decades or so apart in an England D-Team which also has a heavy Spurs influence."

      "Man Utd ‘are desperately seeking to revamp their midfield in the upcoming summer transfer window’ and the Premier League giants ‘have identified the young Spaniard as the ideal playmaker for their new project’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy are convinced that Barrios ‘would bring the clarity and passing ability that the current squad urgently needs to generate attacking football’.",
      "On the potential signing of Barrios, the report adds: ‘The signing of the Spanish Under-21 international reflects a clear intention to rejuvenate the squad with technically gifted players hungry for continental glory. Manchester United doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes and prefers to invest in proven players from top-level leagues rather than unfinished prospects.",

      "“Gallagher has obviously been spoken about as a midfield option but Barrios would actually be a very good fit for what United want long term – and Amorim doesn’t just want a loan in midfield or to sign someone for the sake of it. He wants players that fit the longer vision.",
      "“Atleti won’t want to lose him because he has become very important in their midfield but I think there could be some potential for them to have a fight on their hands to keep Barrios across 2026.”",

      "The former Middlesbrough boss is expected to start with a back four as Darren Fletcher did in his two games in (even more) interim charge, and former Red Devils defender Paul Parker expects Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw – who look set to start as the full-backs – to struggle against City’s wingers.",
      "“Well, you don’t have to be an ex-full-back or an ex-defender. you can be the man on the street, and you know that the full-backs that United have got are going to struggle,” he told Metro via online casinos UK.",
      "“Dalot and Shaw are going to struggle pace-wise. And because there’s no, at this moment, out-and-out defender there, you know they’re going to get exposed in one-against-ones.",
      "“So that’s going to be a big, big problem for Michael Carrick, and generally what it would mean is that you would use one of your wider players to help by trying to help you by not allowing the ball to get to the feet of those players too far up the park.",
      "“When it gets close to the goal and then you’re a little bit more congested as a team, compact, then yes, you can understand it and that makes it easier because there’s more players around. But the last thing you want to be doing is getting caught too far up the park one-against-ones.",
      "“That’s going to be the problem because there’s going to be a lot of acres for people to run in behind. So it’s going to be a massive problem. I don’t know how Michael Carrick is going to deal with that.”",

      "Personal comments about a manager’s wife aren’t honesty or elite standards. They’re what you reach for when there’s nothing left to say about football but you still want the attention. When tactics, structure, and insight dry up, go personal and call it telling it like it is.",
      "It’s hard not to see bitterness underneath it. Keane had his chance in management and was exposed — Sunderland, Ipswich, end of story. The snarling, the shouting, the talk of standards never translated into building a team or managing people. Once that door closed, the managerial career ended and the pundit persona took over.",
      "Between them, they confuse volume with insight and contempt with intelligence. Lecturing from a safe distance is easy when you’re no longer accountable for results, selections, or decisions that actually matter.",
      "Dragging families into it isn’t “telling it like it is”. It’s lazy, snide, and beneath anyone who wants to be taken seriously. It’s what happens when the football content runs out and resentment fills the gap.",

      "Having watched the Chelsae game, Blueco’s strategy reminds me of Baldrick in Black Adder. He always had a ‘Cunning plan’ but when he talked it through it was met with laughter and incredulity.",
      "Watching Arsenal toy with Chelsea under 15’s joined by their PE teachers Cucurella and Sanchez laments a new ownership who has spent the best part of £1.3 billion (Netto as Ruud would say). The absentees of James, Colwill, Caicedo, Palmer and De lap focused the attention to the bench.",
      "It included a Brighton loan, 2 academy players, a free agent, a player who has been injured for 4 months and a goal keeper, £1.3 billion???? It’s a Private Equity business so the reality we are being driven on a model similar to Dortmund. Identify and purchase the best young talent, develop and sell. Next year we should see the arrival of Penders, Sarr, Quenda, Emegha, Barco, average age 20.7!!! The injury to Palmer may buy us an extra year with him, but Cucurella and Fernandez possibly off to City and PSG respectively.",
      "One other observation, although I’m banging on about Chelsea it looks like the majority of the PL is adopting this model. Look at the managers, apart from Guardiola, there is no super managers here. You may make a case for Emery and Arteta if he wins this year. But the rest are definitely potential only.",

      "Interesting to see Garey Vance bring up Wenger’s “daylight” offside proposal this morning. I’d coincidentally read a reference to it a couple of hours previously so it was fresh in the mind.",
      "So far as I can tell, the arguments for a (big) revision to the offside rule are that it will help to clarify the current VAR mess, and that there will be more goals if attackers have more leeway. In theory I suppose they’re both correct, but in practice would it really be the case?",
      "Taking the VAR angle first – the lines don’t go away if the point of intersection between onside/offside is moved. Instead of a toe ahead of the defensive line being the determinant as it is now, we’ll just see a toe intersecting with the last defender’s silhouette. We’ll still be at the mercy of the competence or otherwise of the same set of minions at the PGMOL.",
      "Maybe more important though is the knock-on effect of allowing attackers a generous margin for error when making their runs. Taken in isolation, it sounds great and should allow them to unpick defences with far higher regularity. More chances = more goals, better game to watch, everybody wins.",
      "But how will defenders react to having their margin of error narrowed dramatically? I can only think of one natural response, and that’s to close off the spaces in behind. Start with a line 10-15 yards deeper so they’re in a more secure position when possession turns over, and adopt a low block as a necessity when the opposition has sustained possession.",
      "Of course players will still manage to get in behind when an attack is quick enough or imaginative enough to pull that defence apart, but I’m not convinced that we’d necessarily have a flood of high-scoring games as a result of such a dramatic change to the rule.",
      "No issue with seeing this trialled at some level of the game, it would still be an interesting experiment. But does anyone else think that there should always be a place in the game for defending to be preserved as an art and an appropriate challenge to the attackers?",
      "Football is a low-scoring sport by nature, and that has never prevented it from becoming the most popular game in the world. It can definitely be improved, and VAR reform is definitely part of that. But there has to be a way to align it with the spirit of the game instead of looking to rewrite one of the core laws of the game, doesn’t there?\nKeith Reilly",

      "Wirtz was offside. It was obviously offside. He himself didn’t celebrate as he knew he was offside. The commentary team described it as offside. And both the ref, and the lino, flagged it as offside. Everyone in the ground was on the same page.",
      "However, after a delay, the goal was given.",
      "Not because VAR could prove the ref was wrong, but because they have declared that the technology is not good enough to accurately determine when exactly a ball is kicked, and so to that end being ‘forensic’ about lines on a screen is a faux science. There are therefore ‘thickening the lines’ of offside players to give the benefit of the doubt to the attacking side.",
      "So-as to be consistent with potential future cases which may require the benefit of the doubt, they granted an offside goal.",
      "It is, as far as I am aware, the first instance of VAR over-ruling a correct decision. Or at the very least, of VAR over-ruling an on field decision because the person in a booth could not confirm if the ref was correct.",
      "This breaks the game.",
      "And beyond that, the dangerous loon in a suit who created this law has said it should be ‘good news’ to fans as it rewards attacking play. We are deemed so thick and imbecilic that apparently giving us offside goals that a ref has correctly flagged offside, removes debate and makes the game better.",

      "Rio Ferdinand insists Victor Osimhen would “100% come to Manchester United” if the Red Devils pushed for his signing.",
      "Osimhen has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford and the Premier League in general but signed a four-year deal with Galatasaray in the summer, making his loan move from Napoli permanent for £65m.",
      "He’s scored 49 goals in 57 games for the Turkish giants and has scored an abundance of goals wherever he’s been, in stark contrast to the goal-shy strikers at Manchester United in the last few years.",
      "Well aware of the quality of their asset, Galatasaray have slapped a €14om (£121m) price tag on Osimhen, which is surely beyond the reach of United, who signed Benjamin Sesko in the summer for £74m.",
      "But in conversation with Asamoah Gyan on the Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, Ferdinand insisted that Osimhen would jump at the chance to play for United if they offered him the chance.",
      "“Victor Osimhen, he loves scoring goals, he plays with his heart, and gives everything. I’m surprised big clubs didn’t go for him in this transfer window. Hopefully, I’m feeling Manchester United too, only if he wants to come because of their history and everything,” Gyan said.",
      "Ferdinand then responded, “Osimhen will come to United, if United offer to take Osimhen, he would go, 100%.”",
      "“That is the type of striker we need right now, we have Mbeumo on the side doing what he needs to do,” Gyan then added in conclusion.",
      "Reports have suggested that caretaker boss Michael Carrick looked set to have to make do with what he already has available to him in the United squad, but it was claimed on Thursday that Director of Football Jason Wilcox is prepared to sign a new left winger to bolster his options.",

      "Amorim’s 3-4-3 system with inverted wide players means the current squad is short of out-and-out wingers.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are the only natural wide forwards in the squad and are both right-sided, with the lack of options on the left seen as a ‘major problem’ by Carrick, according to Football Insider.",
      "Matheus Cunha started on the left wing during Man United’s 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup, but is not seen as a long-term option in that position.",
      "Amorim held talks with Antoine Semenyo at the end of last month before he decided to join Manchester City in a £65m deal, and although the United chiefs aren’t willing to spend that money on an alternative, a short-term deal is now on the cards.",

      "“Although it is significant to point out that whilst it wasn’t the crucial factor that led to the sacking of Ruben Amorim a week ago, there was a difference of opinion between Amorim and his bosses here, Jason Wilcox, the director of football, in particular, about whether they should strengthen in January because they are just outside the Champions League places.",

It’s been made clear to me if there is a long-term target who United have had, who becomes available in January at the right price, they will make a move for him, but certainly the changing of the head coach will make no difference to the chase of new transfers.”",

      "After last weekend’s FA Cup action, with its exciting games and baffling refusal to have all of them feature a five-minute delay to check some blurry pictures for where somebody’s toenail might have been, we’re delighted to confirm it’s normal service resumed this weekend. The Barclays is back! VAR is back! What passes for a title race is back!",
      "There are some brilliant games this weekend, as well, and the big twist is the one we all want to watch while pointing and laughing – the most spectacularly beleaguered El Sackico imaginable between Spurs and West Ham – isn’t even on the TV.",
      "That’s how you know the rest must be good. You’d better believe it’s a Big Weekend.",
      "",
      "Can’t say fairer than a Manchester derby for a bit of Saturday lunchtime entertainment, can you?",
      "And let’s be honest, derby games are always most fun when both teams are in what is in modern football always for some reason now called a ‘bad moment’.",
      "Now there are levels to this game. City’s bad moment means winning their two most recent matches 10-1 and 2-0 after slipping off the title race pace with some annoying draws, while for United it means going out of a second domestic cup at the earliest opportunity to ensure this will be their shortest season in terms of matches played since 1915, when there was a literal world war happening.",
      "And also they’ve sacked the manager and replaced him with one of Fergie’s Boys, and then replaced that one of Fergie’s Boys with another one of Fergie’s Boys, who was most recently seen leaving Middlesbrough after not getting them promoted.",
      "So yeah, not quite the same thing. But it does all mean this is a game riddled with glorious uncertainty.",
      "For all the contrasts, both teams’ recent Premier League record is one of irritating draws. The key difference again there being that United’s recent run of irritating draws have been against three of the bottom five.",
      "Even if we accept that drawing at Leeds right now is a halfway acceptable result for anyone given their current resurgence, failing to beat both Burnley and Wolves having somehow managed to fall upwards into Champions League contention is immensely daft.",
      "Ifs and buts never got anyone anywhere, but if United had done everything else the same and just won those two games against the two worst teams in the league they would now be fourth.",
      "Instead they are seventh, with a rookie manager, and about to face City and Arsenal back to back with a retreat right back into the mid-table slop firmly on the cards. But it’s derby day, isn’t it? And you just never know on derby day.",
      "",
      "That’s now four games unbeaten for Wolves in all competitions. It’s not much, but when you consider the record-breaking appallingness of what had gone before, then it is definitely and absolutely something.",
      "Getting Shrewsbury in the cup helped on multiple levels, we fancy. One, a nice easy game to rack up some goals and boost confidence further, obviously, but also a reminder that however bad things might feel for you as a Premier League team – and things have felt really quite abysmally sh*t for Wolves this season – there is always somebody worse off than you. And a team currently hurtling towards double relegation to fall outside the Football League altogether for the first time since the 2003/04 season is certainly that.",
      "In the Premier League, it’s been a win and two draws in the last three for Wolves ahead of a clash with a Newcastle side that has shown the sheer awesome power of three straight wins in this compacted and congested league without ever really looking like they’ve actually compellingly resolved any of the issues that had them rotting in the bottom half to begin with.",
      "",
      "Funny old week at Aston Villa, who’ve spent it proving how much better they are than Tottenham on the field and how little that still means at transfer time. Losing out to Spurs for Conor Gallagher is no catastrophe in itself; he is a good footballer who would have been a useful squad player for Villa’s Champions League push but it is abundantly clear that Spurs’ need for midfield legs is far greater.",
      "It’s more irritating for what it represents; another reminder that PSR rules continue to limit Villa’s gravity-defying efforts just as much as being in Birmingham rather than London does. It’s not ‘unfair’ as many still insist, of course. A level playing field doesn’t mean letting every club spend the same amount of money; it means not letting any club spend more money than they actually have.",
      "But still. It’s annoying, isn’t it? And the financial tightrope Villa continue to walk has had further consequences this week with the departure of Donyell Malen. He’s precisely the sort of good-not-great squad player it can be surprisingly damaging to lose midway through a season going well.",
      "It can cause unexpected ripples and leave a hole where no hole existed before. It leaves a lot of responsibility now on the shoulders of Ollie Watkins, who is suddenly very short of back-up.",
      "Luckily his own form has significantly turned around, more than doubling his Premier League goal tally for the season with four in his last four games, but there is pressure now to continue that form.",
      "Sure, Tammy Abraham is set for a return to the club where he sparkled on loan in the Championship back in 2018/19. But that was a long time ago. He scored 17 Serie A goals for Roma in 21/22 but hasn’t managed more than eight in a league season since.",
      "There is new and significant weight on Watkins’ shoulders now.",
      "",
      "El Sackico itself may be taking place under the grim dark cloak of the 3pm Blackout but that doesn’t mean there isn’t still an under-pressure manager for you to legally watch on your tellybox.",
      "How long is it, we wonder, until Mr Marinakis grows weary of his latest manager’s fumblings and wearily reaches once again for the lever next to his seat that opens the trapdoor he had installed in the home technical area at the City Ground?",
      "Victory over West Ham last time out may have eased the pressure for now, both on Dyche specifically and Forest generally, but crashing out of the FA Cup at Wrexham to make it five defeats in their last six games doesn’t feel like the sort of thing Mr Marinakis is keen on tolerating. This season, especially.",
      "It would seem fair to suggest that, after a disappointing FA Cup banana-skinning, Arsenal would not sit top of the list of teams you would like to be facing next. But that is Forest’s fate.",
      "And if Nuno and West Ham have had any joy at all a couple of hours earlier against the far stupider half of North London, then an awkward evening could be in store.",
      "",
      "The top of the Championship is suddenly all rather more interesting than has looked likely for much of the season with Super Frankie Lampard’s all-conquering Coventry City hitting a sticky patch.

      "Having previously managed a star-studded Barcelona side and a PSG squad full of highly paid players, Enrique has proven he can handle egos.",
      "Alonso reportedly tried to change too much at Madrid, which annoyed several players, and club president Florentino Perez is keen to avoid a similar situation. It is believed Enrique is the ‘strong figure’ players like Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior need.",
      "The biggest issue is that Enrique ‘isn’t a beloved figure among Real Madrid fans’, having left the club for Barcelona in 1996. His relationship with the supporters was strained even further by his success as Blaugrana boss.",
      "If he does replace Alonso, winning games and trophies would win sceptical supporters back over.",
      "The report adds:",
      "The debate is open. From a sporting perspective, Luis Enrique would be one of the most qualified coaches for the challenge. From a social perspective, his appointment would be a bold, even unpopular, move. But the club has made similar decisions in the past when it deemed them necessary.",
      "Real Madrid needs a manager who commands respect from day one. Luis Enrique fits that profile, even if he isn’t the fans’ favorite. In a time of rebuilding, sporting logic can outweigh emotional appeals. That’s why, despite some reservations, Luis Enrique remains a real option to return Real Madrid to the top in La Liga and in Europe.",

      "He has shown an ability to adapt, moving from La Liga to international football and back into club management in a different country. He is clearly a world-class coach.",
      "United do not want a project manager; they want someone capable of restoring their glory days.",
      "The issue is that they do not currently have the players to support that ambition. Enrique’s teams have included Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta, and more recently Ousmane Dembele, Vitinha and Achraf Hakimi.",
      "United arguably have just one world-class player in Bruno Fernandes. The rest of the squad is not close to competing for the Premier League title, and it is even debatable whether they are good enough to finish in the top four.",
      "Enrique would be required to get the best out of a fairly average group of players, which is something he has rarely been asked to do during his managerial career.",

      "Even with one of the most creative forces of the Premier League era, United have still been tough to follow or fathom. It doesn’t bear thinking about how bad things would have been without Fernandes, last season especially, when he scored more goals and offered more assists than any team-mate in a side that finished 15th. Take Fernandes out of that sorry team, and only the wretchedness of the bottom three might have spared United from relegation.",
      "We can only hypothesise over that outcome, but we do know for a fact that Fernandes is one of the top 10 most creative players ever in the Premier League. This is the company he’s keeping…",
      "There are reams of stats to highlight Fernandes’ importance, in a wider Premier League and European context, but most startlingly, to United.",
      "In all but one of his full seasons at Old Trafford, he’s led the way for assists, usually by a long way. In the only season he was second for creativity, in 2020/21, he was United’s top scorer with 28 goals in all competitions, seven more than anyone else. During the darkness of last season, he scored eight more goals than any team-mate and created nine more, 19 of each in total. This term, from a deeper position that doesn’t play to his strengths, he’s had a hand in 14 goals – six more than any other United player.",
      "If his current form was out of the ordinary for Fernandes, it might be suggested that the captain is being fuelled by the ‘hurt’ he felt at United’s apparent willingness to sell him to Saudi last summer. That, above all of the other rotten decisions Ratcliffe, Wilcox and co. have made, would have been the worst of their calamities.",
      "And even a year later, it seems a prospect too stupid even for this leadership group. But you just know that if Fernandes decides he wants a different environment, something perhaps bordering on functional, United would only look at the fee being banked rather than the cost of losing the skipper.",
      "As has already been highlighted, his form is hardly diminishing, and his reliability has never been an issue. Actually, he has showed superhuman levels of robustness, missing three games in nearly six years to injury or illness prior to his recent hamstring injury. From which he recovered in double-quick time.",
      "Fernandes is 31. He’ll be 32 in September. On a spreadsheet, that might be a red flag to any of Ratcliffe’s bean-counters but the Portugal star is far from finished. It’s weird that it even needs to be pointed out. Yet seemingly it does to those at Old Trafford who really should know their skipper better by now.",
      "No wonder Fernandes feels affronted. Not only by how dispensable he is viewed at United, but by the assumption that he will be off to Saudi. Sure, the sheikhs will be queueing up, but so too will be big hitters across Europe. And if the likes Bayern Munich are eager to take him, that in itself ought to prompt someone – anyone – at Old Trafford to suspect that they might be missing the bleedin’ obvious.",
      "MORE: Ian Wright would take Bruno Fernandes at Arsenal ‘tomorrow’",
      "Fernandes’ will, seemingly, is the only reason he remains at United. As he said just last month: “I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.” But you can push anyone only so far.",
      "Wilcox and Ratcliffe ought to be love-bombing Fernandes, or at the very least, making him feel the appreciation that was sorely lacking in the summer. Because hiring a new head coach, especially one of the calibre required, will be even more difficult when candidates learn that the one and only player five of his predecessors have all been able to rely on is being discarded for no good reason.",
      "United are already facing a summer in which they need a new manager and at least one new midfielder. Perhaps the board will surprise us all in those processes. But finding a new Bruno, replacing his attacking contribution amid the other upheaval, is almost certainly beyond them.",
      "Real Betis are honest about their contradictions as the pioneers behind Forever Green, but that and the enlistment of an Arsenal cult hero is why it works.",
      "Man Utd are ‘growing increasingly confident’ that they will sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton over the summer as Bruno Fernandes’ transfer plan is revealed.",
      "Gareth Southgate has aimed both a ‘sly dig’ at Manchester United and a ‘nod’ to Sir Jim Ratcliffe over his availability and willingness to work with him.",
      "Many assistant managers work in the shadows – Newcastle’s being the obvious exception – so this week’s Famous Friday Quiz will stretch you…",
      "Roy Keane having a pop at Michael Carrick’s wife only exposed his ‘bitterness’ and laziness, with fellow failed manager Gary Neville just ‘nodding along’.",

      "A new report has explained why Manchester United are ‘growing increasingly confident’ regarding their chances of signing Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd made an audacious attempt to sign Baleba from Brighton, but they were priced out of a move for the young centre-midfielder.",
      "Baleba has established himself as one of the best young midfielders in Europe over the past couple of seasons and he has been mooted as a potential long-term replacement for Casemiro.",
      "However, after Man Utd spent around £230m on signings and failed to offload Bruno Fernandes, they had little funds remaining to invest on a new midfielder and they certainly could not afford a deal for Baleba, which would have cost around £100m.",
      "Therefore, Man Utd have kicked their midfield issues down the road until this year and a significant overhaul is expected in this department in the coming months.",
      "READ: Man Utd boss Carrick handed ‘£20m transfer boost’ after dramatic ‘DAWN RAID’",
      "Recent reports have indicated that Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and/or Bruno Fernandes could leave, while Baleba remains ont the radar with several other targets, including Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "Regarding Baleba, a new report from The Sun claims the Red Devils are ‘growing increasingly confident of securing him’ this year as they ‘plan to resurrect’ their midfield.",
      "The report claims: ‘According to well-placed sources, United are becoming more optimistic about prising Baleba away from the Amex in the summer.",
      "‘The 22-year-old central midfielder is tied to Brighton until 2028 but his stock has dropped since United’s interest surfaced last year.’",
      "They claim that the Red Devils have ‘made a January transfer decision’ as ‘they are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick’s appointment as head coach’.",
      "Regarding the two reasons for this stance, the report explains: ‘Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions. It’s understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window.",
      "‘United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.’",
      "Man Utd are ‘growing increasingly confident’ that they will sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton over the summer as Bruno Fernandes’ transfer plan is revealed.",
      "Would ‘main target’ Luis Enrique say yes to Manchester United? Probably not, but this could be the XI he would pick if he did replace Michael Carrick…",
      "After Antoine Semenyo, Manchester City’s latest ‘hijack’ on Manchester United leaves INEOS with the lesser of two £100m signings…",
      "Oliver Glasner is the ‘top candidate’ to be Manchester United’s next permanent head coach, with this the XI we think he would select if he’s appointed…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could still offload Manuel Ugarte this month, while they have been ‘set a price’ for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Man Utd could face competition from Liverpool as they look to bring Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to Old Trafford, according to reports."

      "United‘s dire decline under Amorim and the head coach’s fractured relationship with club chiefs made his position untenable, with the Premier League giants opting to appoint an interim before bringing in a new permanent manager in the summer.",
      "More tempting candidates will be available in the summer due to expiring contracts and the upcoming World Cup, but Man Utd cannot afford to get this appointment wrong.",
      "The Red Devils also cannot fall into the trap of keeping Carrick beyond this season if he does well. Neville does not think this can be given “any consideration”.",

      "“But there cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond the end of this season, for the sake of Michael and the club, even if he wins every single game.”",
      "Neville went on to name four “standout” contenders to replace Carrick, explaining why these bosses need to tick six boxes.",
      "“Manchester United have tried everything when it comes to appointing a manager, absolutely everything,” Neville added.",
      "“They just have to try to remove risks now. Who can handle the media? Who can sort the dressing room out? Who can handle the owners? Who plays a style of football that fans will at least enjoy watching? Who has Champions League experience? Who has big‑game experience?",
      "“The three that standout are Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino. They could all be available after the World Cup. Eddie Howe – who has won a trophy, finished in the top four, and managed a big club in Newcastle – is another.",
      "“To make United an attractive club for players, Tuchel and Ancelotti bring a seriousness to matters. If you appoint a younger manager, United will miss out on players.",
      "“United are going to miss out on a lot of players anyway, but someone like Ancelotti would encourage players to come. They need that right now, because I’m not sure players are queuing up to join unless there is someone to believe in.”"

      "Roy Keane has ripped into Manchester United over their new coaching setup as the legendary captain engaged in a tense discussion with Gary Neville.",
      "Michael Carrick will lead United on an interim basis for the rest of the season having replaced Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford and has chosen former England assistant Steve Holland, Carrick’s ex-Middlesbrough No 2 Jonathan Woodgate, retired defender Jonny Evans and Under-21s boss Travis Binnion to join him on his staff.",
      "Keane is far from impressed by the quartet chosen by Carrick to aid him at United, rejecting the suggestion that Holland’s experience makes him some kind of “guru” and questioning how Jonny Evans has been handed such a significant role having left his post as loans and pathways manager at United in December.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast, Neville said: “Steve Holland, I’m not saying it’s going to bring success, but he is a serious operator. I think it’s made Carrick’s staff better.",
      "Keane was quick to follow up, asking: “What about the other coaches he’s brought in?",
      "“The other two look like people he’s sort of relied upon. I don’t know I’ve never seen the other two coach,” Neville admitted.",
      "Keane went on: “He’s on the beach two weeks ago Jonny Evans. Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Darren Fletcher gives him a job, strangely enough gives him a job.",
      "“He has two games, Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job, great isn’t it. We should all go to Barbados for a week.",
      "“You’re on about getting your coaching staff in, you’re praising one of them saying he’s experienced and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United’s first team?",
      "“He left the job four weeks ago – loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That’s a big step up isn’t it?”",
      "Neville then tried to clarify his point, adding: “When Michael gets announced I think, “okay he’s going to come under a lot of pressure, needs to make sure his information on the training pitch is s*** hot”. If he’d have just brought in Woodgate and Evans that would have made his job a lot harder I think.",
      "Keane then wanted to drill down on Holland becoming the assistant manager.",
      "He said: “Going back to what I said earlier, with Steve Holland, you think what United need at this moment in time, is it just about coaching then?",
      "Neville replied: “My point is, if Steve Holland is on the training pitch at least you know they’re going to get top class training sessions. I’m not saying they weren’t before because they probably were as well. I don’t know what Evans or Woodgate are like as coaches, don’t know what Carrick is like as a coach.",
      "“My point is he has a lot of experience, are you against the appointment of Steve Holland?”",
      "Keane thought Neville was deliberately ignoring the counter point to his experience argument about Holland but failing to point out the lack of top level coaching in the rest of Carrick’s staff.",
      "“On one hand you’re sitting here going, ‘I’m so happy they brought Steve Holland in’, but they brought another two staff in who you’re dismissing as ‘I’m not really bothered about them,'” he said.",
      "“I wish we were sitting here with you saying he’s brought three staff in and they’re all brilliant, so we think Steve Holland is the man now?”",
      "“I think he’s got a lot of experience, a good coach,” Neville reasoned.",
      "Keane was quick to point out that experience does not guarantee coaching success and gave examples of previous staff members in the post-Ferguson era who did not work out.",
      "“Steve McCLaren was experienced, Mike Phelan was experienced, these are all guys over the last few years,” he added.",

      "Keane: “That doesn’t always work, this idea of bringing in someone from the club.”",
      "Neville: “I’m not saying it’s unusual, Carlo Ancelotti used to do it.”",

      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend and tips Manchester City to win a thrilling Manchester derby.",
      "Pep Guardiola is enjoying playing with his shiny new toy.",
      "Antonie Semenyo has hit the ground running at Manchester City and his anytime goalscorer angle for this Manchester derby at 15/8 with Sky Bet really appeals.",
      "What really stood out in the win at Newcastle was how different Semenyo makes this Manchester City attack look. City have brilliance, control and structure coming out of their ears but what they don't always have is raw, aggressive directness. Semenyo brings that in bucketloads.",
      "Defenders are obsessed with Erling Haaland - that is only going to help Semenyo. It creates pockets of space and Semenyo is clever enough and aggressive enough to exploit them. Whether he's starting wide left, drifting inside from the right or ghosting in around Haaland, he's constantly sniffing danger rather than waiting for it.",
      "And, for whatever reason, space seems to open up for him against Manchester United and he revels in it. Semenyo has scored in his last three appearances against United, including that bonkers 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this season.",
      "Brentford rocking up at Stamford Bridge doesn't feel like a mismatch anymore - in fact, it's becoming a fixture they quietly look forward to. They've lost just once in their last eight visits across west London and that tells you everything about the mentality of this team. There is no fear.",
      "And right now, they are absolutely humming.",
      "Brentford are in the middle of their best unbeaten Premier League run of the season - six games without defeat, winning four of the last five. And since December 14, no Premier League team has picked up more points than the Bees (14). They are 11/10 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "Leeds are a great watch and their games are quite chaotic by design. They play on the edge, get in your face and they ask questions of the opposition, but they also invite pressure. Across their last 18 fixtures their games are averaging 3.5 goals and they've kept just one clean sheet in that period.",
      "Fulham arrive as the perfect dance partner to punt on goals with over 2.5 looking very generous at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "They've scored in their last 12 matches across all competitions, showing a level of attacking consistency that travels well. Marco Silva's side don't need huge dominance to find the net either - they're sharp in transition, clever in the half-spaces and dangerous from wide areas.",
      "Arne Slot's Liverpool are beginning to look like a serious team again.",
      "The big shift has come in their structure in defence. Slot has clearly prioritised control without the ball, giving Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate proper protection in front of them rather than leaving them exposed, which in turn has cut out the silly errors costing them goals.",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have conceded just five goals. That's not smoke and mirrors either. The expected goals against data backs it up nicely at 0.8 per 90, pointing to a side that is limiting high-quality chances rather than relying on last-ditch defending or goalkeeping heroics.",
      "When you combine Liverpool's improved defensive process with Burnley's limited attacking threat, Liverpool to win to nil shapes up as a shrewd play at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Crystal Palace arrive off the back of that damaging FA Cup exit, knocked out in the third round by non-league Macclesfield. The instinctive reaction is to expect a fierce response. But history strongly pushes back against that idea.",
      "Looking at the last 13 Premier League teams dumped out by League One opposition or below at that stage, the next-game record reads poorly: three wins, four draws and six defeats. And even those three wins were by the bare minimum - a single-goal margin. There's no evidence of a bounce-back surge. If anything, the hangover lingers.",
      "Sunderland remain unbeaten at home this season - a run built on energy, structure and a crowd that turns the Stadium of Light into a very uncomfortable place to visit. They look a great price on the draw no bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville are the livewires for West Ham. Stop them, and you largely stop West Ham.",
      "The problem for the visitors is that they're running into a Tottenham side specifically designed to take that weapon away.",
      "One of the defining traits of Thomas Frank's Spurs is how well they manage transition moments. They don't allow games to become stretched, they recover their shape quickly and they suffocate counter-attacks before they ever get going. That's backed up by the numbers.",
      "Across the season, Spurs have conceded the second-fewest fast breaks in the league (11) - and crucially, they haven't conceded a single goal from a fast break.",
      "There's also a very strong angle under Frank in that nine of his 10 wins as Spurs boss have come to nil. When Tottenham win, they don't just win, they shut the door. It's 2/1 with Sky Bet to land again.",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes is quietly becoming a magnet for fouls. Not because he's theatrical, but because of how Arsenal use him. He steps in aggressively during build-up, carries the ball forward into pressure and is constantly involved in physical duels at set pieces. That combination naturally invites contact and referees have been happy to blow the whistle.",
      "The recent numbers underline that trend. Gabriel has been fouled at least once in nine of his last 10 starts, averaging 1.53 fouls drawn per 90. That's a healthy baseline for a centre-back, and it puts the 2+ fouls line well within reach in the right type of game at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Here, he's coming up against Igor Jesus.",
      "The Forest striker is aggressive, raw and still learning when to step in and when to back off. He's committed 22 fouls across his recent matches.",
      "Wolves have quietly become a very difficult team to score against. The standout trend in their recent performances is defensive improvement, and it's backed up by serious underlying numbers.",
      "Across their last six games, only Arsenal can better Wolves' expected goals against process of 0.99 per 90. That's elite territory. Wolves have faced Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United in that spell. So while the sample size is small, the quality of opposition gives those numbers real credibility.",
      "We know Newcastle are a very different proposition away from St James' Park - and it's the attacking drop-off that's most striking. In their last 17 Premier League away games, they've scored more than 1.5 goals just three times.",
      "On average, Newcastle are managing just 1.2 goals per away game in that run, struggling to generate sustained pressure or high-quality chances on their travels. The 6/5 with Sky Bet on them scoring under 1.5 goals again on the road looks a winner in waiting.",
      "David Moyes' record away from home against top-level opposition is horrendous.",
      "Going all the way back to his West Ham days, his record away at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City reads 20 losses from 21 games. It's a brutal return.",
      "Those games tend to follow the same script too: sit deep, limit damage, slow the tempo and hope to stay in the contest for as long as possible. Now, this fixture doesn't technically fall into that bracket - but at what point do we start calling Aston Villa an elite home side?",
      "Villa Park has become a fortress. They've won their last 11 home games, a run that includes statement victories over Arsenal and Manchester City. The intensity, structure and belief Unai Emery has created there is right up there with the very best in the league.",
      "Moyes' away games are rarely chaotic though. Since returning to Everton, just two of his 20 away matches have gone over 3.5 goals, with the average sitting at just 1.8 goals per 90. That's why combining a Villa win and under 3.5 goals makes sense at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth's away games this season are bonkers. They're averaging 4.8 goals per game on the road. Nope, not a typo. Yes, almost five goals per game.",
      "The markets are fully aligned for goals in this one though, which naturally pushes us toward the anytime goalscorer angle.",
      "And who better to target than Kaoru Mitoma? The Japanese winger is starting to look like his old sparky, nightmare-for-defenders self. His movement, bursts in behind and instinct for goal are all back in evidence - as shown by his goal vs Manchester City.",
      "History gives us even more confidence. Mitoma has scored five goals in his last six games against Bournemouth - that bit of a psychological edge over the opposition isn't factored into the prices at 5/2 with Sky Bet.",

      "Gary Neville says Michael Carrick must not be Manchester United manager at the start of next season, and has offered his three-man shortlist he would like installed instead.",
      "Carrick succeeded Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford on Tuesday and has been tasked with leading the club - where he won five Premier League titles as a player - to European qualification before the season ends.",
      "Neville wished his former team‑mate well but warned any new‑manager bounce under Carrick, however transformative, should not be viewed as a long‑term solution.",
      "\"I hope Michael does really well,\" former United captain Neville told the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"We could be sat here at the end of the season with the fans up, with the team fifth in the table and back in the Champions League spots, and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "\"But there cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond the end of this season, for the sake of Michael and the club, even if he wins every single game.\"",
      "Neville accepted the decision to sack Amorim and hand Carrick the reins until the end of the season was ultimately the right one, but could not hide his disappointment at the sense of déjà vu it left.",
      "\"When Amorim was sacked and you started hearing the names Michael, Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], Ruud [van Nistelrooy], it felt a bit sad, like 'we're here again',\" he said.",
      "\"We've been there before with Ole, with Giggsy [Ryan Giggs] when David Moyes was sacked. We've seen this movie before.",
      "\"I don't think there was any other option for the club right now. Most United fans will agree with the decision to get to the end of the season because of the managers who are becoming available.",
      "\"But if they weren't to get the manager in the summer, there will be massive pressure. They must be thinking they're going to get one of the big ones, otherwise they wouldn't have appointed a bridge now.\"",
      "Carrick's return to Old Trafford marks his second spell as interim manager and the 12th managerial change of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",

      "\"The three that stand out are Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino. They could all be available after the World Cup. Eddie Howe - who has won a trophy, finished in the top four, and managed a big club in Newcastle - is another.",
      "\"To make United an attractive club for players, Tuchel and Ancelotti bring a seriousness to matters. If you appoint a younger manager, United will miss out on players.",
      "\"United are going to miss out on a lot of players anyway, but someone like Ancelotti would encourage players to come. They need that right now, because I'm not sure players are queuing up to join unless there is someone to believe in.\"",

      "💥 Semenyo's instant impact at Man City🔴 Attack best form of defence for Carrick📈 Fernandes' return to No 10 role🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Antoine Semenyo has only been a Manchester City player for a week following his £64m arrival from Bournemouth but he has wasted no time in showing just how much he has to offer his new side.",
      "After starting on the left flank and scoring with his right foot in his first game against Exeter, he started on the right flank and scored with his left foot in his second against Newcastle.",
      "One goal came from a run in behind, the other from a back-post tap-in. There was even a demonstration of his set-piece threat with his ludicrously ruled-out second goal on Tuesday night.",
      "He has arrived at the Etihad Stadium with a total of 10 goals in 20 Premier League games which puts him behind only Igor Thiago and his new team-mate Erling Haaland this season. The 26-year-old ranks similarly highly for shots and shots on target.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that he will ease the scoring burden on Haaland, who has scored a higher percentage of his side's goals than any other Premier League player this season.",
      "But he has been signed for the variety as well as the volume of his attacking output. His two-footedness has been cited by Pep Guardiola as a major part of his attraction. Semenyo has an almost even split between right and left-footed goals in the Premier League and ranks as one of the most two-footed shooters in Europe.",
      "His versatility is another factor. Semenyo is comfortable on either flank, as he has already shown in City colours, and that's not all. \"He can play as a striker too with his pace,\" said Guardiola.",
      "Semenyo as a No 9 is an intriguing possibility, especially with Guardiola describing Haaland as \"exhausted\" after the Newcastle game. Maybe Omar Marmoush is not his only rotation option. But it is of course on the flanks that Semenyo can bring the most value.",
      "He was mostly used on the left by Bournemouth in the first half of the season but Manchester City already have Jeremy Doku there. Semenyo provides another option but it is worth noting he played more minutes on the right across his time with his former club.",
      "Semenyo's goal against Newcastle, swept home from close range after Bernardo Silva had flicked on Doku's low cross from left to right, was a first glimpse of how the two wingers can combine.",
      "It also typified their different styles as wide players.",
      "While Semenyo is more of a goal threat, shooting roughly twice as frequently as his new team-mate, Doku excels as a provider, creating nearly twice as many chances for team-mates as Semenyo.",
      "The numbers further illustrate how Semenyo gives Guardiola something different and his penchant for the spectacular is another asset. His long-range strike against Spurs in his final Bournemouth appearance was his fourth from outside the box in the Premier League this season. No City player has scored more than two.",
      "He has scored in each of his last three appearances against Manchester United, giving him the chance to become only the fourth player in Premier League history, after Mohamed Salah, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Sergio Aguero, to find the net in four consecutively.",
      "A look back at those previous three goals offers another reminder of the variety of his threat. While one was fired in off the post with ruthless precision following a run in behind, the others were dispatched first-time, with his supposedly weaker foot, having found space to finish in the box, just as he did on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick faces Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career on Saturday but he knows better than most how disorientating a meeting with one of his teams can be.",
      "Carrick was part of the Manchester United sides outplayed by Guardiola's Barcelona in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals. The first, he later revealed, left psychological scars.",
      "Present-day Manchester City are a different proposition to peak Barcelona. Guardiola has adapted his style in recent years. But they have the same capacity to blow teams away.",
      "Opponents tend to err on the side of caution against them. Manchester United did just that when they ground out a goalless draw in last season's Old Trafford meeting under Ruben Amorim. But attack might be the best form of defence for Carrick as he plots his first game as Amorim's successor.",
      "Manchester United have, after all, displayed attacking improvement amid their inconsistency this season. Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals, while only City have a higher 'expected' total. They rank top for shots and shots on target.",
      "Carrick's efforts to build on that attacking improvement will be helped on Saturday by the return of two of his most dangerous offensive players in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo following their involvement at AFCON. It was Amad, of course, who inspired the late victory at the Etihad Stadium last season.",
      "In support of an improving Benjamin Sesko, who has scored three goals in his last two games, they should be confident of causing problems for what is likely to be a makeshift City backline.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne impressed in helping Guardiola's side keep out Newcastle on Tuesday but they are 21 and 20 respectively and only have 11 Premier League starts between them. Carrick should make it his mission to test them at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United's back three is no more. Amorim's exit may also signal the end of Bruno Fernandes playing in a midfield two. He returned to the No 10 role in Darren Fletcher's two games in charge and will surely continue there under Carrick, who used a 4-2-3-1 formation in 112 of his 124 league games in charge of Middlesbrough.",
      "Fernandes' heat maps show an increase in activity in his own half in the last two seasons, illustrating how his role changed under Amorim. It is to the 31-year-old's credit that, despite being asked to play deeper, crowbarred into a system that did not suit him, he continued to carry the same influence in the final third.",
      "This season, he ranks either top or second among Premier League players in a host of creative metrics. His total of 56 chances created is the highest by any player not just in the Premier League but in any of the major European leagues.",
      "Not bad for a guy playing out of position.",
      "Now what can he do back at No 10?",
      "Join David Jones and Jamie Carragher for Brighton vs Bournemouth on Monday Night Football from 7pm, kick-off 8pm.",
      "The last column looked at the significance of Martin Odegaard's return to form for Arsenal and the qualities that make him unique.",

      "Thursday 15 January 2026 17:31, UK",
      "\"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "That's the sentiment that a number of Manchester United fans and even members of Mainoo's own family haven't been shy in making known over the past year. Under Ruben Amorim, it's fair to say the 20-year-old's early career and momentum hit a major bump in the road.",
      "The midfielder - who Gary Neville once said had \"the world at his feet\" after his maiden games - played a key role for England as the Three Lions reached the Euros final in 2024.",
      "Now, still yet to make a Premier League start this season but still harbouring hopes of making a sensational return to the national team fold, Mainoo has Michael Carrick to learn from.",
      "United's new interim head coach patrolled the midfield to great distinction in his playing days. Now, with the middle of the park a lingering concern at Old Trafford, one of his many tasks will be freeing Mainoo.",
      "\"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick said in the summer on Rio Meets, asked about Mainoo.",
      "\"He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom. I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and create and take the ball. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get.",
      "\"He's got it and he's shown that. It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",
      "Asked a direct question whether he'd build the current United team around him, Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to.",
      "\"United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",
      "\"To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that, you can say they get it, they know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",
      "The same thoughts were echoed by Carrick, who told Rio Ferdinand that a \"good midfielder can play in different ways\". Mainoo has been the subject of an experiment to test that theory since he broke through.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, the then 18-year-old was handed his first start at the foot of United's midfield at Everton, impressing alongside Scott McTominay. A flash in the pan turned to a crash in the box as his first season as being involved in the first game culminated in a winning goal in the FA Cup final, again, as part of a midfield two - this time partnering Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "For England, Mainoo would go on to fill a similar role as a No 8 alongside Declan Rice at the Euros, starting every game from the last group stage onwards.",
      "Amorim's eventual arrival at Man Utd plunged Mainoo's role into doubt. Initially used as part of a two, sat ahead of Amorim's infamous back three, Mainoo would go on to be deployed as a No 10 and as a false No 9 at times throughout the course of the season.",
      "In this campaign, Amorim made it clear that Mainoo would be challenging for a spot in the team against an immovable Bruno Fernandes. The United captain, up until his injury in December, had started every game this season bar United's Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "However, his injury didn't provide an opportunity for Mainoo as he too picked up a knock that ruled him out until Fernandes' return. The 3-4-2-1 didn't suit Mainoo but in a return to a flatter back four upon his return to the team under Darren Fletcher, he showed some promise.",
      "The 4-2-3-1 was Carrick's most-used formation during his time at Middlesbrough, with the former Man Utd midfielder setting up that way in 90% of his matches in charge at the Riverside.",
      "Mainoo could emerge as one of the key beneficiaries of Carrick's 17 games in charge at his old stomping ground. Maybe then, we might see a change in matchday attire for any members of the Mainoo family concerned about his lack of 'freedom'.",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:40, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as Premier League clubs try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal are most effective side, Liverpool least, but what are they doing differently? And where does every team rank?",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright and David Fraser",
      "Friday 16 January 2026 09:38, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "Leeds appear an anomaly given they rank joint-third for set-piece goals despite having taken an even higher percentage of outswinging corners than Liverpool, but it is worth noting their last four corner goals have in fact come from inswinging deliveries.",
      "Spurs are another side enjoying success with inswingers. They have an even higher proportion of inswinging deliveries than Arsenal at 83 per cent and rank as the only side with a better corner conversion rate than the Gunners, as per the graphic below.",
      "By using inswingers, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win at Chelsea, when Ben White headed the opener from an inswinging Declan Rice delivery.",
      "The most recent Premier League example came from the other side, when Bukayo Saka's centre was bundled over the line by Gabriel from a few yards out during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "There is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",

      "By Rob Dorsett & Danyal Khan",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:27, UK",
      "Manchester United have gone with Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season, as Rob Dorsett and Danyal Khan break down why the club's hierarchy and Jason Wilcox landed on the appointment...",
      "When Ruben Amorim was sacked last week, people close to him told us the Portuguese coach had been surprised - and struggled - with the sheer volume of noise in and around Old Trafford. Amorim confided in his friends to say how impossible it was to fully prepare or predict what the unique challenges were of being the main man at Manchester United.",
      "United's bosses weren't about to make the same mistake twice.",
      "That is why United's shortlist of candidates for the interim head coach position was made up entirely of United old-boys. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick were to the fore.",
      "The club hierarchy, led by director of football Jason Wilcox, wanted someone who knows the club, who has experienced the pressure and the expectation, who would feel comfortable in a difficult environment where the spotlight is blinding, and where the mood among the fanbase is still filled with frustration, remembering glories past.",
      "Michael Carrick was up front and central in that glorious past. As a player under Sir Alex Ferguson, he won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one Club World Cup. His first taste of coaching was at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho, and he had short stints as caretaker boss, either side of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell in charge. United's bosses are as confident as they can be, that he will not be fazed by the environment he is stepping back into.",
      "It is clear the club's hierarchy didn't want to change head coach mid-season, but with poor results and a total breakdown in the relationship with Amorim, the club was forced to act. Many fans and commentators will ask why United couldn't appoint a new, high-profile manager straight away. But the reality is that Manchester United doesn't have the same pull for the world's elite coaches that it did a decade ago. There is no European football. Budgets are tight. There is still a major restructuring of the entire club taking place.",
      "And so it was sensible for the club to take a pragmatic approach, and save the big decision about the next big boss until the summer, when more big names will be available. Once that decision was made, it was a question of who would be best to run things for the remainder of the season, and give the team maximum chance to achieve European football for 2026/27.",
      "That man, it was decided, was Carrick. And even though he and no one else on the coaching staff has ever worked with Steve Holland before, there was a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable. Importantly, he was also available to start immediately, without the need to pay compensation.",
      "Other key factors in Carrick's appointment were his familiarity with the structure of power at United. Wilcox works closely with the head coach over strategy, philosophy and team selection. Ultimately, it was the significant differences of opinion and Amorim's reluctance to align tactically with Wilcox that saw him get the boot.",
      "Carrick has made it clear he is happy to work within United's existing systems, pointing out that he did so effectively at Middlesbrough, where he worked closely with head of football Kieran Scott. He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.",
      "Sometimes criticised for a lack of adaptability at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick stuck true to his footballing philosophy - one where dominating the football, and opposition, was the primary game plan. That idea, too, aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play.",
      "But what about the other main candidate, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?",
      "The noise from Solskjaer's camp early on was that he was not just interested in the role, he was the favourite. That was noticed inside Carrington with bemusement considering they were clear that no decision would be made until they sat down with the two candidates.",
      "Multiple sources have told us after meeting Carrick face-to-face last Thursday, United's leadership were left impressed. More so than for Solskjaer.",
      "As mentioned, his philosophy and tactical approach undoubtedly made an impact on the likes of Wilcox and Berrada but his willingness to take on the role with no guarantee of a permanent role at the end of the season was also to his advantage during the process.",
      "Solskjaer, it is understood, wanted a permanent option if he performed well in the role - a desire which the United hierarchy were not willing to entertain - clear that role was until the end of the season.",
      "It also has to be considered that a potential return for Solskjaer, who was manager under the previous regime, could be interpreted as a backward step. After consistent messaging around INEOS being forward-thinking, questions would have been asked about returning to a previous manager who did not necessarily succeed during his first spell at the club. Popular with the fan base, yes, but it was a difficult sell and not a good look.",
      "And so Carrick begins his limited reign as United's main man. As things stand, it is unlikely he will be considered for the longer-term role in the summer, alongside the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Marco Silva et al. But the hope is that his appointment will prove to be a positive one for both the coach, and the club which he now heads.",
      "He needs to hit the ground running, but he will be given a little leeway early on - Manchester City at home and Arsenal away - will prove a baptism of fire.",

      "Man Utd have made 10 managerial appointments - six permanent and four interims - since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement, yet none have restored the Old Trafford glory days. As Michael Carrick closes in on return to club, how much do you remember from 13 years turbulent years?",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 17:30, UK",
      "Michael Carrick is on his way back to Old Trafford in an interim capacity, becoming Manchester United's 11th change of manager or head coach since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013.",
      "Carrick previously took the reins after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in 2021 - this time he succeeds Ruben Amorim, who was relieved of his duties on January 5 after just 14 months at the helm.",
      "Amorim was United's sixth permanent appointment of the post‑Fergie era. Each have enjoyed varying degrees of success, but none have managed to restore the glory days synonymous with Ferguson's legendary 26‑year reign.",
      "The intervening 13 years have served up highs - seven trophies won - and a multitude of lows, many of which United fans would rather forget. But the question is: how many do you remember?",

      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup meaning they will only play 40 games this season; with the club out of both domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle and a league title highly unlikely this term - where do the managerless club go this season?",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 07:50, UK",
      "No manager, no trophy hopes, no noise. The final whistle against Brighton was met with a few boos, then stunned silence. Just where do Manchester United go from here?",
      "One statistic flew around United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton. 40 games - that is how long United's season will be. Their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, where there were no cup games due to the First World War.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."
