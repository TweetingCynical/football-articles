      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher believes Manchester United were correctly denied a penalty in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal on Sunday afternoon. Matheus Cunha tumbled inside the box following contact with William Saliba during the closing moments of the Premier League clash.",
      "Having latched onto Matthijs de Ligt's delivery in the area, the summer recruit failed to make proper contact with the ball. Saliba appeared to catch Cunha's left foot, but referee Simon Hooper chose not to punish the defender.",
      "Bothroyd then questioned why, highlighting the prospect of such a challenge being penalised elsewhere on the pitch, asking: \"How's that not a penalty? That's a guaranteed penalty. If that happens on the half-way line, that's a free-kick. Is it a free-kick on the halfway line?\"",
      "Gallagher responded: \"It wasn't on the halfway line. I don't play that game,\" prompting Bothroyd to instantly reply: \"Why not? A free-kick on the halfway line should be the same as in the box.\"",
      "After Gallagher responded: \"I agree on that. No, not a foul,\" Bothroyd snapped back: \"That's definitely a foul. He's come through the back of him. The ball was there, he came through the back of him and hit the foot that he planted. It's a penalty.\"",
      "Despite Bothroyd's insistence, Gallagher ended the discussion by stating: \"You judge what happens and at that point, I don't think it's a foul. I wouldn't give a foul [anywhere else on the pitch].\"",
      "Ex-Premier League official Keith Hackett also agreed with Hooper's original decision. Hackett told Football Insider: \"There is no doubt that the defender made contact with Cunha.",
      "\"The problem here is that the player is already falling down backwards and was searching for a penalty kick. The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error.",
      "\"Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it. Saliba has made a genuine attempt for the ball, and Cunha is already on his way down. He’s not even facing the goal – why? There are lots of questions to be asked here.\"",
      "United travel to Fulham in their next Premier League game on August 31st. The Cottagers drew 1-1 away to Brighton on the weekend, with Rodrigo Muniz cancelling out Matt O'Riley's penalty in the 96th minute for the west Londoners.",

      "Wantaway Manchester United misfit Alejandro Garnacho will not play for Argentina in their upcoming World Cup qualifiers at the start of September.",
      "Garnacho is set to leave United before the transfer window closes, if the Red Devils and Chelsea can come to an agreement over a transfer fee. The Blues are pushing hard to take the young winger to Stamford Bridge, with United ready to cash in if the money is right. It's understood Garnacho has already agreed terms with Chelsea.",
      "The 21-year-old has been training on his own at Carrington for a month and has been frozen out of the squad completely by Ruben Amorim, with his comments and subsequent social media antics following the Europa League Final the last straw for the United head coach. Garnacho had initially fallen foul of Amorim when he was dropped for the Manchester derby last December, before being reintegrated back into the squad - unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in January.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Garnacho was not involved in United's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Now he has been left out of the Argentina squad for the World Cup qualifying fixtures with Venezuela and Ecuador next month. Garnacho, who made his international debut as a teenager in 2023, was a consistent selection by boss Lionel Scaloni in 2024, but has been left on the outside looking in during 2025.",
      "During United's pre-season tour of the United States, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho and himself. He said: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",

      "The drama ignited at Old Trafford on Sunday as United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir flapped at a corner, allowing Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori a simple tap-in to put Mikel Arteta's team a goal to the good. The incident led to former professionals struggling to defend the Turkish goalkeeper, while former referee Mark Clattenburg also claimed the winner shouldn't have stood.",
      "Bayindir called for a foul following the incident due to pressure on him from Arsenal defender William Saliba. However, VAR did not feel the incident needed to be brought to the attention of referee Simon Hooper.",
      "Keys believes Arsenal got away with the goal and claimed Arteta's side often \"push boundaries\" when it comes to set-pieces. He wrote: \"Weak? Maybe a little bit. Soft? Perhaps. Could’ve done better? Of course. That’s always the case. Few leave a field of play satisfied with what they’ve done. But - Bayindir was fouled.",
      "\"We all know what Arsenal do at set-pieces. They push boundaries all the time. Sometimes they get away with it - on other occasions they don’t. They did yesterday (Sunday).",
      "\"Now I’ll explain why Saliba should’ve been penalised. I have no problem with him standing where he did. He’s entitled to do that, but the moment he blocks the keeper by turning his back to him and then backing into him - that’s a foul. Take another look at where Bayindir ends up. He’s in the back of the net with the ball. Saliba sent him there.\"",
      "While the common consensus seems to suggest that Bayindir was fouled, ex-United captain Gary Neville slammed the United goalkeeper. “It’s going to keep hurting United,\" said Neville from the commentary box.",
      "\"The goalkeeper has got to be stronger. I think he will complain that he was fouled. He’s got a player in front of him, there’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on. I just think your goalkeeper has to be stronger.",
      "\"Get that player out of the way. It’s Saliba. He’s not got his arms up, I don’t think he’s done anything wrong at all. Bayındır if anything has his arm on him. He just parries it, it goes through his hands. It’s definitely a goal. He’s just not strong enough.”",
      "Bayindir was given the nod in goal as Andre Onana missed out on Amorim's squad at Old Trafford. Defending his goalkeeper, United boss Ruben Amorim insisted Arsenal’s winner should have been disallowed.",
      "“I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal,\" he said.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes added: “Altay was saying in the moment he goes to push the ball, he gets a touch. But we know in the Premier League they don’t give much in these type of situations, even if they had a meeting with us saying that if the players are blocking and not looking at the ball, they will whistle more.”",

      "Mikel Arteta still wants to strengthen his left wing options - but must sell before he can do more transfer business. That leaves Arsenal facing the prospect of not making any more big money moves in this window unless they start to ship players out.",
      "The Gunners have already been linked with Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo while Arteta is a huge fan of Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze but both will not move to the Emirates unless there is a big last minute shift. Tottenham are now in pole position to land Eze with negotiations ongoing as they look to seal a £60m deal - £55m plus £5m in add-ons - but Palace are determined to stand firm and drive a good deal.",
      "That is currently out of Arsenal’s reach because they have a bloated squad with all their new £200m-plus worth of arrivals but they have so far struggled to get players out of the door with the spotlight on sporting director Andrea Berta to balance the books. Leandro Trossard is most likely to go at this stage as Brentford, Aston Villa and several foreign clubs have shown interest in the versatile forward who is now further down the pecking order. First team squad members Jakub Kiwior, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson did not even make the bench at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "Teenager Max Dowman, 15, was at the game but was left out of the match day squad while Christian Norgaard had a small knock and Gabriel Jesus is recovering from a long term knee injury.",
      "Fenerbahce have shown an interest in Zinchenko who only has a year left on his contract while Porto and Stuttgart are interested in Vieira with the Gunners keen to do a permanent deal. Lokonga has also attracted interest while Kiwior is considering his options after falling down the pecking order despite an impressive finish to last season.",
      "Arsenal signed Noni Madueke from Chelsea for £52m but Gabriel Martinelli started the season at Old Trafford and there is a feeling that they would still like to bring in extra quality. But the interest in Eze did not progress because that would also block off the pathway for Ethan Nwaneri and Dowman getting first team opportunities.",
      "They must offload to do more deals in this window but if another move is to be done then a left winger would be the most likely.",

      "Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho remains among the players expected to leave Old Trafford this summer. However, offloading the winger is proving tougher than expected, though, with Sancho understood to have rejected a pair of potential exits.",
      "Sancho remains among United's highest earners, and is reluctant to take a big hit on his wages. Frustratingly for United, the clubs most interested in a move are not high on the winger's own list of preferences. Roma and Besiktas are the clubs to express an interest. The latter are managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought Sancho to Old Trafford back in 2021 but got the sack a few short months after that.",
      "According to reports on the continent, Sancho doesn't want to move to the Turkish Super Lig at this stage of his career. He is also believed to ave told Roma he doesn't want to join them in this window. Part of the issue with Roma, it has been claimed, is the club's reluctance to match Sancho's £250,00 wages. However, he is also said to be unconvinced by the prospect of a move to Italy.",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea, who had an obligation to sign the winger if they finished high enough in the league. They were able to pay United £5m to escape that obligation, though, and the former Borussia Dortmund star is now back at Old Trafford.",
      "He was left out of the matchday squad for the Premier League opener at Arsenal and has not been assigned a squad number for the 2025-26 season. The number 25 shirt, which he wore for his last United appearance in the 2024 Community Shield, now belongs to Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Sancho isn't the only United fringe player being linked with a move away. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia have also been sidelined by head coach Ruben Amorim, while Rasmus Hojlund was left out on Sunday despite featuring in pre-season.",
      "\"It is our player - we have to make choices,\" Amorim said when asked about Hojlund. \"We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside.\"",
      "AC Milan looks like the most likely destination for the Dane, who is no longer first choice after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko. \"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" Milan sporting director Igli Tare told SportMediaset over the weekend.",

      "Donnarumma played a starring role for Les Parisiens as they won the Champions League last season, but after the arrival of French international Lucas Chevalier, his days in Paris seem numbered. Both the red and sky blue halves of Manchester are now supposedly interested.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are in need of a quality shot-stopper, with Altay Bayindir's flaws exposed in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal and Andre Onana making multiple mistakes last term. City, on the other hand, seemed to have found their No.1 for the future this summer in the form of James Trafford.",
      "But with Ederson set to leave, having been linked with Turkish side Galatasaray, Pep Guardiola remains interested in bringing in the 26-year-old Italian. Where Donnarumma will end up is unknown, but he has been involved in controversial transfer negotiations before, namely in 2017 when he re-signed with boyhood AC Milan, and rumours of a clause involving his brother arose.",
      "In 2017, a still-teenage Donnarumma had become AC Milan's starting goalkeeper and was considered one of the most promising shot-stoppers in Europe. With his contract up, he seemed destined to go elsewhere, with the likes of Juventus and Real Madrid waiting in the wings, but a drastic U-turn occurred.",
      "Although the player's agent, the late Mino Raiola, declared he would not re-sign at the San Siro, Donnarumma put pen to paper on a new deal until 2021, with some alleged interesting clauses insisted upon.",
      "It was reported at the time that as part of this new deal, Donnarumma's brother, Antonio, 27, who was also a goalkeeper playing for Asteras Tripolis, would have to be signed by I Rossoneri. This £1m transfer was completed just one day after the younger brother had penned his new contract.",
      "Antonio was paid roughly £850,000 annually, six times less than his younger sibling. However, AC Milan's sporting director, Massimiliano Mirabelli, made headlines for rubbishing the existence of any clause in Donnarumma's new contract.",
      "\"The first thing we had to do was to renew Gigio's contract, but I immediately had the idea of bringing in his brother Antonio too,\" he admitted in 2017.",
      "\"The technical evaluation comes first and I think Antonio can be a 12th man for Milan. He is not a postage parcel like someone said. I'm sorry for him if certain things have been written.",
      "\"Vincenzo Montella [former AC Milan manager] also endorsed this signing. I know him well and I wanted to bring the family back together. I'm proud to present the Donnarumma pair.\"",

      "The Premier League returned at the weekend – and with it so did the VAR controversy. Six teams picked up maximum points on the opening day, including Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal, who narrowly overcame Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "But it was the video assistant referee that has dominated the headlines once again, with a number of contentious decisions sparking debate online. Arguably the biggest talking point came during Chelsea's opener against Crystal Palace, which saw Eberechi Eze's free-kick ruled out for contravening one of the little-known rules of the game.",
      "One of the most talked-about decisions saw Eze's stunning free-kick ruled out by VAR. Eze struck a venomous effort from outside the box that was too powerful for Robert Sanchez and appeared to have given Palace a shock lead at Stamford Bridge early in the first-half.",
      "However, the celebrations were quickly halted as the goal was checked. The goal was subsequently ruled out to the incredulity of the Palace fans, with one of their players deemed to have stood too close to the Chelsea wall.",
      "Referee Darren England announced to the crowd: \"After review, away number six [Marc Guehi] is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.\"",
      "Guehi was deemed to have been encroaching on Chelsea's free-kick wall - Moises Caicedo in particular - as per law 13 of the International Football Association Board. This law states: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1m (1 yard) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\"",
      "The match between finished 0-0, and viewers were quick to jump on social media to share their disdain at the early decision. One wrote: \"Just to be clear, that Eze freekick shouldn't have been ruled out. I would have lost my mind if we had a goal chopped off for that.\"",
      "Another said: \"If we had scored a freekick like Eze’s today and it was ruled out for the same reason my head would be on mars,\" and a third added: \"Palace were well and truly robbed earlier that Eze freekick should've stood.\"",
      "However, despite the uproar, according to the laws of the game the correct decision was made by VAR.",
      "In the first game of the new campaign on Friday night, reigning champions Liverpool took on Bournemouth at Anfield. Early in the first half, Cherries defender Marcos Senesi appeared to have handled the ball near the halfway line, after initially attempting to control it with his thigh.",
      "Without this intervention, Liverpool striker Hugo Ekitike looked to be away through on goal unchallenged, leading to a barrage of comments online criticising what seemed to be a huge miss from VAR.",
      "One wrote: \"PGMOL an absolute laughing stock just 13 minutes into the new Premier League season as a blatant handball and red card ignored by VAR, despite the whole world watching Bournemouth’s Senesi deliberately deny Ekitike and Liverpool a chance to score.\"",
      "Another said: \"That was a clear handball by Senesi,\" while a third noted: \"How did senesi not get booked for that handball tho?\"",
      "However, the decision was checked by VAR at the time, and the Premier League Match Centre X account cleared up the confusion for social media users via a tweet posted minutes after the incident. It read: \"The referee’s call of no red card to Senesi was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed not to be a clear handball offence nor denial of a goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO), due to the distance from goal.\"",
      "In the same game, the Cherries were denied a chance to equalise on the stroke of half-time with the scoreline still a 1-0. When a ball was floated into the box towards Senesi, he headed it back across the area into the path of an onrushing Alex Scott.",
      "However, Alexis Mac Allister challenged for the ball and the pair ended up in a heap on the ground, with Bournemouth fans screaming for a spot kick. It is unclear whether the alleged foul was checked by VAR, but supporters were up in arms about the moment on social media immediately.",
      "Alongside a clip of the incident, one wrote: \"Penalty against Liverpool in the first half? Didn’t get a replay or even a mention of it at half time…\" Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett also believed Bournemouth should have been awarded a penalty.",
      "He said: \"Bournemouth had a real strong shout for a penalty kick when Alexis Mac Allister came in and clattered Alex Scott. It was a careless challenge, and as such, it is a foul. This should have resulted in a penalty kick to Bournemouth.\"",
      "However, nothing was given and Liverpool went on to win the game 4-2, despite a spirited Bournemouth fightback.",
      "In Aston Villa's goalless draw with Newcastle, Ezri Konsa left his team with 10 men for a good majority of the second half due to his foul denying an \"obvious goal scoring opportunity\". In the 66th minute of the game, a ball was clipped into makeshift striker Anthony Gordon, who was through on goal.",
      "However, Konsa pulled the England international back just beyond the halfway line, and received a red card for his troubles by referee Craig Pawson - which was then checked by VAR and confirmed.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre updated viewers on the decision, as they wrote: \"The referee’s call of red card to Konsa for the denial of an obvious goal scoring opportunity (DOGSO) was checked and confirmed by VAR.\"",
      "Fans were less irritated by this decision, with many agreeing that the referee and his video assistant on the sidelines had made the correct decision. One wrote: \"Hard to argue against the earlier Aston Villa red card.\"",
      "But despite having a man advantage for the best part of half an hour at Villa Park, the Magpies failed to capitalise and the two sides played out a 0-0 draw.",
      "Some Manchester United fans felt hard done by after their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal following an incident involving William Salbia and Matheus Cunha right at the death. In the final minute of normal time, the ball was crossed into the Portuguese midfielder when Saliba appeared to go through the back of Matheus, with footage showing the Frenchman's left foot connecting with his opponent's.",
      "Cunha went down but United's appeals for a penalty were waved away by Simon Hooper who allowed play to continue, before VAR concluded that it did not warrant a penalty.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres provided something to “build on” despite drawing a blank on his full Arsenal debut. Arsenal star Bukayo Saka insists that £64m striker Gyokores has got all the hallmarks of a top quality centre forward and is already settling into his new surroundings.",
      "Gyokores, 27, did not get a single shot on target and was substituted after making his first Arsenal start in the Premier League at Manchester United.",
      "It left many fans wondering about his match sharpness and fitness and the Sweden international has only managed two weeks of full training after his protracted switch from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Gyokores represents a big gamble for the Gunners as he was prolific at Sporting but has yet to prove himself in a top league and he is now in the spotlight at Arsenal.",
      "But Saka is convinced about his new team mate’s qualities and says Gyokores will be ready for the physical challenges of the Premier League. England winger Saka said: “I was impressed with him and he battled for us. It was tough. There was a big battle up there. I thought he did well.",
      "“His performance gives us something to build on and I am sure it will help him next week. He has slotted in well and so have the other guys.”",
      "Arsenal went on a big summer spending spree as they splashed out huge money on Gyokores, bought Martin Zubimendi for £51m and Noni Madueke for £52m.",
      "They also brought in Cristhian Mosquera, Christian Norgaard - who missed the United trip with a small knock - and reserve keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to strengthen their squad and suddenly their bench looks very strong.",
      "But it now remains to be seen whether they have enough X factor in their ranks to push Liverpool and Manchester City in the title race.",
      "The victory at Old Trafford was something of a statement and winning at United - without playing anywhere near their best - is a reason to be optimistic.",
      "Saka was searingly honest about Arsenal’s failings and knows they will have to improve against Leeds on Saturday and their next away trip is to Liverpool.",
      "Saka added: “It was not a great performance. We are happy with the three points, to come away from Old Trafford with a win. We were not up to our usual standards, the basics, sloppy giveaways. Our decision making was not great and that cost us and gave United a lot of momentum. We did not get punished for it but we cannot do it every game.”",

    "date": null,
    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "The first Premier League weekend of the season has been ticked off - almost. The 2025-26 season got underway over the weekend, and there have been thrills and spills already.",
      "Defending champions Liverpool kicked off the season in style with a 4-2 win against Bournemouth at Anfield thanks to two late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. Aston Villa and Newcastle battled to the first 0-0 of the season, while Brighton were held by Fulham.",
      "Tottenham and Manchester City opened the season with comprehensive victories against Burnley and Wolves respectively. Newly-promoted Sunderland also got off to the perfect start with a dominant win against West Ham.",
      "Controversy reigned at Stamford Bridge as Crystal Palace earned a point against Chelsea. Meanwhile, Manchester United's woes have continued with defeat against Arsenal.",
      "When Manchester City signed former AC Milan midfielder Tijjani Reijnders for £46.5m, it looked like a good deal for a player who had scored 15 goals last season and was entering his peak years.",
      "That fee however now looks to be a real bargain following one of the best Premier League debuts of recent years. The Dutchman put in a real virtuoso performance in City’s 4-0 trouncing of Wolves at Molineux. He covered basically every blade of grass, showed excellent creativity and composure. And he even had the finish to open his goalscoring account for his new club with a well-taken strike.",
      "It’s not often you see a new signing take to a brand new league with such little effort but to come away with a goal and an assist represents an excellent return for Reijnders.",
      "So often last season City lacked a real midfield presence due to Rodri’s knee injury but Reijnders appears to be just the man to replace him at the Etihad. If he can keep up those levels, then there is no reason why he can’t be a key cog in another relentless trophy-winning machine under Pep Guardiola.",
      "It is hardly the biggest headline from the weekend, but it could mark a significant improvement. On Saturday, Martin Dubravka became the first victim of a new Premier League rule. Burnley were just three minutes and 13 seconds into their top-flight campaign when Dubravka got his hands on the ball against Tottenham, before quickly losing it again.",
      "Burnley's new goalkeeper held onto the ball for longer than eight seconds and therefore conceded a corner. The rule is designed to limit time wasting, which has become a scourge of elite football. Unlike many other changes to the game, this appears like a simple and easily applied one, which hopefully will have a positive impact.",
      "Unfortunately, it can't stop the more conventional method of time wasting, which serial perpetrator David Raya demonstrated against Manchester United the following day. The Arsenal goalkeeper took an age over every goal kick or free-kick and was finally booked late on at Old Trafford. Time wasting will no doubt continue in those situations and from throw-ins, but one avenue has at least been shut down.",
      "Going into the new season, some worried whether Pep Guardiola’s motivation was waning and a few even speculated he might not have long left as Manchester City manager. Now, though, it looks as though all he heeded was some shiny new toys to play with.",
      "Some ruthless finishing sent City top with a 4-0 win at Wolves, with two of those summer signings on target. Tijjani Reijnders stole the show, but Rayan Cherki’s cameo showcased a level of creativity that could really come in handy against tougher-to-break-down opponents.",
      "Not only that, but Oscar Bobb has made an early case for the ‘like a new signing’ badge after missing the bulk of last season through injury - with Rodri still to return.",
      "Yes, it’s worth recognising that City won their first four games last season before Rodri’s injury. But winning in this manner while still waiting for the Spaniard to take his place in the side will surely worry their rivals for the title.",
      "We can be guilty of not always realising just how good a foreign player is until they play in the Premier League and it looks as if Tijjani Reijnders might be the latest example.With Kevin De Bruyne no longer part of the furniture at Man City they've bought in the Dutchman, who was an instant hit on his debut during the win at Wolves. He was on the scoresheet, as was Rayan Cherki, who could be another massive hit.",
      "City's recruitment may not have seen them land the household names, but Reijnders could yet prove to be an absolute steal having joined from AC Milan for £42.5m.There's no doubt that those on the blue side of Manchester have gone under the radar, regardless of what the pundits say. Few have tipped them to regain their Premier League crown, but that may suit them as they embark on a new era under Pep Guardiola.",
      "My biggest takeaway from the opening weekend was Granit Xhaka might just be one of the signings of the season. While falling hopelessly headfirst into the trap of making judgements after one game, Sunderland’s incredible summer spending spree - in excess of £150m - gave them the energy to beat West Ham and the belief they can stay up.",
      "At the heart of that is former Arsenal captain Xhaka who now wears the armband at the Stadium of Light and, at 32, is the experienced leader a newly-promoted club needs.",
      "When the deal was first mooted, most fans were a bit surprised. He is swapping Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap but it actually shows ambition and determination.",
      "Sunderland’s was the best win of the weekend in my eyes. We desperately need one - hopefully two - of the newly-promoted clubs to stay up. It’s ridiculous that we keep seeing three up and three straight back down. It’s bad for the league.",
      "But a rocking, loud and raucous Stadium of Light is good for the Premier League. I did tip Sunderland to go down before the season started - but I so hope they prove me wrong.",
      "Plenty of players have come and gone this summer, and big hitters like Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah remain, but if you could guarantee Liverpool supporters that one star would stay fit throughout the season then plenty are going to say Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Redeployed at the base of midfield, the Dutchman started every game last season up until the point that the title was secured, but his red card on the final day against Crystal Palace meant that he was suspended for the opener against Bournemouth on Friday, and it showed.",
      "The Cherries were able to cut through the Liverpool midfield far too easily, and while more alterations and additions are expected in defence and attack in the remainder of the transfer window, getting Gravenberch back into his position as the midfield anchor is imperative for a Liverpool side who shipped 11 goals in six pre-season matches, including two in the Community Shield which Gravenberch missed as his partner gave birth.",
      "Liverpool will face a fiery welcome at Newcastle next Monday, and they're going to need their midfield lynchpin available.",
      "Are Arsenal going to play like this every week? If so then they will struggle to beat the big boys and finally land the title. They were hard to watch at Old Trafford. Yes they were defensively resolute but Roy Keane was right - why didn’t they look to kill off United?",
      "Martin Odegaard still looks off his best and that has to be a worry. So many counter attacks he ruined by making the wrong decision or misplacing a pass. Liverpool certainly looked defensively vulnerable but they were ruthless in attack on Friday night while Manchester City were clinical and calm in walloping Wolves.",
      "Arsenal looked sluggish and sloppy against an improved United but certainly not a title-challenging team from Old Trafford. It’s great to be good at set pieces but, my word, how long do they take over each one?",
      "Arsenal have the attacking talent to be explosive and exciting to watch but last season they were too often boring and drew too many games. If they repeat their Old Trafford performance against better teams than United then they will be doing the same again this season.",
      "So if you're an attacking player you can't be within one metre (or a yard) of a wall which has three or more defending players in it. Who knew? Well it seemed as though Marc Guehi didn't, judging by his reaction to referee Darren England when Eberechi Eze's goal was ruled out for Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "So learning a new law of the game might well be my biggest takeaway from the opening weekend. The challenge for the referees now will be to ensure that the rule is consistently applied, because surely this type of thing has happened before and not been punished?",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bayern Munich have failed with a loan bid to land Christopher Nkunku - which has been rejected by Chelsea as they seek to raise funds for their pursuit of Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Manchester United winger is one of two forwards who are being eyed by the Blues - alongside RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons. And as a result they are not looking to sanction any temporary exits which has seen them reject the German's approach for the Frenchman.",
      "Those at Old Trafford are willing to sanction Garnacho's departure with the Argentine falling out of favour. The player himself is keen on a move away to reignite his career and sees Stamford Bridge as the ideal destination.",
      "However his move is contingent on a transfer merry-go-round that needs Chelsea to raise capital to continue their recruitment. As a result they have told Bayern, who want to bring Nkunku back to the Bundesliga, that they only want a permanent sale, reports The Times.",
      "Bayern remain interested in Nkunku as they need to bolster their attack following the sale Kingsley Coman to Al-Nassr on Friday. But given that they and Chelsea want two different deals, any movement is currently unlikely.",
      "Inter Milan are also thought to be interested in Nkunku, but again they have been told that they would need to pursue a permanent move. Leipzig previously considered an approach, but the player is not interest in a return to his former club given they not qualify for the Champions League this season.",
      "Nkunku has four years remaining on his contract after joining the Blues in the summer of 2023. He made a £52million switch from Leipzig after scoring 58 times in two seasons. At Chelsea though he's scored just 18 times in 62 games.",
      "United remain keen on sell Garnacho and are prepared for an offer from Chelsea. Any sale would be beneficial for those in Manchester as the Argentine, an academy graduate, would represent pure profit, which would aid their PSR figures.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another player they want to offload. He, like Garnacho, appears to have little future at Old Trafford currently but he's turned down a move to Roma. The Italians were willing to pay £17m but the winger is still waiting to review his options having been linked with several clubs.",

      "Nicky Butt believes PSR and a lack of city appeal are the two reasons Newcastle United have fallen short with transfers this summer. The Magpies have endured a chaotic summer while attempting to strengthen their squad for a fresh Premier League campaign.",
      "Top targets like Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro, Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, James Trafford and Benjamin Sesko all chose different destinations despite a wealth of interest. While Newcastle have managed to land the likes of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest in a £55million deal and Malick Thiaw from AC Milan for £34.5m, plenty of supporters will feel let down by missed opportunities.",
      "This is particularly galling given that Newcastle will come up against several of their would-be signings this season when they meet the likes of Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City.",
      "While Eddie Howe has moaned that rigid PSR restrictions are \"controlling\" his team's capacity to compete in the current window, Butt claims that there's an additional element at work which might not go down well with the passionate Toon Army.",
      "Speaking to Chronicle Live via BetMGM, the midfielder, who turned out at St James' Park between 2004 and 2010, said: \"I think PSR will definitely come into play, and I think Eddie's such an experienced man, experienced manager and coach, he wouldn't put things out there that he's going to get thrown back in his face as lies.",
      "\"That'll be definitely a big part of it, but I think the thing with Newcastle is, until you're in the club, and unless you know about it... so I knew about it playing against them in the good old days, I knew what a big club it was, and how passionate the supporters were, and when I was going there I knew all about the football club.",
      "\"But some of the players don't know. They don't know how big a football club it is, don't know it's a one-club city, they don't really understand the dynamics of the demographic up there, and obviously it's not London. It's not one of the so-called shining light cities.",
      "\"Even though it's a city, it's not in that kind of elk. It's tough to get. Manchester had a bit for a long time to try to get players from London to Manchester United, it was tough because it wasn't the glamorous city that it probably is now.",
      "\"I think Newcastle are finding that and it's sad. You have to throw something at these players to make it more attractive, which is, you know, more money for some of the players, they get turned on by that. Obviously they're in Europe, in the Champions League and stuff now, so that helps.\"",
      "Butt also believes that Newcastle will be able to lure players who aren't simply chasing a hefty wage packet, and that the club will be capable of landing stars who genuinely fancy playing for Newcastle out of pure passion for the game. He added: \"But yeah, you have to try and get the right ones that want to be there, and I think the ones you lose anyway, in the long run you're better off losing them.",
      "\"Yes, I understand there's finances being involved, because no one's going to go to work at the building site down there for five hundred quid when they can and go and build this out there for five grand. You've got a family to look after, and you've got the rest of your life, so I get finances coming into play, but you've really got to want to play for a football club.\"",
      "It comes as the Magpies found themselves short of firepower when the fresh Premier League campaign kicked off on Saturday. Anthony Gordon was pressed into service as a makeshift No. 9 against Aston Villa due to Alexander Isak's continuing transfer uncertainty.",
      "While numerous supporters will be content with a point secured following a scoreless stalemate at Villa Park, others will be hoping to see Howe and the club's hierarchy move swiftly regarding bringing in a replacement for the restless Swede, particularly considering Gordon's minimal influence.",
      "Newcastle have reportedly set their sights on Brentford's star striker Yoane Wissa, who has hinted at his willingness to make the move up north. However, insiders at the Bees have made it clear that they won't let him go without securing a fitting replacement.",
      "The Magpies have also been linked with Paris Saint-Germain ace, Goncalo Ramos. However, the forward has pledged his loyalty to the Parc des Princes for the foreseeable future, leaving Newcastle to explore other options.",

      "The Italian giants are also interested in Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic but the clubs have reached a stalemate over the fee and his contract. That is the reason behind their interest in Manchester United misfit Hojlund but Milan still face a battle to convince the Denmark striker to give up on Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim admitted Hojlund was left out for his club’s opener with Arsenal and he must now choose whether to stay and fight for his place or leave.",
      "United are keen to do a deal to help balance the books after a £200m spending spree on a new forward line of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "It would mean taking a huge hit on 22-year-old Hojlund who joined from Atalanta for a staggering £72m in August 2023.",
      "However, Hojlund has struggled badly at Old Trafford and he is surplus to requirements but he may be reluctant to leave with United keen on a permanent deal - they want closer to £35m - but would also entertain a loan.",
      "Vlahovic has been Milan’s No1 target with Juventus ready to offload him but it now remains to been whether that deal could be reignited.",
      "There is a belief that Milan could ultimately prefer Vlahovic but have become frustrated in their attempts - and yet he is still a big option.",

      "Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres got an immediate lesson in the challenges posed by the Premier League after his £64m summer move from Sporting Lisbon. The Swedish striker scored 54 goals in his final season in Portugal, but didn't even register a shot on his top-flight debut for the Gunners.",
      "It brings to an end a streak lasting some 28 months. Gyokeres registered at least one shot in every single one of his league appearances for Sporting, but failed to do so for Arsenal against Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "You have to go back 69 games for the last time Gyokeres failed to register a shot in a league outing. According to BBC Sport, the game in question was Coventry vs Blackburn in the Championship, with the Sky Blues claiming a 1-0 win despite their leading man coming up short.",
      "Gyokeres was celebrating another 1-0 win on Sunday despite his personal struggles. Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game, capitalising on an Altay Bayindir error to nod home at the back post after a Declan Rice corner.",
      "Arsenal's new No.14 scored in pre-season during a win at home to Athletic Club. And, while he was made to wait in the league, manager Mikel Arteta recognised he wasn't the only one to find things tough.",
      "\"We came here away and won which is a big result. We were clearly not at our best,\" Arteta told Match of the Day. \"We attacked the box and we reacted well to unusual mistakes. The team reacted time after time in an incredible way. Very proud of that because that is why we got the opportunity to win the game.",
      "\"We showed a resilience and a will to win. They put you on the ropes here, you will have to have moments when you suffer. To find a way to win at this ground, I'm very happy with the team.\"",
      "Arsenal's next game comes at home to Leeds United, who begin their own campaign against Everton on Monday night. Daniel Farke's side scored a league-leading 95 goals en route to promotion from the Championship last term so Arsenal may need to be at their best defensively once more.",
      "No team conceded fewer than Arsenal in last season's Premier League, with goalkeeper David Raya claiming the golden glove award. Raya needed to be sharp to snuff out a couple of United attacks on Sunday, but pointed to the team effort required.",
      "\"That's the willingness, the fight, the spirit that we have altogether, where things are not going our way and we make mistakes, everybody's sprinting back and trying to help the teammate that's made a mistake to recover the ball and to do the right thing,\" the Spaniard said. \"So we did that and I think we dug deep very, very well, especially the last 10-15 minutes where they threw everything to us and we defended very well, so that's credit to the team.\"",

      "Manchester United were unfortunate to lose to Arsenal because the winning goal should have been disallowed, according to Mark Clattenburg. United began their Premier League season with a 1-0 defeat by the Gunners at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Arsenal’s goal came from their first corner of the game as Riccardo Calafiori headed Declan Rice’s cross over the line after Altay Bayindir failed to punch the ball clear. Bayindir felt he had been impeded by William Saliba, but the goal was allowed to stand.",
      "The goal has seen a continuation of the debate over United’s goalkeepers, with Bayindir standing in for Andre Onana, who missed the game following an injury. Gary Neville felt Bayindir was at fault and needed to be stronger, but ex-Premier League referee Clattenburg had sympathy for the Turkey international.",
      "“In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal's goal,” he told United In Focus. “But when you watch it in slow motion, you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball. PGMOL said they would punish this type of challenge more, but again they failed.”",
      "His words echoed those of Ruben Amorim, who felt aggrieved that the goal was allowed to stand. He said: “I understand we want goals, but when you touch the goalkeeper that way, I think it’s hard. Especially to lose with a goal like this, I think it’s hard. It was a strange goal.",
      "“When you touch the goalkeeper, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and let the ball pass. But again, it's the rules. If it's allowed, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Arsenal have become the masters of scoring from set pieces over the past few seasons and appeared to have identified United’s weakness. Saliba occupied Bayindir, who got a hand to Rice’s cross, but could only divert it into the head of an unmarked Calafiori at the back post.",
      "Neville has urged United to pursue Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is poised to leave Paris Saint-Germain. The ex-United defender believes the big personalities of the two keepers and their ability to cope with pressure would help his old club and Wayne Rooney agrees.",
      "Rooney said on his podcast: \"Donnarumma, I think he's 26, he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world, it would be crazy if Man United don't go for him.\"",
      "However, Amorim insists he is \"happy with the three goalkeepers\" and added: \"I think we prove today that we can win any game in the Premier League, especially against a great team like Arsenal and we were the better team. So I’m happy with the players.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will hinge on whether Ruben Amorim brings in a new goalkeeper before the transfer window shuts. The Red Devils put on a vastly improved performance in their Premier League opener against Arsenal, despite suffering a 1-0 defeat.",
      "The Gunners found the net early in the first half through Riccardo Calafiori, after a blunder from keeper Altay Bayındır gifted the defender a simple finish at the far post. While United registered more attempts - both on and off target - and enjoyed better pass accuracy and completion rates, they failed to capitalise on this dominance for the remainder of the game.",
      "However, supporters will have been encouraged by Amorim's side throughout the first game of the 2025/26 campaign and the progress since the conclusion of last season.",
      "Ex-Newcastle legend Shearer hailed the performance of the Red Devils at the weekend, but issued a warning regarding their problem area between the sticks. Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, the Premier League top scorer praised new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for bringing fresh energy into Old Trafford.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "At present, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton as their choice of shotstopper - yet neither Amorim nor supporters appear convinced by any of their options. Onana was regularly rotated with Bayindir during the previous campaign, with the pair conceding 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Onana failed to make the matchday squad for the opening fixture of the season, with 39-year-old veteran Heaton taking his place on the substitutes' bench instead.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma remains on United's wishlist, following his omission from the squad that travelled to face Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup last week.",
      "His deal in the French capital expires at the end of next season, meaning he could leave without a hefty transfer fee. Given the existing friction between player and club, it appears likely that the goalkeeper will exit Paris this summer for a reduced fee, though United's rivals Manchester City are currently frontrunners for his services.",
      "AC Milan's Mike Maignan is also on the Red Devils' radar as they consider a potential swap deal for young striker Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish forward has found himself out of favour with Amorim and looks set to bid farewell to Manchester this summer.",
      "In a surprising twist, it's been reported that David De Gea could make an unexpected comeback to United following the discovery of a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could see him depart for a cut-price fee.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There has been talk of United going after a new shotstopper this summer and Donnarumma is a man on the market after falling out of favour at PSG. The Italian has just claimed the Champions League with the French side but is now looking to quit the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim currently has Bayindir, Onana and Tom Heaton on his books. The latter is a veteran whilst question marks hang over the other two. Rooney admitted the Cameroon goalkeeper \"certainly didn't fill us with confidence last season\" after making numerous errors.",

      "Arsenal skipper Martin Odegaard gave the perfect response to Tony Adams' recent calls for him to be replaced as club captain. That's after the Norwegian enjoyed a performance fitting of the lead man in Arsenal's hard-fought 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday.",
      "The Gunners travelled to Old Trafford not long after club legend Adams suggested Arsenal are \"not going to win the league with Odegaard as captain.\" The retired defender, who won four league titles with Arsenal and captained the team for 14 years, suggested the midfielder isn't the man to end the club's Premier League drought after three straight runner-up finishes.",
      "Speaking at a recent live recording of the Indo Sport podcast, Adams said: \"I'm seeing Declan Rice as a captain, but I'm saying to Arteta, 'Come on, step up now. It's your time to be a winning manager and a fantastic manager, because you're not going to win the league with Odegaard as captain.'\"",
      "Odegaard has since responded to those comments and given some insight as to how he looks to inspire his squad. However, he saved the most apt reply for Sunday's trip to Old Trafford, where he delivered a leader's display under massive pressure.",
      "The 26-year-old played a crucial role in getting Arsenal out of several scrapes and firing his side upfield in numerous quick transitions. He also made five clearances - only William Saliba (seven) made more among Arsenal players - and did a good job of calming matters when United looked like unnerving their guests.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta has also come to his captain's defence after retaining Odegaard as skipper. He recently revealed the matter was decided by a club-wide vote, and there was a heavy consensus the former Real Madrid man was their pick to lead.",
      "\"My opinion is clear, and it's not just my opinion - it's all the staff and especially the players,\" Arteta told reporters ahead of Arsenal's Premier League opener. \"I asked them to vote [for] the captain, and I got the result yesterday.",
      "\"By a mile away, by a big, big 100 miles, everybody was choosing the same person, Martin Odegaard, which is the most clear sign that you can have. It's how they feel about who has to be their captain to defend, improve and win the matches that we want to win, so there’s no question about that.",
      "\"There is [a vote] every year especially because we change [personnel] a lot, and we change the leadership groups, because a lot of the players that were there are now gone. So we need to re-establish that and because it gives you so much information, how they feel about themselves and how they see [the captain] as a leader. It was really interesting to analyse all the data and to gather information.\"",
      "Sunday's Premier League curtain-raiser is of course just the first step to Odegaard truly proving he's the man to take Arsenal to silverware. But victory away to one of the club's greatest nemeses on the opening weekend of the new season is no bad way to start.",
      "\"There's always these small things you have to do. In general it's just how I see it is to get the best out of the team and how to give the team the right mindset. Help the players around you, get the best mindset in everyone.",
      "\"I think before the game just on the pitch I do a little one (team talk) and inside the dressing room we have different people talking. It's not just me there's a lot of people sharing the responsibility and the manager does a lot as well. It's a shared thing. It's not just me all the time.\"",

      "There are just two weeks to go before the transfer window shuts, and plenty of Premier League clubs may feel they have work to do in the transfer maeket. Among them are reigning champions Liverpool, despite the Reds making a winning start to the season on Friday.",
      "Arne Slot's side have already spent big this summer, breaking the Premier League transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz. Their defensive issues came into focus during the win over Bournemouth, though, and Slot could be tempted to reinforce further.",
      "Last season's runners-up Arsenal looked more solid at the back on Sunday as they pipped Manchester United. It was a tricky afternoon for new striker Viktor Gyokeres, though, and the Gunners may feel they need to give the Swede more support.",
      "United themselves were able to take some positives from their performance if not the result. Questions remain for them, thoughm especially in goal after Altay Bayindir's struggles for Arsenal's winner.",
      "United's need for a new keeper became more acute when Bayindir flapped at a corner to allow Riccardo Calafiori to score Arsenal's winner at Old Trafford. Fellow senior keeper Andre Onana didn't even make the bench, despite head coach Ruben Amorim indicating the Cameroon international wasn't injured, and a new starting keeper could well arrive this month.",
      "Emi Martinez is one option, with the Aston Villa keeper absent through suspension this week, while Gianluigi Donnarumma's future might hinge on how serious rivals Manchester City are about a deal and Inter Milan could beat United to cheaper target Senne Lammens.",
      "Further forward, Amorim is certainly a fan of Carlos Baleba as United seek out defensive midfield reinforcements. Brighton won't let the Cameroonian leave on the cheap, though, so United may need to sell before they can buy.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia are among those who could fetch a fee, with Roma keen on both, but it could be that the pair follow Toby Collyer by leaving on loan rather than permanently. Harry Amass has also been tipped to leave on loan, with Diego Leon's arrival leaving United in better shape down the left.",
      "There are three more out-of-favour players who could leave permanently to potentially bring in funds for a Baleba swoop. Alejandro Garnacho is wanted by Chelsea while Real Betis remain keen on Antony, and AC Milan target Rasmus Hojlund looks closer to an exit after being left out of the squad to face Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Arsenal have been busy already this summer, taking a focused approach under new sporting director Andrea Berta. They're only likely to add one more senior star, if that, but midfield creativity looks to be the order of the day.",
      "The development of Ethan Nwaneri has seen the Gunners cool their interest in Eberechi Eze, with Tottenham now looking the most likely to sign the Crystal Palace star. Arsenal could yet make a last-gasp move for the England international, but the priority right now appears to be cashing in on fringe players to raise some funds - even if they don't end up spending it all right now.",
      "With Gabriel Martinelli starting at Old Trafford and Noni Madueke coming off the bench, Leandro Trossard looks to be the odd man out. There has been well-documented Saudi interest in the Belgian, though he may yet wait for an offer from Europe.",
      "Fabio Vieira, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Reiss Nelson all spent time out on loan last term and all three could yet move for the right price. Vieira has been eyed by Stuttgart, and all that remains is agreement on the price.",
      "Jakub Kiwior and Oleksandr Zinchenko could also leave if the right offer comes in, with Fenerbahce chasing Zinchenko. We could also see a late summer exit for backup goalkeeper Karl Hein, with Tommy Setford promoted from the under-21s into the senior set-up.",
      "You might look at a team spending £300m and think 'surely they're done for the summer'. Liverpool have also brought in a sizeable sum through sales, though, and this - combined with their lack of spending 12 months ago - leaves some wiggle room.",
      "The defending for Antoine Semenyo's goals at Anfield suggests a new centre-back could be crucial. Giovanni Leoni arrived too late to feature in that game, and is still a teenager, so Marc Guehi could yet join from Crystal Palace.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, Alexander Isak remains more likely than not to join Liverpool after Newcastle left him out of their squad to face Aston Villa on Saturday. We're unlikely to see any additional incomings, but Liverpool could still cash in on some fringe players.",
      "Ben Doak was left out entirely on Friday, and is due to complete a permanent move to Bournemouth. Kostas Tsimikas looks the next-most likely to depart after being relegated to third choice left-back, with Nottingham Forest among the interested parties.",
      "Harvey Elliott could also leave for the right price after staying on the bench against Bournemouth, though Federico Chiesa's goalscoring cameo has seen talk of a departure for the Italian start to cool. There could also be some more loan departures after Luca Stephenson's move north of the border, with James McConnell and Lewis Koumas both in demand.",

Former Red Devils star Wes Brown made the observation after the Portuguese boss demonstrated his willingness to make bold decisions since his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "United kicked off their Premier League season with a narrow 1-0 home loss to Arsenal on Sunday. And there were reasons for the hosts to feel encouraged as United created the majority of clear-cut chances despite succumbing to Riccardo Calafiori's early header.",
      "New arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha played the full 90 minutes in their United debuts, while Rasmus Hojlund was omitted from the matchday squad entirely. Altay Bayindir, whose display came under scrutiny from Gary Neville following his role in Calafiori's opener, was given the nod in goal amid ongoing speculation surrounding Andre Onana's future.",
      "Amorim, 40, has demonstrated his readiness to make courageous calls since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November 2024. Sunday's team sheet reinforced Brown's earlier comparison between the current manager and club icon Ferguson.",
      "\"He's signed a few players who can play in different positions, especially those who have done really well in the Premier League. That's a massive thing, something we've missed.\"",
      "Brown, who made his Premier League debut for United in 1998, joined the club's first team during a period of change under Ferguson. The legendary manager had guided the Red Devils to glory with stars like Gary Pallister, Brian McClair, Lee Sharpe and Steve Bruce in the mid-90s, but wasn't afraid to bid farewell when he felt it necessary.",
      "Onana and Hojlund were brought to Old Trafford by Ten Hag in the summer of 2023 for a potential combined fee of around £115million. Both are rumoured to be on their way out of United this summer, although Amorim insisted on Sunday that Onana's absence was due to a lack of training and fitness.",
      "Bayindir's inability to command his area from an early Declan Rice corner once again highlighted the goalkeeping issues at United. Despite struggles in attack, Mbeumo and Cunha showed promise, while new signing Benjamin Sesko could only do so much in his brief 25-minute appearance off the bench.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all left out of United's first squad of the Premier League season. Each of the four is expected to leave the club this summer, further demonstrating Amorim's confidence in his decisions.",
      "Academy graduate and ex-United poster boy Marcus Rashford has been loaned to Barcelona in another big call this summer. January signing Patrick Dorgu also made a strong impression on United's left flank on Sunday, showing Amorim's influence is gradually taking shape at Old Trafford.",
      "The last two weeks of the summer transfer window could bring even more changes, with some marketable players still officially part of the squad. However, Amorim's refusal to include them despite the pressure of the Premier League resuming demonstrates a firm commitment reminiscent of Ferguson himself.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Michael Carrick has explained why Scott McTominay struggled to reach his full potential at Old Trafford. The 28-year-old signed for Napoli last summer, winning Serie A and the league’s Most Valuable Player award in his debut season.",
      "McTominay scored 13 goals and provided six assists in 36 games last term, becoming an instant hero in Naples. This was a far cry from the criticism he faced during his time at the Red Devils, usually when he was part of a midfield pivot alongside Fred, with the duo being labelled ‘McFred’.",
      "There were standout moments during McTominay’s last full season at Old Trafford, scoring 10 goals in all competitions and often finding the net at crucial times for Erik ten Hag’s side. While many fans were surprised by McTominay’s ascendency at Napoli, Carrick, who was United assistant coach under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, admitted that the midfielder’s ability was always evident, even though he was made to play a slightly different position.",
      "“He was always, yeah, we had a bit of a kind of few discussions with it about Scott when we were coaching with Ole and we played a lot with him and Fred and actually had a lot of good success in many ways with the two of them,” Carrick said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. “More defensively, yeah, he could, he was kind of the box-to-box, if you like, done a bit of everything, but more defensive.",
      "“But he was reliable, he was a fantastic attitude, great to work with. But he always had, and in training, he always had an eye for goal. He was a great finisher. Getting in the box, and he had that, I never really had it, but with certain lads, getting around the box is just that extra bit of time to finish.",
      "“Like a [Frank Lampard], you know? I know Lamps was obviously best of the best of that, but he's got a sense of that, getting in the box, and it drops to him, like it's goals, he's just finding that.",
      "“And he always had it, and we tried a couple of times, and just because of the make-up with the team, it didn't quite work at that time, but there was always something in there where you think, he's got goals in him, Scotty.”",
      "“I'm so happy that he's gone to do well, because he deserves it,” Carrick added. “I'm sad that it's not at United, because I think he's kind of the one that you want at the club, because he just drives everything, he's a heart and soul, but to see him go on and do well, it speaks volumes, and there's no one taking that. He's had ups and downs, big ups and downs, and he's gone on, and actually he's not looked back now. It's incredible what he's done.”",
      "The Scotland international rose through United’s academy and became a first team regular under Solskjaer by 2019, going on to win the FA Cup and League Cup as well as reaching the 2021 Europa League final. He made 255 total appearances for his boyhood club and Carrick was asked why McTominay was not trusted in a more attack-minded role until leaving for Napoli.",
      "“Make-up of the team, the dynamics, whatever,” Carrick explained. “Look at England, you know, you've had it with England over the years. Why does it not work with England? Sometimes it's not an individual thing, it's a dynamic, it's the make-up of the group, it's the atmosphere surrounding it, that's what I'm saying.",
      "“It's not always just about that football or that game, there's kind of feelings around it sometimes that affect everyone's judgement, you know, it's not always as straightforward as that.”",
      "While Carrick argues that McTominay occupied a deeper midfield role to help the balance of the team, the player believes he was misunderstood after stepping up to United’s first team. The 28-year-old was willing to play any position asked of him and backed himself to be more consistent than some of the club’s marquee signings, but this selfless attitude arguably prevented him from finding his best position in the United team.",
      "“When I got into the first team, I was quite misprofiled in where I was playing,\" McTominay told The Athletic in April. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there.",
      "\"But I was being used as a number six or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game. But when you're playing for Manchester United and you're 20, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at number eight ahead of Paul Pogba. It's not realistic.\"",
      "\"You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do,\" McTominay added. \"In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.",
      "\"They would always sign someone who wouldn't necessarily be what people expected them to be. My mentality was that I was always there, ready to go, ready to take my opportunity. I always wanted to prove my worth, to show I could play every game. It's not the sort of thing that affects me. You can only be in control of what you do.\"",

      "Manchester United have investigated how hundreds of supporters struggled to enter the stadium before the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "United have been criticised by fans who encountered problems at the turnstiles before the opening day fixture. The club has rolled out a new ticketing system for every supporter for 2025/26, meaning fans now enter Old Trafford using NFC (Near Field Communication) technology.",
      "All tickets are digital on a smartphone and downloaded to a device's wallet. The tickets are scanned to gain entry at the turnstiles, but mass confusion occurred before the Arsenal game when hundreds of supporters could not gain entry, and they were sent to the ticketing office by unprepared stewards.",
      "United have investigated the issue and are planning to provide additional fan-friendly assistance around Old Trafford on matchdays this season to prevent a repeat.",
      "The club introduced NFC tickets under instruction from the Premier League. United phased the introduction of the NFC tickets over the past year to help fans adapt to the change, but it appears some stewards on the turnstiles were unprepared to assist some supporters with the technology.",
      "The MEN has been told United recognises from the feedback that they must do more to make entry as smooth as possible, although the club claim the NFC system itself \"worked well\".",
      "United said flow rates were consistent with previous seasons, with 92 per cent of fans inside before kick-off, and 98 per cent of supporters by 16:35, but the supporters who were forced to endure long delays are not happy.",
      "One fan tweeted: \"Man Utd ticketing is a disgrace. Thousands of fans queuing at the ticketing office because the new NFC tickets are not working at the turnstiles! 10 minutes to kick off and massive queues everywhere.\"",
      "Another fan posted on Facebook: \"Manchester United excelled themselves today. Gave mum a plaque on her seat as she’s had her season ticket for 25 years, but then wouldn’t let her in.",
      "\"Ticket wouldn’t scan despite being downloaded exactly as instructed. And despite another fan helping her to download it again. Man on the turnstile was a useless ‘computer says no’ character and refused to let her in.",
      "\"He told my 77-year-old mum, who struggles walking, that she had to go to the ticket office where there was a queue a mile long. And this was after queuing in the car for over an hour to get to the stadium, which we live five miles from.",
      "\"She went home. I got to the seats only to find two other people sat in them! Not sure how they’d managed to get in, but I had to kick them out and now mum’s Platinum Season Ticket Holder seat is empty. Well done United. Well done. Hope you’re proud.\"",

      "It was nearly 8pm on Sunday and Ruben Amorim was only at the start of his post-match signing session outside the Stretford End tunnel.",
      "Hundreds of Manchester United supporters had waited patiently. They tend to, whatever the result and whatever the weather. Before full-time on the final day of last season, a couple of narky Mancunians asked some innocent fans why they were waiting for the lot that had just finished 15th. United are still 15th.",
      "Amorim was happier after a press conference that clocked in well at a meagre three-and-a-half minutes. He was incredulous that his choice of goalkeeper was questioned and the debrief centred so heavily on the 'keeping situation it was wrapped up quickly.",
      "Perhaps Amorim bristled at the lack of focus on United's performance. That they were better than Arsenal was undeniable and will have been reflected in any sensible piece filed from the press box in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand.",
      "United were good and easy on the eye, which may have accounted for the large phalanx of fans outside. United were a chore to watch for almost the entirety of last season, particularly in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal, once such a sanctimonious club under Arsene Wenger that performances took precedence over results, have flipped it. They are a throwback to the George Graham era and actually revel in defending leads. This was their third 1-0 win at Old Trafford under Mikel Arteta and they have all been gritty performances.",
      "Winning ugly is an essential trait for title winners. United just need to win. Sunday marked their 19th home defeat since the start of the 2023-24 season.",
      "The players and staff still embarked on their dubious full-time lap of honour. There was appreciative applause from those who remained. It was noticeable that hardly any supporters left before the game had concluded.",
      "But the bottom line is United lost with a team littered with contentious calls: the goalkeeper, the left-sided centre back, the defensive midfielder, the right winger and the number seven.",
      "Amorim seemed to settle on a more becoming balance in pre-season, with Amad on the right. He was one of two players to start all five friendlies, which made Amad's demotion to the bench such a strategic shame.",
      "Suddenly, there were seven defensive players - a goalkeeper, three centre halves, two full backs, a defensive midfielder - picked for a home game. If Arsenal were at the races, they would have won at a canter.",
      "Instead, United did almost all of the running. Aside from the winning goal, Arsenal did not create a genuine chance worthy of the Match of the Day highlights until Bukayo Saka latched onto Martin Odegaard's disguised dink in the 92nd minute.",
      "Yet they did not need to. Including the seven minutes of added time, Arsenal defended their slender advantage for 84 minutes against a team that did not start a striker.",
      "United had £182.12million worth of strikers in the stadium: one in the directors' box, one on the bench and one on the pitch for the final 25 minutes. Warming up for Arsenal with strikerless sides against Everton and Fiorentina was a gear-shift from Amorim. He refused to consider that set-up in the run-in last season, despite Rasmus Hojlund's hopelessness in front of goal.",
      "Amorim dropped Hojlund after he strolled into the mixed zone in Chicago and outlined his intention to stay. Hojlund is small-fry for Amorim after he dispensed with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho, but the United head coach has cut off his nose to spite his face. United's strongest performances in pre-season were with the Dane starting up front.",
      "There was still £193.5m worth of attackers in United's front three. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo complemented one another auspiciously and their willingness to get on the ball and put opponents on the back foot is not a sight United fans are accustomed to from attacking debutants.",
      "Antony scored on a victorious debut against Arsenal three years ago. He did little else and looked one-paced and one-dimensional during a self-indulgent hour. Cunha and Mbeumo did not get on the scoresheet but their movement, fluidity and presence in attacks bodes well. Amad offered another dimension when he was summoned early into the second half.",
      "Picking Mason Mount over a more suitable starter backfired in the Europa League final for Amorim and did so again. Mount is intense and competitive but he has not played properly well in the league two years into his United career yet Amorim is still crowbarring him into the team.",
      "It is impressionable of Amorim, too. Mount gained his place against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on the back of his two-goal cameo in the semi-final second leg. Against Everton in Atlanta, he emerged to score United's final goal of their tour and has since returned to the starting XI.",
      "Another blind spot is Altay Bayindir. United needed a new goalie this summer not to outright replace Andre Onana but to offer credible competition. Bayindir was fortunate to play for the club again after he punched thin air from Son Heung-min's corner at Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals eight months ago.",
      "\"Without VAR,\" an impassioned Amorim reminded us. \"With VAR, it's a foul.\" It wasn't.",
      "Then Amorim reminded us Bayindir was \"unbelievable\" in the FA Cup tie at Arsenal last season. He was after the superb game-changing denial of Odegaard from the penalty spot. Before that, he was constantly kicking the ball into touch.",
      "In the press conference room, Amorim eventually said he was \"happy\" with his three goalkeepers. Deep down, he can't be.",
      "Those United fans would also likely wait around outside the Stretford End for a goalkeeper signing.",

      "Manchester United players remain optimistic about their progression under head coach Ruben Amorim, despite starting the new season with a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Dressing room sources say the players believe they made clear strides with their performance against Arsenal, who came second in the Premier League last season and reached the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "A second source said the squad felt the performance was \"much better\" than how United fared in the majority of their home matches last season.",
      "United had 61% of possession and 22 attempts at goal, with seven on target - more than twice as many as Arsenal managed.",
      "Left back Riccardo Calafiori's 13th-minute header decided the contest after a blunder by error-prone back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "The result marked United's 19th defeat at Old Trafford since the start of the 2023-24 season and Amorim has reached 15 defeats faster than any Premier League manager, excluding those in charge of newly-promoted clubs, since Paul Hart in 2009-10.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year,\" Amorim said after the Arsenal match. \"We sprint more, we were more brave, we let one against one all the game. We pressed high.",
      "\"And then with the ball, we have quality. Even when the stadium makes some sounds, we continue to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up, compared to last year, [when] we struggled a lot.",

      "Manchester United did not deserve to lose against Arsenal and it might have been a different story if Altay Bayindir had not started.",
      "Andre Onana has been recovering from a hamstring injury but had three training full sessions under his belt. Onana was omitted from the squad and Amorim decided to start Bayindir in his absence.",
      "Once it was decided Onana was not ready to feature, Bayindir was a guaranteed starter, but a large portion of supporters would have preferred to see Tom Heaton given a chance instead.",
      "In a tense post-Arsenal press conference, Amorim was asked whether he considered starting Heaton and he snapped back: \"Why? He [Bayindir] suffered a goal like this where?",
      "\"Without VAR. With VAR [at Tottenham], is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I'm happy with the three goalkeepers. He [Bayindir] chooses to get the ball, but he's getting pushed. That is my feeling when I see the play.",
      "\"You choose to push a player [out of the way] or to get the ball in that moment. He needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players. He chooses to push players and will let the ball pass.\"",
      "In a way, it was admirable for Amorim to staunchly defend his goalkeeper in a short press conference, although he must privately concede that Bayindir is not good enough and should not be starting games for United.",
      "Bayindir is not aggressive enough at corners and fails to command his area. He made the same mistake against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup in December last season and struggles to claim aerial deliveries.",
      "The Turkish international is meek when set-pieces are taken. And if that wasn't bad enough, he attempted to clear the corner with his left glove, which was the wrong hand to punch the ball with.",
      "From a technical standpoint, it was a shocking mistake from Bayindir and it cost United on the opening day of the Premier League season. Amorim gave Bayindir a second chance after a similar mistake against Spurs, but it's obvious to anyone with eyes that he needs to be replaced as second choice.",
      "Heaton has been underused during his second stint at his boyhood club. He is no spring chicken at 39 years old, but would he have conceded from that corner? It seems unlikely Heaton would have been so passive.",
      "Amorim seemed offended to be asked whether he'd considered Heaton to start against Arsenal, however, most would agree he would be a better option when Onana is unavailable to start.",
      "Bayindir is so unconvincing that he even skewed a simple pass to Bruno Fernandes when United were frantically trying to launch the ball forward in the final seconds of added time.",
      "The good news is that Onana is set to be available to start against Fulham at Craven Cottage this weekend. It says a lot about Bayindir that fans are desperate to see Onana play again when he starts instead.",
      "Amorim must rethink his cup competition policy of giving opportunities to Bayindir because he will continue to cost United this season.",
      "In an ideal world, Bayindir would be offloaded before the transfer deadline and a new goalkeeper would be signed to challenge Onana.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United coverage on Monday, August 18th 2025.",
      "United’s Premier League season got up and running with a narrow defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo started the match while Benjamin Sesko’s debut came as a second-half substitute, but Riccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal took all three points back to London.",
      "United continue to look for new faces to add to Ruben Amorim’s squad, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is liked by the head coach thought to be on the club’s radar.",
      "Interest in Wharton comes after it was reported that a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline, with United relaxed about the situation and happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "There is also the small matter of sales to discuss with Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia all expected to depart before the window closes.",
      "Leeds United picked up a narrow win to conclude the opening Premier League weekend.",
      "We will be back tomorrow with all the latest news, gossip and transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "It'll be bright and early so set your alarms.",

      "Not much to really report as of yet since tagging in for Isaac.",
      "It's goalless at Elland Road between Leeds and Everton.",
      "David Moyes' side have struggled to deal with the hosts but the encounter is approaching the interval with both sides level.",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are reportedly set to go head-to-head in the transfer market for PSG's unsettled goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The Italian has already made it clear he intends to leave the French capital this summer after being frozen out. Donnarumma was a standout performer for Les Parisiens during their Champions League triumph last season, yet the signing of French international Lucas Chevalier has seemingly pushed him towards the exit.",
      "Now, both the red and blue sides of Manchester are believed to be circling. Ruben Amorim's squad urgently need a dependable presence between the posts, with Altay Bayindir's shortcomings highlighted in their narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal, and Andre Onana guilty of repeated errors throughout the previous campaign.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United's new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo gave plenty of reasons for United fans to be positive about this season, despite Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal.",
      "That is the verdict of former Liverpool midfielder and BBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy who felt the pair gave United an extra physical edge at Old Trafford compared to last season.",
      "United signed Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves, while Mbeumo arrived in a deal that could reach £71million from Brentford.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho will not play for Argentina in their upcoming World Cup qualifiers.",

It continued a worrying trend for the Turkish shot-stopper who made several mistakes last season under Ruben Amorim - the nadir being in United's heavy 4-1 loss at Newcastle, where he made several blunders.",
      "Bayindir started against the Gunners with United's regular No.1 Andre Onana having only recently recovered from a hamstring injury after missing the entirety of the Reds' pre-season schedule. Onana also made several errors last season although Amorim insisted after Sunday's game that the Cameroonian had not been dropped against Mikel Arteta's team.",

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund has been linked with a surprise switch to Fulham.",
      "The arrival of Benjamin Sesko at Old Trafford from RB Leipzig this summer has seen Hojlund fall out of favour at United. The Danish international was an unused substitute for United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina and was left out of their squad entirely for Sunday's season opener at home to Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund arrived in August 2023 but has struggled to become the consistent goalscorer Ruben Amorim and his predecessor Erik ten Hag have badly needed. The former Atalanta forward scored 16 goals in his first season but only managed 10 last term.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Fabrizio Romano, who specialises in transfers, has claimed that Napoli have made contact with United over a potential loan deal for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The former Atalanta forward scored just 10 goals across all competitions in 24/25 and looked devoid of confidence for much of a difficult season.",
      "He was left out of Ruben Amorim's squad for Sunday's defeat to Arsenal and faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after the arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo has received a response from Carlos Baleba on social media.",
      "United are reportedly interested in a swoop for Baleba this summer, as they aim to boost up their midfield before the transfer window shuts on September 1. The Seagulls reportedly value their midfielder at over £100million, with some reports hinting at a price tag closer to £120million.",
      "However, a recent report in The Athletic suggested that United have now 'ceased' their pursuit for Baleba for this summer. Despite that, the midfielder continues to be linked with a high-profile move to Old Trafford, although any potential transfer is unlikely to materialise until next year.",

      "Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham are all reportedly targeting a move for Brentford captain Nathan Collins.",
      "The Daily Mail claim that interest in the 24-year-old centre-back is surging – although the Bees may well be highly reluctant to sell. It is claimed that United are keen on adding another defender and Collins may be the perfect candidate.",
      "If Manchester United needed proof that they've signed the right players this summer - Sunday's performance against Arsenal offered some positive indications.",
      "Time will tell if Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo go on to have successful careers at Old Trafford. The new double act were still part of a United side which slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal in their opening fixture of 2025/26.",
      "There was also a worrying repeat of United's inability to convert their chances, with Ruben Amorim hoping that Benjamin Sesko will fix that gaping hole in his team. And yet the Reds' overall performance against a likely Premier League title contender offers some room for optimism.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Ruben Amorim have praised Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha's early impact at Manchester United.",
      "The pair arrived at Old Trafford from Brentford and Wolverhampton Wanderers respectively in big-money deals this summer. Their signings were made with United looking to bolster an attack which scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "Neither player was able to get onto the scoresheet for Ruben Amorim's side during Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at M16. However, both played well in their first competitive game for the Reds with United overall putting on a much improved showing compared to what was often seen for much of last season under their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Read more here",
      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will depend on whether Amorim signs a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "Right now, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton on their books - but neither Amorim nor the fans seem convinced by any of their choices. Onana was periodically swapped out for Bayindir last season, and the duo conceded 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Manchester United have begun the 2025/26 season with a glaring weakness they are still some way short of solving.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side impressed in their 1-0 defeat against Arsenal on Sunday with United's new signings offering a positive impression. Both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo provided glimmers of hope for the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "United pressed impressively, looked more creative and did not let their heads drop after Altay Bayindir's inexplicable goalkeeping error allowed Riccardo Calafiori to put the Gunners ahead.

      "Gary Neville has raised concerns over Manchester United's goalkeeping situation after a mistake from Altay Bayindir against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "The Turkish shot-stopper flapped at a corner and Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori headed in from a yard out. It continued a worrying trend for Bayındır who was at fault for several goals last season under Ruben Amorim - the nadir being United's heavy 4-1 loss at Newcastle.",
      "Read more here",
      "Sky Italia report that AS Roma have held positive discussions with Man United regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "Meanwhile, Corriere dello Sport present a different view, stating that Sancho is taking 'a few more days' to decide on his future.",
      "The outlet adds that Roma manager Gian Piero Gasperini spoke with the 25-year-old, explaining how he could become a key figure in the squad and replicate the form he displayed during his peak at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "It’s also reported that United and Roma have agreed on an initial loan deal, with an option to buy set at €25m (£22m).",
      "Former Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg believes Arsenal's goal against Man United should not have stood and that the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOL) 'failed' to come to the correct verdict over the incident.",
      "United began their season with a 1-0 home defeat to Arsenal, with Riccardo Calafiori scoring the only goal of the match. Despite the loss, United put on a productive display for the home crowd and created several goalscoring opportunities. The improvement was clear, but Clattenburg believes the scoreline could have been different. For Arsenal’s goal, William Saliba seemed to wrestle with Mason Mount, preventing Altay Bayindir from properly punching away the cross.",
      "\"In real time, I did not see any problem with Arsenal’s goal, but when you watch it in slow motion you can see Mason Mount was having his shirt pulled and Bayindir was being impeded while challenging for the ball,\" the former referee said. \"PGMOL said they would punish more this type of challenge, but again they failed.\"",

      "Neville believes Man United need to address a 'glaring' issue before the window slams shut on September 1.",
      "\"In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1, who is dominant in the air, who owns his six-yard box, comes and punches everything and makes a lot of saves to win you points when your defenders make mistakes. I don't know where they are on PSR [the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules], but they might have to magic up a bit more money in the next week or two, or do something on loan. The two that have been mentioned in the last two weeks have been Emi Martinez and [Gianluigi] Donnarumma.",
      "\"The reason I think they would be good goalkeepers for Man Utd is not necessarily because they are the best goalkeepers in Europe, but they are big personalities and characters. You've seen Donnarumma in a European final save those penalties for Italy. He looked like a giant. He's played for PSG in huge games under pressure. Martinez has played in the World Cup final and won it for Argentina. They have played under extreme pressure and they almost walk out with that arrogance and dominance of a goalkeeper - Man United need that.\"",
      "Milan sporting director Igli Tare has confirmed the club's interest in Hojlund this summer.",
      "\"Hojlund is a good option for us,\" he said. \"We’re evaluating him in the coming days, but the transfer market is unpredictable.",
      "\"We know we have to intervene in that position, and we also know they have to be players who can bring something extra to this group.\"",
      "However, Gazzetta dello Sport report that the Serie A side wouldn’t want to offer more than €34–35m (£29–30m), while United are reportedly asking for a package of €45m (£39m), including the loan fee and purchase option.",
      "Manchester United could still sign a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes on September 1.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"The situation involving Emi Martinez has gone completely quiet. But a goalkeeper they still like and are still keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"Very talented goalkeeper, Belgian and United have been monitoring him for a long time. I told you about this interest in July and the beginning of August. This interest remains and if United decide from now until the end of the window to invest on a goalkeeper - Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "\"So could be a possibility. [Gianluigi] Donnarumma, they are aware of the situation but Man City are in concrete talks to sign him. So this is currently the situation for Man United but still, nothing imminent as of now.\"",
      "As expected, Garnacho was nowhere to be seen at Old Trafford for Sunday's game amid ongoing uncertainty over his squad. Despite his threat, there doesn't seem to be dissatisfaction within the fanbase over his exclusion.",
      "Before the clash with the Gunners, a photographer captured a portrait of Garnacho outside Old Trafford that had been tampered with. It appears that one supporter has marked the picture of the forward with an 'X' over his face.",

      "The possibility of including Joshua King in the deal is also rumored.",
      "Man United have previously been linked with an interest in RB Leipzig attacker Simons, who has impressed for both club and country in recent seasons.",
      "However, the 13-time Premier League champions would need to outmaneuver Chelsea’s pursuit of the 22-year-old, as Simons is reportedly leaning towards a move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "United enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and were hopeful of starting the new campaign with a victory, but Arsenal left Manchester with a 1-0 victory after a Riccardo Calafiori goal.",
      "However, Fernandes was hesitant to say the result was unfair. \"I wouldn't say unfair, but I obviously think we came up a little bit short today,\" he said during a post-match interview with MUTV. \"Overall, we did something else to deserve a different result. It's very difficult to see the positive things when you lose the game, but we need to look forward and see next week what we can improve after this game. We will look at what we didn't do so good and what went wrong.\"",
      "When asked about the support from United fans throughout the game, Fernandes added: \"It was brilliant. Like I just said in a previous interview, they talk about hope in the team for what we did and everything.",
      "\"When I finished the game, what gave me hope for the season being very good for us and positive was the way the fans reacted. When we came around and came into the tunnel, they gave us hope with that. The next game is very important for us to give something back.\"",
      "The Sun claims that David De Gea is one of the goalkepers under consideration by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The report states that the Spaniard has a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could allow him to return to the club at a reduced fee. United have just two weeks to strengthen their goalkeeping department this season, with Onana facing heavy scrutiny for his performances both last season and over the summer.",
      "He was left out of Amorim's squad for their Premier League clash with Arsenal. After the game, the Portuguese boss said: \"He's not injured, he's recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.\"",

      "United have reportedly verbally accepted a £20million offer from Roma for the winger, but reaching an agreement with the player is expected to be challenging. TEAMtalk understands that the main obstacle is Sancho’s wage demands.",
      "He currently earns £250,000 a week at United, with a contract running until next summer.",
      "Roma coach Gian Piero Gasperini is personally trying to persuade Sancho, but the player has reportedly shown no willingness to lower his salary for the move.",
      "Man United are reportedly trying to sanction a sale for Rasmus Hojlund before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Fabrizio Romano said: \"Rasmus Hojlund [was] out of the squad and we know that Manchester United are trying to find a solution for him. They want Hojlund to go.",
      "\"They want to sell Hojlund as soon as possible. If a sale is not going to be possible, they want to do a loan with an option to buy – €6m loan fee, an option to buy around €40-45.",

      "Bayindir conceded a similar winner at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-final last season when he was beaten directly from Son Heung-min's corner.",
      "Amorim opted not to start Andre Onana against Arsenal as United's first-choice 'keeper had been involved in only three team training sessions since he recovered from a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing in pre-season.",
      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.\"",
      "Arsenal scored against United from two corners in their 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium last season. Amorim felt United's set-up was naive against a team renowned for their set-piece prowess but also appeared to question the rules.",
      "\"I think you can watch the goal, I think [you’re] allowed to do a lot of things,\" Amorim added. \"In the corners we need to do the same. But when you touch the goalkeeper that way, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not to push players, or he chooses to push the players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules, if it’s allowed we need to do the same thing.",
      "\"I’m saying that you choose to push a player or to get the ball in that moment. So he chooses to get the ball but he gets pushed and cannot defend himself. That is my feeling when I see the play but we need to do the same thing.\"",
      "Onana was not included in the United squad as academy goalie Dermot Mee assisted Bayindir and Heaton in the warm up. Onana is poised to return at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa on loan earlier in the summer but a new goalkeeper has never been a priority and United could end the transfer window without reinforcing that department. Amorim eventually said he was \"happy with the three goalkeepers\".",
      "\"I didn’t drop Onana from the squad,\" Amorim stressed. \"I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad, it’s a case of not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without training. Tom and Altay in pre-season did a good job.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho will not play for Argentina in their upcoming World Cup qualifiers.",
      "Manchester United are set to sell Garnacho in the summer transfer window. The 21-year-old has been training on his own at Carrington for a month and has been frozen out of the squad.",
      "Garnacho was not involved against Arsenal for United's opening game of the season and the youngster has been left out of Argentina's squad for their World Cup qualifying fixtures against Venezuela and Ecuador next month.",
      "The United academy graduate made his Argentina debut in June 2023. Garnacho was consistently included in Argentina's squad throughout 2024, but his country has not called him up this year.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for the Manchester derby in December, but was reintegrated back into the squad, unlike Marcus Rashford, who was loaned to Aston Villa in the January window.",
      "However, there were further discipline issues with Garnacho as the season progressed.",
      "The youngster's relationship with Ruben Amorim deteriorated and he questioned his manager's decision to name him on the bench for the Europa League final against Tottenham in May.",
      "When speaking to journalists in the USA this summer, Amorim was asked whether it was a shame it hadn't worked out with Garnacho. He responded: \"I think Garnacho you can understand and you can see, he's talented, he's a really talented boy. And sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that.",
      "\"So I think it's not a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. So, we try to make everything okay to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. So, it's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Napoli and Chelsea have been linked with a move for Garnacho. The player's representatives attended Stamford Bridge last season and Chelsea are regarded as the front runners for his signature.",
      "Garnacho's sale would represent pure profit within the Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A home defeat without scoring is familiar fare from Manchester United. Their productive performance was unfamiliar.",
      "United were the more enterprising and energetic team, fuelled by the optimistic atmosphere that was enhanced by pre-match adjustments. United fashioned more goalscoring chances in one afternoon against Arsenal than they did in one month last season.",
      "Yet the bottom line is they lost their opening fixture for the eighth time in the Premier League era. United have been beaten 16 times at home in the league since the start of the 2023-24 campaign. Ruben Amorim was not on his haunches as much but his hands were often planted on his crown.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt dropped to the turf at full-time. United players and staff still embarked on a lap of honour. Purists would rather see them head straight down the tunnel for a raw debrief.",
      "Hope is at least back again at United, in spite of another home reverse. The six added minutes elicited an excitable cheer. There was no air of resignation as there was throughout the defeatist performances of last season.",
      "But no striker and no goals. Benjamin Sesko crossed the white line to the sound of an expectant roar in the 65th minute. His inactive cameo partly legislated for why Amorim did not start him.",
      "Few teams are better equipped to defend a lead than Arsenal, a throwback to George Graham's artisans. United were undone by another Arsenal set piece.",
      "This was an archetypal 1-0-to-the-Ar-se-nal. They were second best for the majority of the afternoon and their supporters were constantly irked by the referee, Simon Hooper. They still shielded their goal for 77 minutes whilst leading.",
      "United, having invested almost £74million in a new number nine, played without one. Amorim has refused to accommodate Rasmus Hojlund after he aired his intention to stay and the strikerless experiments against Everton in Atlanta and Fiorentina in Manchester signposted a similar set-up against Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund is so unwanted he was omitted from the matchday squad with Joshua Zirkzee available again. Hojlund, loitering in the tunnel pre-match, watched the first half from the directors' box but was not visible in the second half.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha made up the front three in United's final friendly against Fiorentina. The only goal United managed was an own goal. They lined up together again and this time there was no goal.",
      "Amorim's team was littered with contentious calls and the 'keeper was the costliest. Altay Bayindir was fortunate to play for United again after he conceded a winner direct from a corner at Tottenham in December and it practically happened again against the other north London club.",
      "Bayindir is not better than Tom Heaton, in his 40th year, never mind Andre Onana. United's first choice will reclaim his role at Fulham this week.",
      "Onana himself was cornered by Arsenal in their victory at the Emirates last season. The sight of Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes, stood forlornly in the technical area was as familiar as United trailing at half-time without scoring.",
      "It was in the 27th minute that the absence of Amad and a striker was visible. Mbeumo delayed his pass too long for the overlapping and offside Diogo Dalot, who crossed to an invisible centre forward, much to the supporters' chagrin. The broadcasters zoomed in on a watchful Sesko. Amad was the first game-changer sent on by Amorim.",
      "Sesko remained in the dugout when the first batch of substitutes headed out to warm up a minute into the second half. Zirkzee was among those to limber up. Amad was soon summoned and his sprints along the touchline were more urgent. Sesko joined them five minutes later.",
      "Amad and Bruno Fernandes were the only two players who started in all five of United's pre-season friendlies. To bench Amad was pragmatic, bordering on the negative. United were lifted by his zig-zag bursts into the Arsenal area.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Sesko could have easily joined their opponents. The Stretford End heckled Gyokeres with a rendition of \"You fat b*****d\". It would be diplomatic to describe him as heavy. So heavy that Casemiro caught up with Gyokeres in the United third after losing the ball inside the Arsenal half. The hostility from the United fans continued up to Gyokeres' withdrawal on the hour.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo gave a glimpse of how productive United's new front three could be. They were responsible for the four on-target attempts from United in the first half. Patrick Dorgu pinged the post. Mbeumo had the measure of the rash Riccardo Calafiori, booked in the 42nd minute for a tactical foul. Calafiori was still the only one to get on the scoresheet.",
      "Mount continues to produce his finest work off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with Mount, misguidedly promoted to the Europa League final starting XI at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. Mount and Casemiro were both hooked simultaneously.",
      "United are at risk of giving up on Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro's purported heir. He replaced him and attempted an 88th-minute pot shot that endangered the Stretford Enders and caused his coach to curse.",
      "Hearty applause followed United's near-misses, such was their encouraging play. Eight minutes in, Declan Rice turned to the Arsenal back four and attempted to gee them up. William Saliba's foul on Dorgu was as much to rouse himself and his teammates.",
      "Mikel Arteta almost encroached onto the pitch to berate the wasteful Gabriel Martinelli after a breakaway broke down. One of the Arsenal analysts reacted by smacking the wall of the press box.",
      "Amorim urged United to commence attacks through Luke Shaw. Sometimes United bided their time, waiting for room to free up either side of De Ligt, the meat in the back-three sandwich.",
      "It was another middle centre back Amorim turned to up the other end. Harry Maguire practically played up front in a team that has negotiated a fee upwards of £180m on three strikers. All three were present at the stadium as United fired blanks.",
      "That was familiar.",

      "United started with both Mbeumo and Cunha in attack after their big-money moves from Brentford and Wolves. Both players had chances to score on their debut with David Raya pulling off two class saves.",
      "In the second-half, new signing Benjamin Sesko made his debut but the striker struggled to help United break Arsenal's defence down. Despite the spirited display against one of the Premier League's better sides, Fernandes highlighted the area where they need to get better.",
      "He added: \"We have a big hope for what we want to do and what we want to achieve. There are positive things to look at like scoring goals.",
      "\"I really liked the reaction of the fans at the end. I really appreciate what they did. That was more a sign of hope than what we did during the game.\"",

      "Manchester United's 2025/26 season kickstarted with a narrow defeat to Arsenal on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's men failed to take their chances at Old Trafford in what was an encouraging performance.",
      "The only goal of the game came in the first-half courtesy of Riccardo Calafiori's header. United created a number of opportunities with new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo both coming close.",
      "There were plenty of positives for Amorim to build on in the coming weeks. Patrick Dorgu and Matthijs de Ligt impressed while the early signs of a relationship blossoming between Cunha and Mbeumo are encouraging.",
      "Last season, one of the biggest problems within United's team was their attitude. So many times did players seem disinterested after defeats. Fortunately, it looks as though Amorim has worked on that.",
      "When the final whistle went and Arsenal players celebrated, there was a real feeling of disappointment within the players. Some United players, including Cunha, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro, all dropped to the floor.",
      "Following a season where they were constantly short of quality compared to their opponent, United matched, if not outperformed, Arsenal on Sunday and the reaction of the players.",
      "As expected, Alejandro Garnacho was nowhere to be seen at Old Trafford for Sunday's game amid ongoing uncertainty over his squad. Despite his threat, there doesn't seem to be dissatisfaction within the fanbase over his exclusion.",
      "Before the clash with the Gunners, a photographer captured a portrait of Garnacho outside Old Trafford that had been tampered with. It appears that one supporter has marked the picture of the forward with an 'X' over his face.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo both showed glimpses of what United can expect this season and were perhaps unfortunate not to produce a goal contribution between them.",
      "In the second-half, Cunha looked more like the player that convinced United to pay £72.5million for him. After winning a foul in the corner against William Saliba, the attacker got up and interacted with the fans in the south stand and Stretford End.",
      "The urge for more noise was received well by the thousands of supporters. Cunha's effort was constantly applauded by the fans inside Old Trafford - it was certainly an encouraging debut.",

      "Alan Shearer believes that Manchester United's \"downfall\" this season will depend on whether Ruben Amorim signs a new goalkeeper before the transfer window closes.",
      "The Red Devils showed a much-improved side of themselves in their Premier League opener against Arsenal, despite the 1-0 defeat. The Gunners struck early in the first half through Riccardo Calafiori, when a mistake from keeper Altay Bayındır allowed the defender in at the back post to score.",
      "While United had more shots - on and off target - and a higher percentage of passes and completions, they were unable to capitalise on this pressure for the rest of the game. However, fans will have been impressed with Amorim's side throughout the Premier League outing and the improvements since the end of the previous campaign.",
      "Ex-Newcastle star Shearer was full of praise for the Red Devils over the weekend, but warned the club about their problem area. Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, the Premier League icon also hailed new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for bringing something new to Old Trafford.",
      "Shearer said: \"I think for me the two standouts [Cunha and Mbeumo]. I mean Cunha was very good and Mbeumo was excellent. They brought a bit of unpredictability, they brought a bit of a spark and a bit of life to Manchester United.",
      "\"I do think that there was definitely more energy to the game, they certainly looked more organised, but you would feel more comfortable if they had a goalkeeper in there who you could rely on.",
      "\"I think if they don't get that, then that could be their downfall. It remains to be seen if anything happens in the next couple of weeks. But in terms of general play, I thought it was a lot better from Manchester United.\"",
      "Right now, United have Andre Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton on their books - but neither Amorim nor the fans seem convinced by any of their choices. Onana was periodically swapped out for Bayindir last season, and the duo conceded 58 goals in the Premier League last year.",
      "Onana didn't make the matchday squad for the first game of the season, with 39-year-old veteran Heaton on the bench instead. Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is on United's transfer radar, after he was dropped from the team's travelling squad to face Tottenham in the UEFA Super Cup last week.",
      "His contract in the French capital expires at the end of next season, leaving him free to depart without a transfer fee. With the current tension between player and club, it is likely that the shotstopper will depart Paris this summer for a smaller price, but United rivals Manchester City are currently leading the race for his signature.",
      "AC Milan's Mike Maignan is also a player of interest to the Red Devils, as they continue to discuss a potential swap deal for young striker Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish forward has fallen out of favour with Amorim and looks likely to leave Manchester this summer.",
      "It has also been reported that David De Gea could make a shock return to United following the discovery of a release clause in his Fiorentina contract that could allow him to leave for a reduced fee.",

      "Former Manchester United coach Michael Carrick has shed light on why Scott McTominay didn't fulfil his potential at Old Trafford.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to Napoli last summer and clinched the Serie A title and the league's Most Valuable Player award in his first season. McTominay made a significant impact in Italy, scoring 13 goals and providing six assists in 36 games, quickly becoming a fan favourite in Naples. His recent success contrasts sharply with the scrutiny he faced at United, particularly when he was part of a midfield duo with Fred, often referred to as 'McFred'.",
      "Despite some memorable performances in his final full season at Old Trafford, notching 10 goals across competitions and scoring at pivotal moments for Erik ten Hag's team, McTominay's rise at Napoli caught many by surprise. Carrick, who served as an assistant coach under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, explained that McTominay's talent was always apparent at United, even though he was asked to play a more defensive role.",
      "\"He was always, yeah, we had a bit of a kind of few discussions with it about Scott when we were coaching with Ole and we played a lot with him and Fred and actually had a lot of good success in many ways with the two of them,\" Carrick said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast. \"More defensively, yeah, he could, he was kind of the box-to-box, if you like, done a bit of everything, but more defensive.",
      "\"But he was reliable, he was a fantastic attitude, great to work with. But he always had, and in training, he always had an eye for goal. He was a great finisher. Getting in the box, and he had that, I never really had it, but with certain lads, getting around the box is just that extra bit of time to finish.",
      "\"Like a [Frank Lampard], you know? I know Lamps was obviously best of the best of that, but he's got a sense of that, getting in the box, and it drops to him, like it's goals, he's just finding that.",
      "\"And he always had it, and we tried a couple of times, and just because of the make-up with the team, it didn't quite work at that time, but there was always something in there where you think, he's got goals in him, Scotty.\"",
      "\"I'm so happy that he's gone to do well, because he deserves it,\" Carrick continued. \"I'm sad that it's not at United, because I think he's kind of the one that you want at the club, because he just drives everything, he's a heart and soul, but to see him go on and do well, it speaks volumes, and there's no one taking that. He's had ups and downs, big ups and downs, and he's gone on, and actually he's not looked back now. It's incredible what he's done.\"",
      "The Scotland international, who came up through United's academy and became a first-team regular under Solskjaer by 2019, won the FA Cup and League Cup and reached the 2021 Europa League final during his time at Old Trafford. He made 255 appearances in total for United, and Carrick outlined why McTominay wasn't deployed in a more attacking role until he moved to Napoli.",
      "\"Make-up of the team, the dynamics, whatever,\" Carrick explained. \"Look at England, you know, you've had it with England over the years. Why does it not work with England? Sometimes it's not an individual thing, it's a dynamic, it's the make-up of the group, it's the atmosphere surrounding it, that's what I'm saying.",
      "\"It's not always just about that football or that game, there's kind of feelings around it sometimes that affect everyone's judgement, you know, it's not always as straightforward as that.\"",
      "While Carrick argues that McTominay played a deeper midfield role to maintain the balance of the team, the player himself believes he was misunderstood after being promoted to United's first team. The 28-year-old was prepared to play wherever he was required and believed he could be more consistent than some of his team-mates, but this attitude may have stopped him from claiming his best position in the United side.",
      "\"When I got into the first team, I was quite misprofiled in where I was playing,\" McTominay recalled to The Athletic in April. \"It wasn't the fault of any coaches. My strengths have always been getting into the box, scoring goals, being a problem in there.",
      "\"But I was being used as a number six or as a centre-back, and that has never really been my game. But when you're playing for Manchester United and you're 20, you can't knock on the manager's door and say that you expect to be playing at number eight ahead of Paul Pogba. It's not realistic.\"",
      "\"You have to know your place, and do what you're asked to do,\" he added. \"In the last few seasons, I began to get into the box a bit more, to score more goals, and then last year was my best one.",
      "\"They would always sign someone who wouldn't necessarily be what people expected them to be. My mentality was that I was always there, ready to go, ready to take my opportunity. I always wanted to prove my worth, to show I could play every game. It's not the sort of thing that affects me. You can only be in control of what you do.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been compared to Manchester United great Sir Alex Ferguson for his cutthroat character.",
      "That's according to former Red Devil Wes Brown after the Portuguese tactician has been unabashed in making sweeping changes since arriving at Old Trafford. United opened their Premier League campaign with a close-run 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "There was cause for optimism, however, after United had the lion's share of scoring opportunities despite coming off second-best thanks to Riccardo Calafiori's early decider. Summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha played the entire 90 minutes in their official United debuts, while Rasmus Hojlund was dropped from the squad altogether.",
      "Altay Bayindir, whose performance was questioned by Gary Neville after his hand in Calafiori's goal, also started between the posts while rumours continue to swirl around Andre Onana's future.",
      "Amorim, 40, has shown a willingness to make brave calls in his squad selection since replacing Erik ten Hag in November 2024. And Sunday backed up Brown's previous assertion as to how the incumbent is similar to club great Ferguson in that sense.",
      "\"I remember first coming in and Sir Alex got rid of big names,\" he told The Athletic earlier this month in Chicago. \"They’d been brilliant for him over the years, but just like that – gone. That’s the best way to do it.",
      "\"He’s signed a few players who can play in different positions, especially those who have done really well in the Premier League. That’s a massive thing, something we’ve missed.\"",
      "Brown, who made his Premier League debut for United in 1998, first entered the club's first-team set-up at a time of transition for Ferguson. He had led the Red Devils to major honours with the likes of Gary Pallister, Brian McClair, Lee Sharpe and Steve Bruce in the mid-1990s, but wasn't afraid to move on big talents when the time felt right.",
      "Onana and Hojlund were signed under Ten Hag's reign in the summer of 2023 for a combined potential fee of around £115million. Both are being linked with transfers away from United this summer, though Amorim insisted on Sunday that Onana's absence was due to a lack of training and fitness.",
      "Bayindir's failure to dominate his area at an early Declan Rice corner unfortunately highlighted the goalkeeper situation at Old Trafford once more. Familiar struggles emerged in attack, though Mbeumo and Cunha did look promising, while fellow new signing Benjamin Sesko could only do so much in his 25-minute cameo off the bench.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were also omitted from United's first squad of the Premier League season. Each among the quartet has been tipped to leave the club this summer, providing more evidence of Amorim's conviction in his calls.",
      "That's in addition to academy graduate and former golden child Marcus Rashford already being loaned out to Barcelona this summer. And with January arrival Patrick Dorgu also impressing down United's left flank on Sunday, Amorim's imprint is steadily taking shape at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "The final fortnight of the summer transfer window could yield even more change, with certain sellable stars still technically on the books. However, Amorim's unwillingness to involve them despite the pressure of the Premier League returning shows a staunch commitment not too unlike Ferguson himself.",

      "Manchester United lost their opening game of the new season in a 1-0 defeat at home to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will take plenty of encouragement from the performance at Old Trafford with new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha impressing. There will now be hope that Benjamin Sesko can deliver the goals United so badly need after they drew another blank over the weekend.",
      "And many Reds fans will also be hoping to see a new midfielder arrive before the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have been most heavily linked in recent weeks.",
      "Below are some of the latest United headlines as well as a view on each one.",
      "Athletic journalist David Ornstein has quashed any chance of United pulling off a move for Wharton this summer.",
      "\"They've been linked to the likes of [Martin] Hjulmand at Sporting Lisbon and Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace,\" he told NBC Sports on Sunday.",
      "\"I'm not sure those are likely to come to fruition at this moment in time; they want to get players out of here, and Andre Onana is an interesting situation.",
      "\"They would look for a new goalkeeper, but there's no sign of him going at the moment. Garnacho, there is a good chance he goes to Chelsea. Jadon Sancho, Roma [are] in talks, club-to-club, but he hasn't decided.",
      "\"Rasmus Hojlund his time here looks to be coming towards an end. He's not involved today. Tyrell Malacia could also leave the club.\"",
      "Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham are all reportedly targeting a move for Brentford captain Nathan Collins.",
      "The Daily Mail claim that interest in the 24-year-old centre-back is surging – although the Bees may well be highly reluctant to sell. It is claimed that United are keen on adding another defender and Collins may be the perfect candidate.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United ‘can afford’ top midfield target Carlos Baleba this summer and ‘could revive a deal’ for the Brighton star despite reports claiming they’ve walked away from his possible transfer.",
      "The Red Devils have held talks over a move for Baleba via intermediaries and then directly with Brighton this month to sound them out over a deal, but with the Seagulls wanting £100m+, The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed on Friday that United had decided not to push ahead with talks.",
      "‘Manchester United are not planning to proceed with a move for Carlos Baleba before the transfer window closes,’ he wrote.",
      "‘Moving to Old Trafford appeals to Baleba so personal terms would have presented no problem — and the Cameroon international is prepared to keep pushing, even if it means waiting until the future.",
      "‘That does not suggest he is unhappy at Brighton and the dialogue has been cordial, with United respecting their stance.’",
      "But The Standard, while offering no more information besides, claim ‘a deal could be revived’ for the 21-year-old, and football finance expert Dan Plumley insists United “can afford him if they want him”.",
      "Plumley told Football Insider: “Ultimately, and we’ve said this before with other players this summer, Man United can afford him if they want him.",
      "“They have got options to draw upon. There’s a credit facility, a revolving one that we think has been drawn down.",
      "“We’ve seen the way they’ll stagger instalments for other players that they’ve brought in as well.",
      "“In terms of general affordability, the answer is still yes. I think the interesting thing on the fee is if it is going to be £100m or in and around that figure, then it probably won’t happen this summer.",
      "“That would be the other way to look at it, because that then is a significant outlay on top of what they’ve already spent this summer.",
      "“If the fee’s gonna be that high, I think that probably means they wouldn’t look at him this summer, but if they think a deal can be done further down the line, next year seems more likely.",
      "“Can they afford him this summer? Yes, in the bigger picture, but £100m now, given where the window’s at, probably not.”",
      "Manchester United have given up on signing Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba this summer, per David Ornstein.",
      "A Manchester United legend has told the club they “can’t pay” £100million for a “kid’ they don’t know “which way he’s going to go,” but the key to the transfer ...",
      "Brighton manager Fabian Hurzeler has revealed he is “very confident” that Carlos Baleba will stay amid interest from Manchester United, as he revealed the “only change” the midfielder has made.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd ‘contacts are continuing on a daily basis’ with Brighton and Carlos Baleba’s agent.",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives.",
      "Man Utd have identified Feyenoord midfielder Quinten Timber as a potential alternative to Brighton star Carlos Baleba, according to reports."

Napoli asked for loan deal conditions for Rasmus Højlund. Man United want to keep Joshua Zirkzee, no talks despite links today. Clear plan by Rúben Amorim.’",

      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "But the Cameroon may be offered the chance of an exit according to The Sun, who claim former club Inter ‘are interested in re-signing a player who was a massive success in Italy’, whom United signed from them for £46m in the summer of 2023.",

      "“The referee is spot on. VAR isn’t going to get involved because it’s not a clear and obvious error. Players often exaggerate their fall when a foul has taken place, and that exaggeration often makes the referee not give it.",

      "He added: “I was less than satisfied with the referee’s performance. When you’ve got fouls taking place, but the referee is completely ignoring them without a signal of advantage, it opens up the question of whether he’s seen it or not.",
      "“Hooper’s approach was, ‘I’ll keep the game going. I’ll stay low-key’, but in doing so, the game at times was bubbling. The discipline of both sets of players was good so that helped him.",
      "“But, he was inconsistent and lacked authority, lacked an understanding of when to put his foot on the ball. It was an indifferent performance, and he was lucky not to have a mass confrontation.",

And Besiktas are keen but Sancho is said to be unwilling to consider Turkey until he absolutely has to, when their window remains open after the others shut. Roma, you would think, would be a very appealing option if the exiled winger is serious about kickstarting his career. But no. Despite Roma agreeing a fee with United, Sancho isn’t happy with the terms on offer. Which makes you wonder what or who the f*** he’s waiting for.",

      "19) Morten Hjulmand – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nBrighton are refusing to sell Carlos Baleba, so Hjulmand is next on United’s list, apparently. The Dane has worked with Ruben Amorim and knows his system but links with United pre-date the manager’s appointment at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old would be available for around half the price Brighton expect for Baleba.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nNapoli have been in touch with United to ask about what they might want to let the Serie A champions borrow Hojlund with Romelu Lukaku crocked for around three months. Which might be tempting for the player but United will be holding out for a permanent move.",

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too. Friday night’s chaos against Bournemouth might spring them into action, mind.",

There will be more talks and it could change very quickly, but as things stand, the Blues are standing firm over demanding a permanent transfer and the fee that would involve.",
      "",
      "15) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National. Given Liverpool face Newcastle next Monday night, it seems most likely that something will happen after that.",

And Dibling was back in the Southampton squad for the draw at Ipswich on Sunday. Lots of numbers have been chucked around, but it seems Everton’s latest offer was worth £40million inclusive of add-ons, while Southampton are holding out for closer to £50million.",

      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player has not taken it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media. Ooh, you’re hard.",

      "12) 🔽 Rico Lewis – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\n“I think he is going to stay. I think. He told me that. But maybe tomorrow it changes.” Lewis seems very keen to stay but if City decide they want to cash in, there’s little the academy graduate can do. The right-back started at Wolves on Saturday, though, so he’s certainly not surplus to requirements.",

      "11) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found.",
      "",
      "10) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",

      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nThis one has gone a little quiet in recent days but reports suggest Simons is still focused on a Chelsea deal, despite interest from Manchester City. Leipzig, for now, are standing by their valuation of at least £55million and they don’t appear to have been moved by Chelsea’s attempts to throw Nkunku in as part of the deal. It is clear Chelsea need to shift some deadwood before they can sign more forwards.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nHojlund was left out of the United squad beaten by Arsenal which suggests something is afoot, most likely involving Milan. “Hojlund is a good option for us,” said their sporting director Igli Tare on Sunday. “We are thinking about him, but in the transfer market, you never know what could happen.” United want around £30million; Milan would obviously prefer to pay less or take the Denmark striker on loan first.",

It was just a coincidence that it occurred around the same time an £8.6million offer arrived from Galatasaray. If City have decided they want Donnarumma, then Ederson will be off. They want double the amount offered by the Turkish but the expectation is that a compromise can be reached.",

The Brazilian has been pants in Italy but his performances for Villa are still fresh enough in the memory to believe that this could be a fine addition.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit.

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been warned his career could fizzle out like Rasmus Hojlund’s by Frank Leboeuf, who feels he could become a “useless” Arsenal signing.",
      "The Swede’s Arsenal debut lasted all of 60 minutes with him making little impact on the match, causing a mass pile-on from some harsher sections of the media.",
      "But while plenty have given him the benefit of the doubt given it was only one game, Leboeuf has told Mikel Arteta to change his tactics to suit Gyokeres or risk having a Hojlund situation in his hands.",
      "“My concern is, why do you recruit a player like Gyokeres when you know that the rest of the team won’t play that way?” Leboeuf asked on ESPN. “And they won’t do what you are expecting them to do – cross the ball a little bit quicker, without turning around, like you are playing handball.”",

      "“You have a player that you need to cross the ball to as quickly as possible, and if you block it, and you make it slow, that guy is useless.",
      "“So why do you use a type of player like that? Why do you sign a player like that when, in fact, the rest of the team doesn’t understand him or his way of thinking about football?",
      "“For me, it’s useless. And I really thought, I hope he’s going to change and score goals and everything. But I thought Hojlund signed for Arsenal and played today against his former teammates. That was the way I saw Gyokeres today.",
      "“So I really hope that he’s not going to have the same path, you know, like Hojlund, and score many, many goals for the Gunners.",
      "“But today, he was nowhere near it, because it wasn’t at the same level of music as the others are playing. The others were playing a kind of sloppy but slow-motion game while he was trying to get more vertical – one ball, one opportunity, one cross. It never happened.”",
      "Trying to take the hat off his new striker, Arteta said in his post-match press conference that zero shots on target from the Swede showed a team problem, not an individual one.",

      "“It is something that we have to work on with him, especially there. Then in the final action situation, he did not have that many chances to do that, because in the previous action, we had to play that last ball and the last was standing still with 40 metres to play.",

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "19) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "18) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "12=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "12=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "12=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "12=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "12=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "8=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "6=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "6=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "5) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start this season as they ended last one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",

      "Onana‘s long-term future at Man Utd is in doubt after his form fell off a cliff during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "The experienced goalkeeper had a decent debut season after replacing David De Gea, but his performances dramatically declined as he was deservedly criticised for his poor form.",
      "This has fuelled speculation linking Man Utd with potential replacements, though they are yet to sign a new goalkeeper in this transfer window.",
      "Onana missed a portion of pre-season due to injury, so Alter Bayindir started in goal for Man Utd’s opening game of the 2025/26 Premier League season on Sunday as the Red Devils were beaten 1-0.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Sunderland shine, Potter sack, Man City and Chiesa click, Brentford ‘naive’",
      "It was initially assumed that Onana’s absence was due to his injury status, though head coach Ruben Amorim insisted before the match that he has “recovered”.",
      "“It’s an option. We try to choose the best players for each game. Next week is a different life and in this week we chose this way,” Amorim said on omitting Onana and Rasmus Hojlund for the Arsenal match.",
      "When pressed further on Onana’s absence, he added: “No, no he’s not injured, he’s recovered… but the other players did well during pre-season, so I have to find a balance.”",
      "Despite this, Romano claims Onana’s “feeling” is that he was left out of United’s squad becuase hs is “not at 100% form yet”.",
      "“Ruben Amorim after the game said they didn’t drop Onana. At the same time, I can tell you that the feeling of those close to Onana is that it was because Onana is still recovering from injury and is not at 100% form yet,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“And he accepted the decision. He doesn’t believe it’s to do with transfers. Also because Onana is not in any active talks with another club.",
      "“There was some interest in Saudi at the beginning of the window. He accepted the decision of Amorim but it’s another story next week.”",
      "Romano has also commented on two potential replacements for Onana, with a deal for one “completely quiet”.",
      "“The last bid they made was for Emi Martinez was a loan proposal in July. For the moment, that situation has gone completely quiet,” Romano added.",
      "“The goalkeeper they still like and are keeping an eye on is Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp. They’ve been monitoring him for a long time.",
      "“If Man Utd decide to invest in a goalkeeper between now and the end of the window, Lammens is the goalkeeper they like.",
      "“They’re aware of the Donnarumma situation, but Manchester City are in concrete talks to sign him. There’s still nothing imminent.”",

      "Brighton’s £100m+ price tag ended United’s interest in the 21-year-old Cameroonian but it seems the Old Trafford side are not done in the transfer market with two weeks left to go.",
      "33-year-old Casemiro starting against Arsenal at the weekend highlighted United’s need for midfield reinforcements and Ferdinand believes that strengthening that area should come in the form of Wharton.",
      "“We’ve been talking about Baleba, he’s been the hot topic for the last month or so, but before that, Adam Wharton was one of the guys I was saying,” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“He’s the nearest to a Michael Carrick type, who’s a controller, who can play, who plays forward from that deeper line position at times. He can be an eight if you need him to be and can run on at times if need be, but he’s more of a conductor and can control things.",
      "“I watched him in a couple of games last season against big teams like Man City and Liverpool, and he looks unfazed. He looks ready for a big occasion.",
      "“He enjoys pressure, can play under pressure, and the game kind of slows down when the ball is around him. I love him. I think he’s a fantastic footballer.”",
      "If United were to follow Ferdinand’s advice, they could have a battle on their hands to sign the England international with Real Madrid reportedly keen to bring him to Spain. If United were to fail in their pursuit of Wharton, Ferdinand pointed towards another young talent already at the club.",

A related issue or concern is why did Amorim field a team with no natural striker, even though the striker or rather lack of an effective striker has plagued United for some time. There is no excuse for this strategic shortcoming, exacerbated by the fact that we were playing against Arsenal. Did Arsenal bench Gyokeres? No he started. Did Liverpool bench Ekitike? Of course not.",

I won’t speak for every Gooner, but having watched Saliba, Gabriel & Raya for a few years now, I never felt worried that Utd would score. I was only concerned that Cunha would eventually flop his way into a cheap penalty.",

Sure, they didn’t look as clueless as the majority of last season, but other than Cunha’s shot that was well saved, they didn’t really trouble Arsenal. Sure they had a lot of possession and the stats will tell you they had a lot of shots on goal, but the vast majority were very easily dealt with.",

So Isak would cost some 200m over 5 years and Gyokeres 110m. I also find it hilarious to say hes “available” when hes currently on strike not playing for any teams since hes so “available”.

To follow that up against Burnley, with a no nonsense, very professional, clean cut 3-0 win was just perfect.

Maybe Janelt when he returns from injury could play that role but either way it’s a step down",

      "Four debutants is as many as a reigning champion has ever named in their starting line-up of a Premier League opening weekend game. The accepted wisdom is never to change a winning team but Liverpool did so out of necessity and used that opportunity to build from a position of power.",
      "This is basically a new side, albeit with many familiar composite parts. Trent Alexander-Arnold was uniquely critical to how Liverpool defended and attacked on and off the ball. An element of unpredictability and instability when moving away from that is inevitable even when the most important gear in their midfield machine becomes available and players build fitness and rhythm.",
      "Yet it was the only first-team addition of last season’s £10m spend who stepped up to spare some rather more uncomfortable questions being asked of this summer’s £300m binge.",
      "Only in two of his previous Premier League appearances has Chiesa been given more than the eight minutes afforded to him to make a difference against Bournemouth. Injuries have hampered the Italian but it did always seem a largely pointless, opportunistic signing for such a strong frontline.",
      "This summer has, however, opened up an unlikely space for a wildcard forward beloved by the fanbase and popular within the squad, the sort crucial to any successful team. When the main cast members falter and fade, the ensemble needs to be trusted and Chiesa has that now.",
      "Even Darwin Nunez, who never convinced and was deemed dispensable at the right price, could list a number of game-changing moments he produced when called upon. No-one will ever play the role better than Divock Origi but that final roll of the dice, fifth and final substitution suggested Chiesa can give a passable impression, which is all Liverpool need from him as a £10m forward surrounded by those signed for far more.",
      "Those dissenting voices doubting Liverpool’s title defence can and should still be heard. Many aspects of the overall plan made little sense on the pitch and Slot will know that flexibility in his ideas is necessary. A title-winning campaign should not look the same at the end as it did at the beginning because lessons are learned and acted upon; last season started with Jarell Quansah at centre-half so the coach has earned a certain level of faith in his ability.",
      "The hope will be that when the time comes to review this season, Chiesa’s bench-based brilliance has become frequent enough to be no surprise. But after a year of struggles and setbacks, he earned that one spell in the spotlight.",
      "",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo\nThe most possession Nottingham Forest had in any Premier League game last season was 55% against Brentford at home; they lost 2-0 and Nuno spoke post-match about finding “better solutions”.",
      "With the same amount of the ball against the same opponent at the same venue – and with nine of the same players starting – three months later, Forest converted their territorial advantage into what was at times total dominance.",
      "That is testament to a tactical adaptability many felt was beyond Nuno, who had only previously coached 11 of his 71 Premier League wins with at least as much of the ball.",
      "The difficult second album has at least started with a compelling track.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo\nBournemouth were a compelling mirror image of Liverpool as a side finding its feet defensively while retaining an innate ability to hurt any opponent going forward.",
      "It has been a difficult summer and a slight deviation from their stated stepping-stone plan of never sanctioning more than two first-team sales in the same season. A new keeper, centre-half and left-back might have been grateful for an easier first assignment.",
      "But in basically bringing those pre-season shooting videos to life, Semenyo proved that his new contract might have been the best possible business Bournemouth could have conducted this summer.",
      "How depressing that it was destined to be framed as a response to one prick rather than being a showcase of an excellence it is easy to imagine the 25-year-old replicating on grander stages.",
      "Yet in retaining control over that situation and basically fool-proofing their attack for at least another season, Bournemouth have guaranteed their eventual reward for helping produce such a phenomenal talent and character. That is what they do and they are damn good at it.",
      "",
      "Newcastle without Alexander Isak\nAfter a summer spent self-injuriously and painstakingly proving they are not a particularly big club – or at least not at all well-versed in navigating the sharp end of the sport – how relieved Newcastle must have been to remind the Premier League they remain a big team.",
      "It has been a chastening transfer window but even that is starting to turn around in terms of signings and the petering out of a saga which, for better or worse, need no longer dominate the discourse and cloud the outlook. There can be few better distractions than the return of actual football.",
      "Alexander Isak not being front and centre of every discussion can only benefit Newcastle, even if his absence remained a talking point purely because of what they were missing. But that was more as a concept rather than an individual.",
      "The Magpies did almost everything right up until the final action and a competent, reliable centre-forward can solve that. The position is made for Isak if he is willing to run off all the humble pie headed his way if the deadline passes without a move.",
      "But selling him and reinvesting those funds in a natural goalscorer while improving depth and quality across the rest of an already very good squad really isn’t the worst scenario either.",
      "Newcastle were really good without Isak, can be much better with him, but could be even better than that if they sold up and got the next few recruitment calls right. Against all odds and contrary to popular opinion all summer, it is a decent position to be in.",
      "",
      "Spurs\nAnother club who will welcome the opportunity to take their collective mind off transfer nonsense by getting down to the far less important business of kicking a bag of air around. Doing so at home to a Scott Parker team was a blessing.",
      "The Super Cup performance indicated Spurs can hold their own against better sides; this showed they can sweep lesser opponents away through moments of sheer individual brilliance outside a solid structure already installed by Thomas Frank. They have already matched last season’s points haul at home to promoted teams.",
      "The luxury of having forwards signed for £60m, £55m and £47.5m rather than being made to sell them will be among the bigger differences Frank finds in his new role. It certainly helped decide his first game and settle the nerves.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nThere is a lot to be said for winning against the balance of play. Even more so away, considering the only other side to do so on the opening weekend was a Manchester City team given the slightly easier task of trekking down to Wolves.",
      "It is the sort of result Arsenal would not have been able to grind out before and that should be reflected in the analysis. The softer, more pliable Gunners of years gone by would have drawn or even lost, wilting under the pressure.",
      "The room for improvement was clear, but so too was evidence of how far they have come.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace\nIn their last 10 games, Palace have visited Chelsea, Liverpool, Spurs and Arsenal and hosted Nottingham Forest, while visiting Wembley three times to face the two most recent Premier League champions and a Champions League quarter-finalist.",
      "They have remained unbeaten throughout, winning the first two major trophies in the club’s existence.",
      "Their continued wranglings with obscure rules and regulations must be a little annoying but having the best pound-for-pound coaching in the league is a fine consolation.",
      "",
      "Rodrigo Muniz\nA better minutes-per-goal rate than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ian Wright, Diego Costa, Andy Cole, Didier Drogba, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Robbie Fowler.",
      "It’s why Muniz might be a £40m Champions League striker soon. And why Fulham should give him a pay rise and starting spot to prevent that happening.",
      "",
      "Josh King\nWill be tipped for the England World Cup squad at some point before the end of the season. The early favourite is Rio Ferdinand while calling King an elite filthy baller or some such.",

      "Graham Potter\nIt seems remarkably, forebodingly early to be issuing votes of confidence. Eight teams had not even started their Premier League season before West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady was talking about a club that does not “panic about its managers”.",
      "Perhaps they should.",
      "It also feels disconcertingly premature for said manager to be discussing the need to “bounce back” while repeatedly lamenting the lack of “the basics”. The argument behind keeping Potter despite the struggles endured last campaign revolved around him needing a pre-season to properly get his ideas across, yet no team looked nearly as unready or rudimentary over the opening weekend.",
      "West Ham were in control until the precise moment they weren’t, when a team mostly unversed in the ways of the Premier League bullied and subdued them.",
      "Potter was right when he said: “If we don’t do the basics right, you can bring in player and player and player and player and it’s not going to solve the problems.” But the same can be said of the individual paid handsomely to ensure those basics are actually in place in time for the new season.",
      "READ NEXT: Who will be the first Premier League manager to be sacked?",
      "",
      "Brentford\nKeith Andrews cannot have been particularly surprised that the youngest Brentford starting line-up in Premier League history, managed by someone overseeing the first senior game of their coaching career, showed “a little naivety”.",
      "A bolshy Nottingham Forest side away would have been a difficult assignment for any team, never mind one in such a state of flux.",
      "There are the makings of a decent team with those composite parts Brentford have assembled in trying to remake the 2022 version of Liverpool – and Mikkel Damsgaard’s return should boost them – but Dango Ouattara will need to start the theme of any and all new signings hitting the ground running.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim\nIt was a vast improvement. But that Opta stat about it being the fastest a manager has reached 15 defeats in the Premier League without taking charge of a newly-promoted team in that period since Paul Hart is very funny.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa\nHow curious that one of only three teams who didn’t name an outfield summer signing in their starting line-up would put in arguably the most disjointed, confused performance.",
      "There is a sense that not only does Villa’s season hang in the balance of the final couple of weeks of this transfer window, but that it is more true for them than any other side.",
      "That was reinforced by Unai Emery’s impassioned thoughts on financial restrictions before the game, the vocal fan sentiment during it, and the level of frustration at stagnation after, fuelled by having three shots to 16 at home to a fellow prospective glass-ceiling shatterer who have also had a difficult summer.",
      "Even the impact of their only debutant showed the benefits of keeping the pack fresh, the options plentiful and the competition healthy. But 34-year-old Marco Bizot, purchased for a small undisclosed fee and immediately showing up Robin Olsen, cannot remain their best signing this season if they wish to maintain this upward trajectory.",
      "",
      "Chelsea\nIt will be interesting to see what comes of Enzo Maresca rocking the Chelsea boat ever so slightly instead of toeing the company line. The Italian was appointed in part because of his malleability to the club’s stated transfer policy, so going against that to request more signings was a change in tack.",
      "But it did feel like Maresca was rewarding Josh Acheampong rather than using him as a message to the board like Jose Mourinho or Antonio Conte would. Jeremie Boga started the opening day of the 2017/18 season, was substituted on 18 minutes after a red card and then got loaned out to the Championship; history will not repeat itself here.",
      "A fine performance from the 19-year-old is unlikely to sate Maresca’s transfer desires. When Chelsea get up to speed after their Club World Cup excursions it seems likely Levi Colwill’s absence will only be more obvious.",
      "",
      "Djordje Petrovic\nThe conceder of nine goals in three appearances against Liverpool, all scored by different players which have the makings of a really solid if slightly attacking starting line-up: Bradley, Van Dijk, Szoboszlai, Diaz, Jota, Gakpo, Chiesa, Salah, Ekitike.",

      "And now the Egyptian is the joint-favourite for the 2025/26 award after the opening weekend of action.",
      "",
      "8=) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nA goal in the Community Shield and then another in the opening Premier League game v Manchester United puts the Frenchman higher in the betting than Virgil van Dijk or Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "",
      "8=) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nA shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",
      "",
      "8=) Phil Foden (Manchester City)\nGenuinely odd inclusion after a pretty universally rotten 24/25. But he is a former winner.",
      "",
      "7) Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nIt literally took about 45 minutes against Wolves to convince everybody that the Dutchman is absolutely brilliant and could help win Manchester City another title.",

      "6) Declan Rice (Arsenal)\nIt’s interesting that Viktor Gyokeres is a rank outsider for the PFA award when his signing is likely to be the difference between being runners-up and finally winning some kind of trophy. But Rice is clearly a popular figure with his peers.",
      "",
      "1=) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nThe favourite to win the Golden Boot is a former winner and really quite likely to score the goals to win the Premier League.",
      "",

      "",
      "1=) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nA curious one this but worth noting that he was an early favourite in the 24/25 betting before he got injured. Maybe everybody thinks he is due a trophy. He was poor against Manchester United in the opening game.",
      "",
      "1=) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nThe most expensive signing of the summer has to be on this list. There can be no bedding-in period when you cost upwards of £100m. If Liverpool are to retain the title, Wirtz needs to deliver a banger."

Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",

Based on the very early evidence this weekend, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",

      "– We need Emi Martinez. Not Donnarumma, we need somebody who is commanding between the sticks.",
      "– Mbeumo and Cunha played well. But we have too many players for certain positions and how Ruben is going to use them and play at their best positions will be an issue.",
      "– As a team we played well but didn’t create enough. That will improve with our 3 new signings spending more time on the pitch together. With almost only one game every week there is no need to rest our main XI so it is best Ruben strategizes Bruno’s and Amad’s respective roles with them 3 forwards.",
      "– Still 2 more weeks for the transfer market remain. UTD must dig deep to move on players who have been told that they don’t fit in months ago. No positive outgoing movement is a concern. Hopefully them moving will provide us the funds to get a GK and a robust midfielder.",

Alongside Cunha and Mbuemo, Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw, Dorgu, and Mount were all superb. We played some excellent stuff, were absurdly denied a stonewall penalty, and were just vastly, galactically improved from last season.",
      "Yes Bayinidir is rubbish – hopefully we get a new keeper sorted, but we look a completely different side. I know it’s easy to write low-effort snarky lines about United – and we have been shite for a while, so deserved it – but maybe some new schtick is order, because (and I realise we’ve just 0-1 to Arsenal but nonetheless) we’re f**king back. Top 5 this season for sure.\nBen, MUFC",

And if you are moaning about Saliba’s non-foul, imagine a scenario where the goal is disallowed but a penalty immediately given for the exact same offence (much worse) by Cunha on Zubimendi.

      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "These players were all uncapped at the time of their signing; whether they went on to represent England is immaterial.",
      "",
      "20) Ryan Sessegnon (Fulham to Tottenham, £25m to £30m, August 2019)\nIt is a dreadful shame that the 25-year-old Sessegnon remains uncapped. A total of 57 appearances in five seasons for Spurs leaves no mystery as to the problem for a talented player who has been derailed by injuries.",
      "The more comfortable climate of Fulham has inspired a career renaissance from a player happy to concentrate on finding his feet again at club level.",
      "MORE TRANSFER COVERAGE FROM F365\n👉 The 20 biggest transfers in the world in the 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Chelsea leapfrog Liverpool on biggest transfer summer spenders of 2025 list",
      "",
      "19) James Trafford (Burnley to Manchester City, £27m to £31m, July 2025)\nBurnley were claiming this was a British record fee for a goalkeeper while Manchester City were briefing that they had only paid an initial £27m for their former keeper. Any which way, it’s a decent whack of money for an uncapped player. But that status will surely only last so long…he was in the England picture even while in the Championship.",
      "",
      "18) Jordan Pickford (Sunderland to Everton, £25m to £30m, June 2017)\n“The club’s only going forward, so it’s the best thing I can be doing,” said Pickford upon his move from Sunderland to Everton, who had just finished 7th in the Premier League and have come 8th, 8th, 12th, 10th, 16th, 17th, 15th and 13th in the subsequent eight campaigns.",
      "His first England call-up came that August before his Three Lions debut in the November. No-one has been able to out-rave him between the sticks for his country in the meantime; Pickford is two clean sheets clear of Gordon Banks and just three behind David Seaman.",
      "",
      "17) Noni Madueke (PSV to Chelsea, £30m, January 2023)\nNever has a club spent more money in a January transfer window, but even at £30m Madueke was only their fourth most expensive signing in a hectic month.",
      "It has not been entirely plain sailing since but the 23-year-old is a Premier League hat-trick scorer with three assists in six England caps.",
      "",
      "16) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Leicester to Chelsea, £30m, June 2024)\nIt was probably not part of the grand recruitment push to offer four times as many Conference League as Premier League minutes but that was the fate which befell Dewsbury-Hall when he accompanied Enzo Maresca to Chelsea.",
      "The Leicester Supporters’ and Players’ Player of the Season was lost in the shuffle in his first year at Stamford Bridge, and the only likely change will be fewer consolatory European opportunities for Dewsbury-Hall now Chelsea are back in the Champions League.",
      "",
      "15) Archie Gray (Leeds to Tottenham, £30m, July 2024)\nLeeds were ‘heartbroken’ to lose the boyhood brilliance of an academy product Brentford bid £35m for and, according to some outlets, Tottenham paid up to £40m to sign.",
      "Gray perhaps didn’t realise he was signing up for a ludicrously confusing season spent playing in about five different positions for a team which finished 17th and won the Europa League, but Ange Postecoglou knew he could lean on a teenager with 32 combined caps for England U15s, U16s, U17s, U19s, U20s and U21s.",
      "",
      "14) Liam Delap (Ipswich to Chelsea, £30m, June 2025)\nIpswich knew and readily embraced their role as the stepping stone for Delap, even if they might have envisaged a fine full debut Premier League season for the striker being enough to keep them up.",
      "The odds are that Delap would have jumped ship regardless with such a tempting release clause but a dozen goals in an unsuccessful fight against relegation confirmed it.",
      "The only variable was which club would be fortunate enough to inherit the Manchester City academy product; Chelsea will do their best to ruin the slightly unhinged madman.",
      "",
      "13) Jarell Quansah (Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m to £35m, July 2025)\nA winner of the U19 and U21 Euros, having captained England at various levels and been on Gareth Southgate’s standby list for Euro 2024, is destined to make the senior grade at some point.",
      "Quansah was even in Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad and Liverpool will be among those keen to monitor how he fares in Germany.",
      "",
      "12) Tino Livramento (Southampton to Newcastle, £32m, August 2023)\nSigned by Saints from Chelsea for just £5m in 2021, right-back Livramento earned Southampton a massive profit after just 34 appearances, his spell cruelly curtailed by injury.",
      "That likely contributed to his slow start at Newcastle, eventually turning out 35 times in his debut season and helping gradually wean Eddie Howe off his Kieran Trippier fix.",
      "",
      "11) Ollie Watkins (Brentford to Aston Villa, £28m to £33m, September 2020)\nOne season as a centre-forward was enough to tempt Aston Villa into parting with up to £33m for Watkins in September 2020. Those £5m in add-ons have surely been achieved across 87 goals, 18 England caps and Champions League qualification.",
      "",
      "10) Lewis Hall (Chelsea to Newcastle, £28m to £35m, July 2024)\nWith only 12 career appearances to his name by the time he joined Newcastle on loan, Hall was rather unsurprisingly not in the England picture.",
      "A first season with the Magpies in which he made his move permanent but still struggled for game time for the most part did little to improve those prospects.",
      "But the 20-year-old has his feet firmly under the St James’ Park table now as a fully-fledged England international.",

      "",
      "9) Elliot Anderson (Newcastle to Nottingham Forest, £35m, July 2024)\nIt instinctively felt like an absurd fee but a few factors explained that final number beyond PSR-based cynicism.",
      "Anderson, a young and highly-rated player in a position Forest were openly desperate to reinforce, was on a long-term contract with a Premier League rival. And ultimately the back-scratching transfer of Odysseas Vlachodimos between the two clubs effectively offset about £20m of the valuation of a player on the England periphery.",
      "",
      "8) Omari Hutchinson (Ipswich Town to Nottingham Forest, £37.5m, August 2025)\nA year after joining Ipswich Town for a doomed year in the Premier League, the Tractor Boys almost doubled their money when Nottingham Forest came calling with a big pile of Anthony Elanga money. He has played for Jamaica but has since switched allegiances back to England, winning the Under-21 Euros in 2024.",
      "",
      "7) Morgan Gibbs-White (Wolves to Nottingham Forest, £25m to £44.5m, August 2022)\nIt feels as though a fair amount of those add-ons might well have been triggered by any of 18 goals, 28 assists, the avoidance of relegation, European qualification or England recognition.",
      "",
      "6) Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa to Newcastle United, £39m to £43m, August 2025)\nIt feels like a lot of money for a player who started just half of Aston Villa’s Premier League games the season before, but then you remember that West Ham paid £40m for…",
      "",
      "5) Max Kilman (Wolves to West Ham, £40m, July 2024)\nAn England international of 25 caps, but in futsal rather than association football. That actually prevented Kilman from making a proposed switch in allegiance to represent Ukraine from Euro 2021 onwards, leaving the Three Lions as his only route to playing for a country.",
      "His consistency for Wolves put him on the fringes of an England call-up and a £40m move to West Ham should theoretically have been the final push. But he doesn’t feel particularly close to breaking through under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "",
      "4) Anthony Gordon (Everton to Newcastle, £40m, January 2023)\nIt was assumed by many that Newcastle had taken leave of their entire senses when throwing as much as £45m at Everton for a forward with seven goals and eight assists in 78 games.",
      "Gordon already outstripped both before hitting that appearance mark at Newcastle, until Liverpool speculation left his ‘head in a mess’.",
      "This past season was a little slower for the Gordon bandwagon but someone had to make way for Jacob Murphy’s Ballon d’Or push.",
      "",
      "3) Cole Palmer (Manchester City to Chelsea, £40m to £42.5m, September 2023)\nIt is easy to forget just how ludicrous this move was at the time.",
      "It made absolutely no sense: Chelsea did not need yet another young, exciting forward and if Palmer was of the requisite quality, Manchester City would never have let him go.",
      "But Chelsea have thrown more than enough at the wall for some to stick and Palmer was the shoot of inspiration rather than yet another questionable deal. By the end of the year he had become their most important player and that responsibility only increased to the tune of an England debut, goal and place in their European Championship squad, as well as a goal in the final.",
      "Palmer had played just 41 games at senior level when Chelsea signed him for the rough equivalent of around £1m per career appearance. It has gone well.",
      "",
      "2) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, £45m to £50m, July 2019)\nCrystal Palace supporters probably felt that it was the usual show of big club bias from Southgate to not cap Wan-Bissaka, then call him up two months after he joined Manchester United. But the emergence of Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi and Adam Wharton proved Palace to be the former manager’s favourite club, and Wan-Bissaka remains as uncapped at Old Trafford as he ever was at Selhurst Park.",
      "He will have known that the England door closed long before he officially switched allegiance to DR Congo in May 2025. Wan-Bissaka is still yet to represent them after withdrawing from the June internationals due to ‘personal medical reasons’.",
      "",
      "1) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea, £48.5m to £52m, July 2025)\nIt was painfully obvious as far back as October 2024, when two Gittens goals in a Champions League defeat to Real Madrid prompted this line:",
      "‘Chelsea will almost certainly not be able to help themselves when it comes to a 20-year-old English forward with experience in the Manchester City academy set-up.’",
      "And so it came to pass that the Blues added to their burgeoning attacking ranks by spending some of their Club World Cup windfall on Gittens’ capture.",
      "All it took was “a couple of text messages” from Palmer and Delap “telling me to come” and join their legion of uncapped English talents.",
      "Man City have made an offer of £250m for Chelsea superstar Cole Palmer as they look to bring him back to the Etihad Stadium, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have been rejected by Real Madrid winger Rodrygo, while Arsenal have decided to ‘distance’ themselves from a deal, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak is ‘training alone’ amid uncertainty over his Newcastle, who have been dealt another huge blow as a second star ‘wants to join’ Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea have turned down a huge bid from Premier League rivals Man City as they look to re-sign Cole Palmer, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal will be signing one of three attacking options as their next transfer after a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is sealed, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly bracing themselves for an ‘improved offer’ from Bayern Munich for Luis Diaz with Anthony Gordon on their list of replacements."

Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

      "Sunday 17 August 2025 21:07, UK",
      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however unconvincing.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",
      "No other side has managed more than 20 in that timeframe.",
      "They are in a league of their own when it comes to set-pieces and they remain the Premier League's outstanding team defensively too.",
      "Even finishing 10 points behind Liverpool last season, they conceded seven goals fewer than any other side. This was just the latest example of their resilience and organisation under pressure.",
      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",
      "Their experience was tested, particularly in the first half as Manchester United's new signings Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha rampaged freely into space. But Arsenal responded.",
      "\"They really dug in,\" added Neville. \"They showed a lot of resilience. We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some great saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "\"It's hard to be strong when you have to push and go for the ball. Sometimes you are pushing and you don't have more hands to go for the ball.",
      "\"We need to be stronger in that moment, but we need to do the same thing in the opposite side. We have to adapt to the rules and today, it's hard to accept because we were the better team.\"",
      "More from Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim on Arsenal's winning goal:\n\n\n“You’re allowed to do a lot of things in the corner, we need to do the same. When you touch that way the goalkeeper he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not push players, or he chooses to push players and let the ball past.\n\n\n“It is the rules, it is allowed and we need to do the same thing. No (I’m not saying he should have acted differently), I am saying you choose to push a player or to get the ball. He chose to get the ball, but he’s getting pushed so he cannot defend it.\n\n\n“That is my feeling when I see the play but again, we need to do the same thing.”",
      "Amorim continued his defence of Bayindir and his goalkeepers in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"He suffered a goal like this where? Against Tottenham? It was without VAR. With VAR it was a foul,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Then in the next game against Arsenal, who saved the penalty? Who saved the game? You don't remember the game but I remember the game and Altay was unbelievable in that game. I considered everything to put in one or another and I chose Altay…",

      "Riccardo Calafiori's header saw Arsenal edge to a 1-0 win against Manchester United in their Premier League opener, despite Ruben Amorim's side looking much-improved going forward.",
      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",
      "Man Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Dorgu (7), Dalot (6), Casemiro (7), Mount (7), Fernandes (7), Cunha (8), Mbeumo (8).\n\n\nSubs: Amad (6), Ugarte (6), Sesko (6), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nArsenal: Raya (8), White (6), Saliba (7), Gabriel (7), Calafiori (7), Zubimendi (6), Rice (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (7), Martinelli (6), Gyokeres (6).\n\n\nSubs: Havertz (6), Madueke (6), Timber (6), Lewis-Skelly (6), Merino (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: David Raya.",
      "Gary Neville at Old Trafford: \"Arsenal really dug in. They showed a lot of resilience.",
      "\"We know how good they are defensively. The goalkeeper made some really good saves and the back four got better as the game went on.",
      "\"Arsenal were never at their best but to come to Manchester, whether it is Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, it's always tough. To get three points is big for Mikel Arteta.",
      "\"The Manchester United players look dejected. They are on the floor but if they keep up this level of performance, which is the big question, they will win a lot of points this season.",
      "\"I thought they did a fair few decent things out there but Arsenal were strong, and that set piece in the first half was the big difference in the game.\"",
      "\"Congratulations for the performance, but not congratulations [for the result] because we lost the game at home. We clearly deserved a different result and we need to move forward to the next one.",
      "\"We were more aggressive than last year, we sprinted more, we were braver, we went one against one for the whole game and we pressed high.",
      "\"With the ball, we have quality, even when the stadium makes some sound, we continued to play the way we play. We lost fewer balls in the build-up compared to last year, when we struggled a lot.",
      "\"Then the small things that we talk about in the beginning of this season when players like Cunha and Bryan can elevate the stadium in one moment. The most important thing - we weren't boring.",
      "\"We need to win games but that was a completely different game to last season.\"",
      "Roy Keane on Super Sunday: \"It's an important start for them [Arsenal] with the other teams doing so well over the weekend.",
      "\"It wasn't great in the second half, it lacked quality, especially from Arsenal's point of view, but you take the win on the first day of the season and move on.",
      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary said on commentary, everyone is okay with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better.",
      "\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.",
      "\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Manchester United.\"",
      "\"And we did it - one - because of the way we reacted to mistakes and - two - unfortunate mistakes and mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have, and we constantly reacted to that. And that's the reason why we had opportunity to win again.",
      "\"You're talking about character and spirit, that's it. I can make a mistake. How do I react to that? In open spaces, we should have killed them.",
      "\"The way everybody tried, the defence was phenomenal.\"",

      "Another Old Trafford defeat. But this wasn't same old Manchester United.",
      "There were shoots of hope in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "They played with sharp bursts of electricity and actually hurt the Gunners from different angles with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo maintaining their Premier League form of last season.",
      "Finally Ruben Amorim has players in central areas in attack that can cause chaos with their direct running and power.",
      "Cunha ranked top for dribbles (6) and duels (20) whilst everything Mbeumo did was very positive despite being tightly marked for most of the encounter.",
      "If they play like that at Old Trafford this season consistently, it could become a tough place for away teams to play. An expected goals tally of 1.59 suggests they were good for at least a goal. No points but a promising start.",
      "Something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "Nottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.",
      "Nuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. \"The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",
      "New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.",
      "Still, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.",
      "Nuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want?Laura Hunter",
      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game at Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",
      "A goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
      "If the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast.Laura Hunter",
