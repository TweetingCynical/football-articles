      "Rio Ferdinand has given his verdict(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has accused former Manchester United team-mates Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt of crossing the line by getting 'personal' in their criticism of Lisandro Martinez. The defender had been mocked by Scholes and Butt in the build-up to Saturday's Manchester derby.",
      "\"[Erling] Haaland would score, then throw him [Martinez] in the net,\" Scholes joked. Butt quipped: \"Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him, you know, when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler\".",
      "Martinez, 28, ended up keeping a clean sheet as United won 2-0, with Haaland's second-half substitution after an anonymous performance the icing on the cake. The Argentina international said post-match that he didn't 'care' about Scholes and Butt's comments, and invited them to his house to deal with the matter face-to-face.",
      "The pair responded, with Butt telling Martinez to 'grow the f*** up' on their podcast, The Good, The Bad & The Football. Scholes, who said that he'd previously exchanged messages with Martinez but hasn't heard anything since he gave him his phone number, added: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Now Ferdinand has weighed in on their comments. \"It's not beef, I think it's being made out to be beef,\" he began on Rio Ferdinand Presents. \"I think there has been this week some stuff that has probably been just over borderline, personal.",
      "\"I've spoken to Martinez a few times, face-to-face and online, and do you know what? He's someone who just wants to do well, he's someone who just wants to win, he's someone who just wants to get back to the standards that Man United were at.",
      "\"He's eager to understand what that looks like. He's even invited me to come into the training ground, to go for a coffee, whatever, just to sit.",
      "\"I think he's a sponge; he wants to work, he wants to learn. The way he plays, I feel, is the way he is, and he's an honest character and a good sort to have in the changing room it seems from what I hear from people around the place as well.",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have made headlines(Image: DARREN STAPLES/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"I think he's within his rights, if something's got on his nerves and he's come out and said it. The way it's been taken, I think, is probably a bit out of context.",
      "\"I don't think he's saying, 'Listen, come meet me anywhere and we'll have a tear up' - I think he's saying, 'Come on, let's have a conversation. Let's talk face-to-face, let's talk it out. If you've got an issue, let's talk about it'.",
      "\"I think he's straight as you like like that. Baring in mind, we're talking about a World Cup winner here, so he knows how to win. I had a conversation with him after the game and I think he was very just quick and clear: 'We've got a standard now, we need to gather momentum'.",
      "Lisandro Martinez did his talking on the pitch(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "\"For someone in their second language, he was spot on with what he's saying. He's always wanted to have conversations with people, he's always been open to that.",
      "\"What I would say is, I think when you're talking about people, as long as you feel you could say the same thing in front of them, and you'd be happy to say it in front of them with your chest out, then it's fair game.\"",

      "Brooklyn Beckham has finally addressed the long-suggested rift with his parents, David and Victoria, in a scathing six-page statement. And a decision once made by the 26-year-old provides an insight into his severed relationship with his father.",
      "It had long been suggested that Brooklyn and wife Nicola Peltz had become estranged from the iconic family on the back of their 2022 wedding. Neither Brooklyn nor Peltz attended Victoria's 50th birthday and both were absent as Manchester United and England icon David received a knighthood. Another 50th birthday faux pas and some social media blocking followed.",
      "On Monday, the footballer's son finally broke his silence, releasing a lengthy, volatile statement that included a string of accusations. Brooklyn claims his parents controlled most of his life, and his wedding was \"hijacked\" by his mother. He explained explicitly: \"I do not want to reconcile with my family.\"",
      "But earlier in his childhood, Brooklyn made the decision not to follow his father into football, and David's response says a lot about the amicable relationship the two once shared.",
      "At the age of 15, Brooklyn decided he would not emulate his father by becoming a professional footballer. Having been part of Arsenal's academy, he stepped away from football in 2014.",
      "Since then, Brooklyn has pursued a career in modelling as well as photography, but David admitted in a 2015 interview that it broke his heart to learn the reason why his eldest left the game.",
      "\"One of my boys turned around to me the other day and said, 'Daddy, I'm not sure I want to play football all the time,'\" he told ABC. \"It broke my heart a little bit.",
      "Brooklyn quit football at 15(Image: Getty)",
      "\"He said, 'Every time I went to the field, I know people are saying, This is David Beckham's son,' and if I am not as good as you, then it is not good enough.'\"",
      "This affectionate response was mirrored by Brooklyn in 2022 when he spoke to Variety. The United icon's son admitted he was \"sad\" to give up football but insisted his father just wanted him to be happy.",
      "\"My dad wasn't sad, because he was like, 'I just want you to be happy,'\" said Brooklyn. \"But of course, I was sad. It was my whole life since I was literally two.\"",
      "This father-son bond has now been well and truly detached on the back of Brooklyn's eruptive statement, in which he painted a very different picture of his father.",
      "Alongside other allegations, Brooklyn wrote: \"For my entire life, my parents have controlled narratives in the press about our family. The performative social media posts, family events and inauthentic relationships have been a fixture of the life I was born into.",
      "The 26-year-old renewed his vows with Peltz in 2025(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Recently, I have seen with my own eyes the lengths that they'll go through to place countless lies in the media, mostly at the expense of innocent people, to preserve their own facade. But I believe the truth always comes out.",
      "\"My parents have been trying endlessly to ruin my relationship since before my wedding, and it hasn't stopped. Weeks before our big day, my parents repeatedly pressured and attempted to bribe me into signing away the rights to my name, which would have affected me, my wife, and our future children.",
      "\"They were adamant on me signing before my wedding date because then the terms of the deal would be initiated. My holdout affected the payday, and they have never treated me the same since.\"",

      "Manchester United's interim manager Michael Carrick has implemented a new rule already(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick could reverse three bans that predecessor Ruben Amorim implemented at Manchester United before his sacking. Old Trafford legend Carrick took over from caretaker manager Darren Fletcher last week, stepping in as United’s interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "It came after Amorim was dismissed from his position as head coach 14 months into his tenure, having struggled to implement his tactical ideas effectively and seemingly fallen out with United’s director of football, Jason Wilcox, over transfers.",
      "Carrick in his first game in charge led the Red Devils to a dominant 2-0 win over Manchester City, with the performance reminiscent of the teams he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson. United appeared a completely different side after just three days of training under their new boss, notably defending with intensity and using wing-play to devastating effect.",
      "That may be thanks to a new rule Carrick quickly introduced after taking the reins. According to the Daily Mail, the 44-year-old has made training sessions at Carrington shorter but more intense in an effort to improve results this season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The response from the players is said to have been positive and it was 'immediately clear' from the first session that there was a different energy on the pitch. The squad were also introduced to the new coaching team, made up of Steve Holland - who arrived as Carrick's No.2 - along with Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans as first‑team coaches.",
      "There is said to be a strong blend of skill sets and personalities within the staff, and a 'positive dynamic' already appears to be forming. Training has also placed greater emphasis on individual work with specific players and the squad are thought to be impressed by the level of detail involved.",
      "It is unknown whether Carrick has scrapped the three bans previously implemented by Amorim when the Portuguese took charge or whether he has stuck with them. One of Amorim’s non-negotiables at United was the banning of players using international breaks as holiday opportunities, with Marcus Rashford and Casemiro notably drawing criticism for travelling across the Atlantic when they had only been given a few days off training to rest.",
      "Speaking about the incident, Amorim said: \"Would I set a different structure? Yes, for sure. But we cannot put this on the players. They told them they have five days off so they can fly anywhere. Because nobody in the club says you cannot fly. So we cannot, this time, put that on Rash or Case.",
      "Ruben Amorim's non-negotiables didn't bring success(Image: Nick Potts/PA Wire)",
      "\"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that. It’s my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "Amorim also banned food in the dressing room on matchdays, emphasising the need to improve his squad's physical fitness. Amorim admitted very early on it was \"impossible\" to win the Premier League with a team that doesn’t run.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won’t win,\" he said. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won’t win.\"",
      "Manchester United looked rejuvenated in Carrick's first game in charge(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The third rule he implemented was directed at his coaches, banning them from giving out complicated instructions to his players. The former Sporting CP boss believed that if he couldn’t explain a particular idea in a single sentence, it shouldn't be communicated until it's simplified.",
      "It was claimed that the approach initially went down well with the players, given the ‘clarity’ of his instructions. But that did not appear to help in practice as his players struggled to adapt to his 3-4-3 formation even after a year in charge.",
      "It seems the players have had no such issue with taking Carrick’s instructions on board, however, given their impressive display in the Manchester Derby. They will face an even tougher test with a trip to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, where they will face league leaders Arsenal.",

Newcastle, we probably don't think it from the outside, but when you're inside Newcastle and you live in that city, that is just a constant thing and he handles it brilliantly.",

      "However, United haven't opted to add just yet, though there is still more than 10 days for the Reds to change that. Despite their inactivity in the transfer window, Michael Carrick's side continue to be linked with signing several players, with a central midfielder thought to be at the top of their shortlist.",

      "Casado, 22, emerged from Barca's infamous La Masia academy to make his senior breakthrough in 2022 and has since gone on to make 60 appearances in all competitions for the Catalan side.",
      "However, Casado has struggled for regular game time at Barca, starting just 10 La Liga matches this season. There is mounting speculation that he could therefore leave in pursuit of more minutes.",
      "It's claimed that Casado had been reluctant to even consider offers to move from Barca, due to the fact his lifelong dream' is to be a first-team star at Camp Nou. But Atletico Madrid have identified Casado as a potential replacement for Conor Gallagher, who moved to Tottenham for £34million last week, while United are keen on a move. The 22-year-old is thought to be contemplating his future at Barca and might be open to an exit.",
      "United are said to have made an initial approach for Casado having 'closely monitored' him for some time.",

      "Rashford, 28, has spent the campaign on loan at Barcelona and has impressed, scoring eight goals and providing 11 assists in 29 appearances.

      "When quizzed on the current state of proceedings at United, Murphy told BOYLE Sports that Rashford should focus his attention on a new challenge away from United. He said: \"I don't think Michael Carrick, or whoever gets the job, will be able to influence the club to change their approach on Marcus Rashford.",

      "Saturday's Manchester derby was the first time that he had started a Premier League match since May. Mainoo also played 90 minutes for the first time since United's infamous Carabao Cup second round tie with Grimsby Town in late August.",
      "He came straight back into the squad under Darren Fletcher. Mainoo featured for the first time in weeks against Burnley.",
      "The midfielder then started against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup third round. Remaining in the team when they beat Manchester City meant consecutive starts for Mainoo.",
      "Between those two games under different interim coaches, it is understood Carrick told Mainoo he would be part of his plans for the rest of this season. That information came with an instruction to focus on re-establishing himself for his boyhood club and prove Amorim was wrong to sideline him.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "As such, Napoli can forget about any loan move for the midfielder this month. Weeks of Mainoo speaking with the Naples club will now come to nothing after his focus changed under Carrick.",
      "The club's former midfielder spoke highly of Mainoo before taking his new job. Carrick said in an interview with Rio Ferdinand last summer: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to [build the team around them]. United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",

      "Carrick explained: \"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom.",
      "\"I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit, but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and creating and taking the ball. I think he's got a massive future.",
      "\"I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get. He's got it, and he's shown that.",
      "\"It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you, and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",

      "Manchester United's interim manager Michael Carrick is coming off a valuable derby win(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United got the Michael Carrick era off to a perfect start on Saturday, beating Manchester City in their first league match under the interim boss. The 2-0 victory keeps alive United's hopes of Champions League qualification, something which would soften the blow of early eliminations from both domestic cups.",
      "The question now facing the club is whether they need to dip into the transfer market to cement their place in the upper echelons of the league. With no permanent managerial appointment until the summer, though, there may be a reluctance to spend too much.",
      "One thing which could end up forcing United's hand is other clubs rivalling them for targets. They spent north of £200m on new signings over the summer, with Bryan Mbeumo cementing his status as the most impressive of the bunch with his goal in Saturday's derby.",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford is set to lose one of his most experienced Barcelona team-mates. Marc-Andre ter Stegen has found himself in need of minutes if he wants to make Germany's World Cup squad and that isn't happening for him at Camp Nou.",
      "Ter Stegen returned from injury in December but has been unable to displace new first-choice keeper Joan Garcia. His only appearance this season came against CD Guadalajara in the Copa del Rey and he was reportedly offered to United before the turn of the year.",
      "Marc-Andre ter Stegen is on the move(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The 33-year-old has agreed an exit, though, and is due to join neighbours Girona on loan. According toSpanish outlet Sport (via Football Espana), the move could be agreed as soon as this week.",
      "The latest news comes after Barca saw their La Liga lead cut to one point after a defeat to Real Sociedad. Rashford came off the bench to briefly draw Hansi Flick's side level at Anoeta, just days after being warned there was no place for him in Flick's best starting XI.",
      "\"With Raphinha in that sort of form, it's going to be difficult for him to play too much football,\" Lineker said on The Rest is Football. \"But... [Barcelona] can see that he's doing really well and apparently they want to see if they can negotiate with Manchester United.\"",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta in action for Crystal Palace(Image: Richard Lee/Shutterstock)",
      "Juventus remain in talks over a move for Jean-Philippe Mateta as they look to win the race for the reported long-time Manchester United target. There are no early indications that the Premier League side will engage in a bidding war this month but the Turin club look determined to get a deal done sooner rather than later.",
      "According to reports in Italy, Juve are ready to return to the negotiating table after Crystal Palace knocked back an initial £26million bid. Italian and English sources have differing views on Palace's asking price, though it's thought to be £30m at a minimum.",
      "Napoli are also reported to be in the mix for the striker, who has scored 38 Premier League goals since the start of the 2023/24 season. His Palace contract expires in 2027 and it remains to be seen whether they cash in sooner.",
      "Palace are already coming to terms with the loss of another key player. Eagles captain Marc Guehi has joined Manchester City for less than the £40m the London club were hoping to bring in for a player who is out of contract this summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim's tenure at Manchester United lasted only 14 months(Image: Photo by Richard Pelham/Getty Images)",
      "Portuguese manager Ruben Amorim lasted only 14 months at the helm for Manchester United, with his time in the role ending shortly after he launched a verbal attack on United chiefs.",
      "For some fans, this dismissal came too soon, but ultimately his time was up at Old Trafford. There were similar, perhaps even stronger, feelings at Sporting Lisbon following the news Amorim was leaving the club to take on the United job. Sporting were on a very good run of form in Europe and were top of the domestic league in search of their third crown in just five years.",
      "Star player and captain Morten Hjulmand was gutted to see his manager leave for England but despite his exit, Sporting would go on to secure that all important third triumph in his absence.",
      "This is a stark contrast to his exit at United, where he left the role with the team in a bad run of form, before Michael Carrick stepped in and helped the team record a famous derby victory over Manchester City.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "Speaking to RTP via A Bola, Hjulmand spoke of the time Amorim left, making his feelings clear on the manager's exit from the Portuguese heavyweights.",
      "\"We thought that Amorim would stay for the season and fight to also be a two-time champion,\" explained the skipper. \"Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim, because he is a great coach.\"",
      "Whether he was betrayed, Hjulmand answered: \"That’s a very strong word. We feel disappointed with his departure. We were on a run of 11 consecutive wins, doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "\"Everything was very clear to everyone on the pitch. It was almost as if we were playing Playstation. Everyone knew what they had to do.",
      "Amorim left Sporting at an unfortunate time(Image: )",
      "\"I told him in front of the other players that we were disappointed with his departure. We were counting on him to help us all fight for the second title.",
      "\"He himself said the same thing at the start of the season. But afterwards, I also told Ruben that we understood his decision.\"",
      "On the manner in which he left the club, Amorim said: \"We started very well this season and then Manchester United came in for me. They paid above the amount set for my release clause and the president of Sporting CP defended the club's interests.",
      "\"I never argued about anything with the president regarding the negotiations. The only thing I asked during the process was that it take place at the end of the season.",
      "\"I spent three days asking for this, but I was told it wasn’t possible. It was now or never, otherwise they would look for another option. I had three days to decide something that radically changes my life.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have to take steps forward in my career and it was harder for me than any other Sportinguista to leave. I knew that if I rejected Manchester United, in seven months' time I wouldn’t have that option available, and I knew that at the end of the season I was going to leave Sporting CP.",
      "\"I could have felt a sense of regret that would be difficult to deal with. Between the disappointment of all Sportinguistas and taking risks in my career, or waiting for the end of the season and not having the only club that I wanted to join as an option, I had to decide. So I decided.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Michael Carrick after the win over Manchester City(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Ruben Amorim didn't deserve to be sacked according to some people. But in the space of one Manchester derby, Kobbie Mainoo proved that the Portuguese's dismissal was the right decision.",
      "Amorim, for whatever reason, decided to neglect one of the best young midfielders in English football during his time at Manchester United. He saw him as a deputy for Bruno Fernandes - who doesn't need one because if he's fit, he plays - and nothing else.",
      "His decision felt bizarre and criminal in equal measure. And in the end, it became self defeating, because Amorim no longer has a job at Old Trafford. Of course, Mainoo does.",
      "Amorim's treatment of Mainoo - who had risen to prominence under Erik ten Hag to the extent that he was promptly promoted into England's senior squad for Euro 2024 - left the boyhood United fan disillusioned and wanting to leave.",
      "Imagine that. Wanting to leave your hometown club, the one you supported as a child, the one which scouted you at the age of six and signed you at the age of seven.",
      "Mainoo had spent the last few weeks speaking to Napoli. He, like the rest of the world, hadn't failed to notice how former team-mate Scott McTominay has taken his game to new levels with the Italian champions, under the guidance of Antonio Conte. He was keen to do the same for himself.",
      "With Amorim ruining his season, he know his chances of being named in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup this summer were getting worse by the day.",
      "However, the Serie A side can forget about signing Mainoo now. He has forgotten all about moving to the Amalfi coast. His focus is back on the club of his heart, and thriving at home once more.",
      "Mainoo reminded everyone what a top class player he is during United's destruction of Manchester City at Old Trafford on Saturday. He was the epitome of composure and class in a high-octane game, again looking like the player who held United together at times in his breakthrough season and started for the Three Lions in the final of Euro 2024.",
      "He was the outstanding midfielder on the pitch, one which included Fernandes and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. So good was Mainoo, Rodri was insignificant from start to finish.",
      "And all of this in his first league start of the season.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo looks reborn following the sacking of Ruben Amorim (Image: Neal Simpson/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "It's understood Michael Carrick spoke to Mainoo after being appointed as interim manager, telling him that he would be a part of his plans between now and the end of the season.",
      "Telling him to focus on re-establishing himself in the United team.",
      "And telling him to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Within 90-plus minutes, he has done just that.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness cost Mainoo half a season. He can't get that back and it might be too late for him to impress Tuchel enough to take him to USA this summer.",
      "However, at a time when United are in serious need of some more genuine quality in midfield - but seem unwilling to send the money to get it - the fallen giants will feel like a new signing has arrived shown up again.",
      "Mainoo does not turn 21 until April. He has a long, potentially brilliant, career ahead of him. And United should make sure the bulk of it is with them - whatever happens in the dugout.",

      "Raheem Sterling has not played this season at Chelsea(Image: OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Chelsea may have changed the man in the dugout, but they haven't changed their feelings towards Raheem Sterling as of yet.",
      "The winger has endured a miserable spell since signing from Manchester City in 2022 and was frozen out under Enzo Maresca. Liam Rosenior is now in the hotseat and he's already admitted he will need to have a discussion with the Englishman sooner rather than later.",
      "Sterling's form at Stamford Bridge has not justified a recall and the quality available to Rosenior means there is no guarantee that Sterling would even get into the starting XI, but clarity is needed on both sides.",
      "The winger has Napoli weighing up a move, according to Sky in Italy, but the player himself would rather stay in England where his family are settled. Sterling was once among the Premier League's top performers, excelling under the guidance of Pep Guardiola in Manchester.",
      "With England he was a shining light, scoring match winners at Euro 2020. Now he's nowhere near the Three Lions picture, he's nowhere near the Chelsea picture. A fresh start may be beneficial for all involved, even if it means making some difficult decisions.",
      "Sterling is one of a number of players who turned out that night at Wembley against Italy, coming agonisingly close to ending the country's wait for a major trophy. Some of their age profiles would suggest they are approaching, or would be in, the absolute peaks of their careers. Instead, just getting onto the pitch is hard for some.",
      "Kalvin Phillips has just turned 30. The midfielder was a mainstay alongside Declan Rice during that tournament, all whilst becoming an iconic figure at Leeds. He was named England's Player of the Year in 2021. His rise was such that he was faced with a decision - stay with Leeds or challenge himself at City.",
      "Kalvin Phillips was on top of the world during Euro 2020(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He made the move, but taking on Rodri at the base of Guardiola's midfield was always going to be a daunting task. And so a player who looked so at ease in the final of a Euros is now in danger of becoming a forgotten man. Loan spells at West Ham and Ipswich have done little to reignite his career.",
      "Phillips has more than two years left on his contract in Manchester but is another man who must think that the Euro 2020 final feels like a lifetime ago.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho both appeared from the bench that night with their contributions in the penalty shootout well documented. The two men are showing that loan moves can have very differing outcomes with Manchester United needing to decide what to do with them.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford are both likely to depart Old Trafford(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Sancho had signed for the Red Devils 10 days prior to that Euros final. He arrived off the back of several stunning years in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, where goals and assists were weekly occurrences. At Manchester they have eluded him and he's been sent back to the Bundesliga, out to Chelsea and now is playing a squad role at Aston Villa.",
      "England never saw the player Dortmund did - and neither did Old Trafford. At 25 he has a decade at the top if he can ever rediscover his top form, but that will certainly be away from United after a £70million move that failed to work out.",
      "Rashford's future equally lies away from Manchester. That was a decision taken by Ruben Amorim, but one the club look to have stuck by even after his exit. The danger for United is that their academy graduate goes on to be a huge hit elsewhere, possibly Barcelona. His form in Spain currently means that a spot in England's World Cup squad this summer is not out of the question.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer always spoke highly of Amad Diallo(Image: Photo by Kacper Pempel - Pool/Getty Images)",
      "When Manchester United spent £37million on 18-year-old Ivorian winger Amad Diallo from Atalanta, it's fair to say there were a few raised eyebrows around Old Trafford.",
      "\"It is not for me to pick them apart publicly. We wanted to play to our strengths. The two wide lads, Amad and Dorgu, were fantastic both ways.\"",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney, like Carrick, also praised the work rate of Dorgu and Amad over the weekend. He said: \"I thought Amad and Dorgu on the wings were excellent, the work rate they put in to help the full-backs out and they got into a compact shape, which I spoke about, and hit Man City on the break.\"",
      "Like Carrick and Rooney, former boss Solskjaer also thinks highly of Amad. During his time at United, Solskjaer had targeted Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo, all of whom would walk into the current United side, but one player he did get his hands on was Amad.",
      "Solskjaer tipped Amad for a bright future from the very beginning, shortly after signing him. \"As a club, we have followed Amad for a number of years, and having watched him myself, I believe he is one of the most exciting young prospects in the game,\" he said.",
      "\"Manchester United has such a proud history of developing young players and everything is in place to enable Amad to reach his potential here.",
      "\"It will take time for him to adapt but his speed, vision and fantastic dribbling ability will stand him in good stead to make the transition. He is a player with all of the raw attributes that are needed to be an important player for Manchester United in the years to come.\"",
      "Amad Diallo has been a solid player for Manchester United(Image: Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Amad is also a player that Carrick has previously praised at United. During his other spell as United caretaker in late 2021, the 44-year-old worked with the winger for the first time.",
      "Then, when Amad was on loan at Sunderland and Carrick in the hot seat for Middlesbrough, Amad scored the decisive second goal in the 2-0 win and earned praise from Carrick afterwards.",
      "\"He does what he does,\" said Carrick at the time. \"He's really talented, Amad. Good in tight spaces and does what he does with the ball.",
      "\"For the goal, that's what he brings and I think that's what he's maybe brought a bit more is his end product from when I knew him when he was a little bit younger a couple of years ago. He's doing really well.",
      "Further praise saw Carrick brand him a \"terrific footballer\" and observed that the winger had \"jumped a level again\"",
      "Amad also thinks highly of Carrick, too, noting the importance of donning the ex-England international's jersey. He said: \"When I was told that I was getting the No. 16 shirt, I was happy because I know that Michael Carrick had previously worn that shirt for a long time and so it is a number worn by a legend of the club. So I have to respect the number and the players who wore it before me.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford found the net as Barcelona succumbed to defeat against Real Sociedad on Sunday. The Manchester United loanee was introduced just past the hour mark in the 2-1 loss.",
      "The English ace joined the Catalan giants in the summer of 2025, having lost his place under then-United manager Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. He made a blistering start, but in recent weeks his involvement in the team has diminished with key player Raphinha recovering from injury.",
      "Barcelona's Brazilian talisman was missing on Sunday when Rashford's side faced Real Sociedad away from home, but Fermin Lopez was chosen on the left wing from the start. The hosts took the lead after 32 minutes and Barcelona were struggling to break them down despite creating excellent chances.",
      "In the 62nd minute, Rashford was brought on by manager Hansi Flick and made an immediate impression. He nodded home a leveller less than 10 minutes later. Though Real Sociedad would exploit a defensive mistake and grab a decisive winner shortly afterwards, Rashford's contributions were praised by the Spanish press, with one outlet discussing the 28-year-old's future.",
      "Barcelona controlled Real Sociedad on Sunday, registering an impressive 23 attempts compared to their opponents' five. But despite crafting numerous opportunities, it was only Rashford who managed to breach the hosts' goal.",
      "Marca were fairly restrained in their post-match assessment of Rashford and noted: \"He came on in the 62nd minute. Seven minutes later, he opened the scoring with a pass from Lamine [Yamal]. He also hit the post.\"",
      "However, it was prior to kick-off that Marca opted to discuss the prospect of Rashford making his Barcelona stint permanent. They continued: \"There are two players the club are already counting on and wants to secure for the future. One of them is Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford bagged his side's only goal in the defeat(Image: Getty)",
      "\"The club are satisfied with his performance and the plan is to exercise the purchase option they have in place for £26million at the end of the season.\"",
      "Rashford delivered a statement with his strike in the 2-1 defeat, demonstrating he remains a crucial player for Flick's team and boosting the likelihood that Marca's assertion about a summer move will materialise.",
      "The Catalan giants struck the frame of the goal an incredible five times on Sunday night in a defeat that meant they lost ground in the race for the La Liga crown. Real Madrid now trail by just one point.",
      "Mundo Deportivo, nevertheless, highlighted Rashford for his impact from the substitutes' bench against Real Sociedad and stated: \"He was the only Barcelona player to put the ball in the back of the net and make it count.",
      "\"When Rashford and [Robert] Lewandowski entered the pitch, the onslaught intensified. Playing like this, Barcelona will score goals and string together more victories.\"",
      "Barcelona missed endless chances on Sunday(Image: Getty)",
      "The Barcelona dominance was also highlighted by AS, who like most other publications, were swift to focus on Rashford, who was the sole player capable of breaching the Real Sociedad defence amidst the bombardment.",
      "\"There's a raw beauty in winning when your opponent dominates you, at least in the first half and the beginning of the second,\" they penned. \"Barcelona controlled the football, while Real Sociedad provided the heart and the command.",
      "\"Flick made substitutions, bringing on [Joao] Cancelo, Rashford, and Lewandowski, more in an attempt to change the game than to improve the performance. Barca finally broke down the wall thanks to another gift from Lamine Yamal, which Rashford headed home.\"",
      "The Englishman sent a message with his header(Image: Getty)",
      "Sport were equally generous in their praise of Rashford's display and noted that he could have secured a double in second-half stoppage time had it not been for another strike of the woodwork. Such widespread acclaim also bodes well for Rashford's potential permanent transfer.",
      "\"He kept hopes of getting points at Anoeta alive with a winning header and sent a cross against the post,\" Sport reported. \"He created everything he could, but it wasn't enough.",
      "\"Misfortune left Barcelona's 25 attempts largely barren, whilst Real Sociedad made the most of their far more limited attacking chances. The final opportunity fell to England's Rashford, who almost sealed his double in the 93rd minute, but it failed to come to fruition.\"",

      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",

      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.",
      "\"I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once. Now it happens twice in six or seven months. That's just where we are now.\"",
      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have sold Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January(Image: )",
      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Dorgu scored another important goal in the Manchester derby.(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "In November, Patrick Dorgu milled about Carrington's second floor to fulfil a sponsorship duty. He was yards away from the press conference room, blissfully unaware that his manager had just knifed him.",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" said Amorim. The bruising quote was splashed on back pages and spread like wildfire on social media.",
      "Amorim had explained Manchester United were conceding too many goals because his players were \"really soft.\" That was the standout line of the press conference until an innocuous last question about Dorgu.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When Amorim was sacked at the beginning of the month, his ruthless comment about Dorgu was cited by United sources, who admitted that senior club figures had been unhappy with it.",
      "Amorim's forthright nature was brilliant for journalists, who were guaranteed a headline when he spoke, but less so for the people who mattered. The 40-year-old had a sharp tongue and was not afraid to speak his mind, which eventually led to talking himself out of a job after a final bombshell at Elland Road.",
      "Dorgu was still among the players who wished Amorim well after his sacking was confirmed. \"Thank you for everything, Mister. All the best in the future,\" he posted in an Instagram story.",
      "The message spoke volumes about Dorgu's maturity - and there are further examples. Last season, United were awarded a penalty against Real Sociedad in the Europa League, but Dorgu tried to overturn the decision himself with the referee while it was checked by VAR because he hadn't been fouled.",
      "During the recent 2-2 draw against Burnley at Turf Moor, Dorgu just got on with it after being stamped on by Kyle Walker, when performing theatrics would have seen Walker sent off.",
      "Dorgu has character and demonstrated steeliness to shake off Amorim's criticism in November, which might have caused greater harm to a 21-year-old without the same mental fortitude.",
      "Dorgu has responded to Amorim's criticism.(Image: 2026 Simon Stacpoole/Offside)",
      "Instead of sulking, Dorgu has trained to prove Amorim wrong. A source said the Dane \"does loads of extras\" and credited him for working \"really hard\". It's understood there has been a focus on improving Dorgu's crosses, with an emphasis on him perfecting his technique during training at Carrington.",
      "United believe Dorgu's hard work is paying off. The Denmark international knew an opportunity to regain his starting role would emerge during the Africa Cup of Nations, and he's contributed two goals and two assists in six games, representing his hottest run of form yet since his transfer from Lecce.",
      "Dorgu provided a brilliant assist for Matheus Cunha at Villa Park, and he built on that performance by scoring a superb volley in a gritty 1-0 victory against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "Following the Newcastle victory, he spoke to reporters and was asked how he dealt with Amorim's criticism, saying: \"Of course, it's never nice to get criticism, but you will always get it as a player. And you need to react well to it, and I think I've reacted well in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Dorgu added: \"The manager spoke about my confidence, so I just looked inside and tried to understand what he meant. And I just tried to build myself up. My teammates help me as well.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes, along with other members of United's senior leadership group, spoke to Dorgu after Amorim's press conference comment and he received support from the players he is closest to in the United dressing room - Ayden Heaven, Leny Yoro and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Dorgu and Hojlund pictured at Carrington in July.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Dorgu should feel more secure at Old Trafford after an encouraging month. There were growing doubts about whether he was cut out for United, but he has shown his mettle by delivering improved performances.",
      "He has looked at home playing on the wing, which started against Newcastle when Amorim played him on the flank. Newcastle's analysts in the press box were audibly confused at the start of the game, trying to work out where Dorgu was playing, and he popped up with the matchwinner.",
      "But Dorgu's recent performances on the wing may even surprise the data boffins who recommended his transfer from Lecce, as he has taken to the role like a duck to water.",
      "(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "It helps that Dorgu briefly played on the wing for Lecce, but performing in the Premier League is a different kettle of fish. He is learning on the job at one of the most scrutinised institutions in the world, and it shouldn't be forgotten that he's only just turned 21.",
      "Dorgu's goal against Manchester City was further evidence of his progress. He was picked to start in a striker-less front free by Michael Carrick, who preferred him to Cunha, and he vindicated that selection.",
      "\"I think Cunha did the hard work,\" Dorgu modestly told MUTV about his goal. “I just believed in my teammate that he would put a good ball in there, and I just closed my eyes and hoped to win.”",
      "Dorgu has gradually found his feet in Manchester, settling in the city without family joining him. Throughout the summer, staff noticed a difference in him, noting his confidence had grown after a challenging first few months at the club, in which United finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "\"I think I learned a lot,\" said Dorgu of last season. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season.\"",
      "Dorgu's confidence should receive another boost after his Manchester derby goal. He does not look very anxious any more.",

      "The Argentina defender responded to claims made by Butt and Scholes, before the Manchester derby, as United down their rivals 2-0 on Saturday. Now, Ferdinand has accused his former teammates of making personal remarks during their analysis of the United stopper.",
      "Martinez played a key role in the triumph as Michael Carrick earned his first in interim charge at Old Trafford. The former Ajax defender nullified City's threat and limited Erling Haaland to little success in forward positions.",
      "The defender's standout display came amid the backdrop of pessimism from former United players. United were winless since their Boxing Day triumph over Newcastle United, and after their struggles under Darren Fletcher, following Ruben Amorim's sacking, there was trepidation ahead of the visit from Pep Guardiola's side.",

      "Ferdinand said: \"It's not beef, I think it's being made out to be beef. This week I think there has been some stuff that has probably been just over borderline, personal.",
      "\"I have spoken to Martinez a few times, online and in person, and he is someone who just wants to do well, win, get back to the standards Man United were at. He is eager to see that that looks like.",
      "\"He has even invited me to go to the training ground, go and get a coffee - he is a sponge. The way he plays is the way I feel he is - he is an honest character and a good sort to have in the changing room.",
      "\"He is within his rights, if something gets on his nerves... he has come out and said it. The way it has been taken I think needs some context. He is not saying, 'Come and meet me anywhere and we will have a tear up'\" - he is saying, 'Let's have a conversation face to face is you have an issue'.",
      "\"We are talking about a World Cup winner here, he knows how to win. I had a conversation with him after the game and he was quick and clear - we have a standard now and need momentum. What I would say is, when you are talking about people, if you feel you can say the same thing in front of them, then it is fair game.\"",
      "Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt criticised Lisandro Martinez(Image: Photo by Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Martinez returned from a serious knee injury earlier this season and has provided much-needed reinforcement at the back during their injury troubles. He didn't mince his words responding to Scholes after the win at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I respect when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see (them) here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.\"",
      "Scholes' response was more tongue-in-cheek, he said: \"Someone’s had a good game, was really happy for you … tea, no sugar pls.\"",
      "Butt's was a lot firmer in his response and argued there is no personal vendetta behind his remarks. The 50-year-old said: 'He was brilliant on the day. Fair play to him.",
      "\"For me, we talk like lads having a conversation. It's tongue in cheek. It's f***ing obvious. I think when people get so upset about someone in the media or on a podcast... saying all that, it's like, f***ing grow up.",
      "\"If you're going to get so emotional about someone saying something about you, you shouldn't be at a football club, because he is going to get that for the rest of his career at Man United. There is no personal issue.\"",

      "The former midfielder is expected to depart at the end of the season, with the club to appoint a permanent head coach. However, the win over City has already kick-started talk over Carrick getting the job on a full-time basis.",

      "Speaking on Howe, he said: “I’m a huge fan of Eddie Howe. I think the type of football that you see from Newcastle at their best - high energy, pressing and in the future - that’s not just Manchester United, that’s a lot of top clubs and how they want to play.",
      "\"The real big thing I like about Eddie Howe is how he handles the press, you’ve got to be able to handle the press as a Man United manager, it’s the club that’s on the back pages more than any other club in this country. Newcastle, we probably don’t think it from the outside, but when you’re inside Newcastle and you live in that city, that is just a constant thing and he handles it brilliantly.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "There has been a lot of talk over a potential takeover at Manchester United over the last few years.",
      "The Glazer family have owned United since June 2005, but amid the team’s struggles over the last few years there has been growing fan unrest towards the ownership. There is a protest planned ahead of the Premier League game against Fulham at the start of next month.",
      "The Glazers sold a minority stake of the club to Sir Jim Ratcliffe almost two years ago. However, against Burnley last week a banner criticising the co-owner was held up in the away end at Turf Moor when United took on Scott Parker's side in the Premier League, just days after the dismissal of manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speculation over a potential takeover started again back in October last year when Saudi sports promoter Turki Al-Sheikh suggested a deal was imminent with posts on social media. Any potential move failed to come to fruition.",
      "There is still, however, talk of potential investment at Old Trafford as plans for the future are put in place. With that in mind, here is a look at the latest.",

      "Former chief executive of Premier League clubs Keith Wyness has shared a theory over investment plans for Manchester United. He believes that the club will need additional income to help fund the plans to build a new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, he said: \"I've got no doubt there are discussions, and it's the Glazers that hold the key at the moment, and I've got no doubt discussions have happened about the Glazers either bringing in another partner or selling it in some position, and I think Ratcliffe would have little choice on that.",
      "\"See the big ramifications of the problems that INEOS have brought on themselves now is things like the debt pile that's still there in his own company, which means that they will not be able to finance through INEOS or give the proper guarantees, possibly for things like the stadium.",
      "\"Now that's a big long-term project that all the fans were told to buy into. If you like, it was the showpiece of the whole INEOS tenure, that they wanted to show that we’re going to be moving forward and the great new Old Trafford project was going to be born and with the circus tent.",
      "\"And it was impressive, but I’m just wondering now how that could be financed in the same way without bringing in outside finance in a more expensive way and that’s going to put more pressure on them.\"",
      "If the Glazers do decide to sell the company, then a ‘drag along rights’ clause in the agreement when the minority stake was sold to Ratcliffe would become active. It basically puts a timeline on any full sale of the club.",
      "As reported by the Athletic, if the Glazers wanted to fully sell the club before February next year, then the price of Ratcliffe’s share would have to be above the $33 million (£24.5m) that he paid.",
      "However, after that date, the Glazers can accept any price they want and Ratcliffe would be ‘dragged along’ with the sale, even if it loses him money.",
      "Man United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed a purchase of a minority share around two years ago. (Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Back in 2023, the Glazers were in takeover talks with Qatari billionaire Sheikh Jassim, with the company Nine Two Foundation set up to complete the takeover.",
      "A statement at the time read: \"Sheikh Jassim Bin Hamad Al Thani today [Friday February 17] confirmed his submission of a bid for 100 per cent of Manchester United Football Club.",
      "\"The bid plans to return the club to its former glories both on and off the pitch, and - above all - will seek to place the fans at the heart of Manchester United Football Club once more.",
      "\"The bid will be completely debt free via Sheikh Jassim's Nine Two Foundation, which will look to invest in the football teams, the training centre, the stadium and wider infrastructure, the fan experience and the communities the club supports.",
      "\"The vision of the bid is for Manchester United Football Club to be renowned for footballing excellence, and regarded as the greatest football club in the world.",
      "\"More details of the bid will be released, when appropriate, if and when the bid process develops.\"",
      "Nothing ever came of the bid, with the Glazers instead opting to sell a minority share to Ratcliffe. It seems that Jassim has now given up on completing a takeover through the company.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is making a similar impact to Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "The debate over Manchester United's best signing since the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era is a short one. Bruno Fernandes stands head and shoulders above the rest in just about every category imaginable.",
      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "The 22 year old Casado emerged from Barca's renowned La Masia academy to achieve his senior breakthrough in 2022 and has subsequently accumulated 60 appearances across all competitions for the Catalan club. Nevertheless, Casado has found regular playing time hard to come by at Barca, with only 10 La Liga starts this season.",

      "Some United supporters would welcome Rashford's return after his stint in Spain - but Murphy believes such a scenario is impossible.",
      "When questioned about the current situation at United, Murphy told BOYLE Sports that Rashford should concentrate on pursuing a fresh opportunity elsewhere. He said: \"I don't think Michael Carrick, or whoever gets the job, will be able to influence the club to change their approach on Marcus Rashford.",
      "\"I think he's had his chances and opportunities. Also, the fanbase has generally turned on him a little bit. I think he's too far gone. Even if he doesn't get the Barcelona move, a move somewhere else will benefit him.",
      "\"He looks like he's playing with freedom. I even saw him come off the bench against Real Madrid, and he looked so sharp, expressing himself and appearing like a different player.",
      "\"I think his days at United are over, regardless of who is in charge.\"",

      "United sources have confirmed Zirkzee's absence was due to a knock he suffered against Brighton. The 24-year-old was captured telling a fan outside Old Trafford that he would be sidelined for \"two weeks\", and it remains to be seen whether the issue affects his future in the final two weeks of the January window.",

      "Guardiola shakes hands with Carrick.(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "\"Think forward, play forward, run forward\" has been the message drilled into Manchester United's academy players across decades. It's a mindset that has been the foundation for success at the football club. On Saturday, Michael Carrick went back to basics against Manchester City to help his team produce United's finest Manchester derby performance since the 2024 FA Cup final triumph.",
      "United looked like a proper United team, limiting City to just one shot on target and having three goals disallowed for offside in a dominant 2-0 victory. It was goalless at half-time, but the home players were applauded back into the dressing room. United's fans finally recognised what they were watching.",
      "\"So different, so different,\" Lisandro Martienz told reporters when asked about Carrick's impact in training. United were aggressive, they played on the front foot, their attitude and mentality were different.",
      "Just 54 days before the Manchester derby, United limped to a humiliating 1-0 defeat to a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The difference between the two performances is chalk and cheese.",
      "Martinez's answer about Carrick's impact spoke volumes about what he and his backroom staff achieved in three days, but it also reflected badly on Ruben Amorim. United were unshackled against City, and the performance was total vindication of the decision to axe Amorim and appoint Carrick.",
      "Mbeumo celebrates after scoring in the derby.(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "Amorim secured a few memorable victories during his season-and-a-half in charge at United, with wins against City at the Etihad and against Lyon at Old Trafford the pick of a limited bunch.",
      "However, those results were secured thanks to brilliance from individuals. Amad was responsible for single-handedly turning the derby on its head in December 2024, while Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire miraculously scored late goals against Lyon. United could have easily lost both of those matches.",
      "On this occasion, United were collectively outstanding against City, and it was impossible to argue that it was a fluke. City suffered their biggest expected goals (xG) defeat in their history, which confirmed the visual impression: United were rampant and thoroughly deserved their 2-0 win.",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is that Man United were better than Man City. You have to accept it,\" said a disappointed Guardiola during his post-match press conference.",
      "Carrick outfoxed the greatest manager in the Premier League after seven months out of the game. \"We've got season tickets and my family comes, so I've been to a lot of games over recent times and you get to know the players and your own eye,\" said Carrick after the game.",
      "\"Everyone has an opinion and your instincts, and then there was a few days to prepare, so the balance of how much information, what the lads could take on, being fair to them to not overdo it.\"",
      "The debate throughout Amorim's tenure was whether United would improve by playing a different formation. A big part of that was Amorim's system forced Bruno Fernandes to play in a deeper role.",
      "Fernandes was relocated to his strongest position by Carrick and, unsurprisingly, delivered a superb display. \"I've spoken to Bruno, I've known him a long time now, and I thought he was fantastic today,\" said Carrick. \"The way he played the position, he's so clever, and he takes up space.\"",
      "Fernandes is playing in his best position again. (Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Carrick's team selection was perfect. Harry Maguire was recalled and was superb alongside Martinez, while Kobbie Mainoo sparkled on his first start of the Premier League season.",
      "It was a big decision to name Benjamin Sesko on the bench given he'd scored three goals in his last two matches, but a striker-less attack of Patrick Dorgu, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad was the right choice. Carrick was spotted with his arm around Sesko during the post-match celebrations.",
      "The tactics were executed perfectly. United operated with a 4-4-2 shape at times, and they played narrow, giving City's wingers yards of space by the byline. However, when the ball was played to those wingers, Diogo Dalot or Luke Shaw would sprint out - and the forward ahead of them would drop back.",
      "Guardiola's side were unable to play inside from their wingers toward United's box, which is how they score plenty of goals in the Premier League, because of Carrick's tactical instructions.",
      "The defensive organisation made a significant difference. Carrick added Steve Holland to his backroom staff, and the result was also a huge tactical win for the 55-year-old, who oversaw the bulk of the coaching in training during Gareth Southgate's tenure as England manager.",
      "Holland arrived with bags of experience, having previously spent years advising successful managers at Chelsea. Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were key in the victory as well.",
      "Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece on the touchline. Binnion was sitting behind the press box, passing down information to the bench from the advantage of a bird's eye view.",
      "Carrick hopes United can continue to soar during the remainder of the season.",

      "Lisandro Martinez has been told to grow the f**k up by Nicky Butt as his war of words with the Manchester United defender continued. Following his side’s 2-0 Manchester derby win, the Argentine hit back at comments made by Butt and Paul Scholes after they mocked his size ahead of his battle with Erling Haaland.",
      "Butt joked that the City forward “would pick Martinez up and run with him” like a “dad after school running down the road with a little toddler” before Scholes laughed and said that “he’d score then throw him in the net”. But Martinez and his team-mates managed to keep the Norway international so quiet that Pep Guardiola brought him off with ten minutes of normal time remaining.",
      "Martinez’s comments prompted a swift response from Scholes, who wrote on Instagram on Sunday: “Someone’s had a good game, was really happy for you … tea, no sugar pls.” And in his response, Butt not only told the defender to \"f*****g grow up\" but also warned him he shouldn't be at a club like United if he is going to react the way he did.",
      "\"First and foremost, he was brilliant on the day and fair play to him,\" he said on his The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast.",

      "“Him and Harry, to be fair, were brilliant, so we could come on here now and say brilliant well done. But that is what is expected from a Man United player on derby day.",

      "\"It is tongue in cheek, and it is quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It is f*****g obvious. It is a figure of speech.",

      "\"You get your ups and downs and I got so much crap when I played at Man United and Newcastle, but then next week you get your plaudits and you get clapped at. There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. None.\"",
      "Butt then later continued: \"He's telling us to come knock on his house. I'm f*cking 50 years of age; I'm not going knocking on someone's house saying, 'Can we have a chat?' It's just ridiculous. And, if you're going to get that precious, you better be sh*t hot every week.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Scholes also revealed that he had previously exchanged messages with Martinez on social media, in which the centre-back revealed he had lost all respect for him.",

      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a reckless early challenge on Jeremy Doku and then a poor pass straight out of play, but did well to recover his poise after that. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Should probably have scored early in the game but excellent defensively against Erling Haaland. A real front-foot performance. 8",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Superb sliding block on Haaland early in the second half. Read the game well and was good on the ball. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Booked in the early stages as well but coped well with Antoine Semenyo, who had Phil Foden in support in the first half. Intelligent performance. 7",
      "Casemiro: Should have scored, but excellent recovery tackle on Haaland after Kobbie Mainoo gave the ball away. A magnificent holding midfield performance. 9",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Lovely shimmy past Semenyo a reminder of his talents. A bit careless with a loose pass to Haaland in the second half but deserves a run in the team. 7",
      "Amad: A real livewire. Tormented Nathan Ake and then got Nico O'Reilly booked inside three minutes. Could have easily had a goal and was a threat throughout. Hit the post late on. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Unlucky with the narrowest of offside calls. A sublime pass to create a chance for Dorgu and perfect pass for the goal. Bruno at his best. 8",
      "Patrick Dorgu: A surprise selection but what an impact. Sharp on the ball, good first-half volley and really alert to get the second goal. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Exceptional work rate and clever movement to try and pull City's defenders out of position. Good volley to test Donnarumma and clinical with his next chance. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Made an impact at both ends of the pitch. Big tackle on the edge of his own area and assist for Dorgu's goal. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Little time to make an impact after coming on for the shattered Casemiro. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Thought he had scored late on but ruled out for offside. 7",
      "Ayden Heaven: A late introduction. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Malacia, J. Fletcher, Sesko",

      "Manchester United have been given an immediate verdict on Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku during Saturday afternoon's Manchester derby. Former Premier League referee Mike Dean believes United should have been reduced to 10 men in the first half against Manchester City.",
      "\"But when you see the replays, the replays aren't good; for me, that's a red card. I know they said don't go looking for things, but it's high, it's across the kneecap, it's a red card all day.\"",
      "At half‑time, Richards said: \"He's on top of his knee - that's the clearest red card you're going to see. I mean, what more do you want for a red card? Studs on the knee.\"",
      "Sturridge then added: \"That's not a glancing blow. That's like taking a knee in a boxing match - you've taken a good punch to the jaw. That to me there, looks like a red. If I'm Doku, I'm staying down. If he stays down longer... That's a red card.\"",
      "Keane then shared his own opinion, insisted: \"Well maybe, but obviously they've had a look at it, do you know what I mean? We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?",

      "The Premier League Match Centre identified the challenge as neither forceful nor intense.",
      "A tweet on X read: \"The referee's call of yellow card to Dalot for a reckless challenge was checked and confirmed by VAR - with the contact deemed to be glancing and not with excessive force.\"",
      "\"He is clearly looking for the ball, but Doku is too quick for him.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Unai Emery has foolishly been named Premier League Manager of the Month and then conducted a weird interview hinting at issues behind the Aston Villa scenes.",
      "That might not sound like a potent combination for a prompt sacking but in this particular season it is at least an inadvisable path to go down.",
      "Emery has followed an entirely doomed succession line of Premier League Manager of the Month award winners in 2025/26: Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim, Oliver Glasner and Arne Slot. And the two winners at the end of 2024/25 were Vitor Pereira and Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "In the cases of Maresca, Amorim and the entirely miserable Glasner especially they were crowned against a backdrop of hierarchical and boardroom issues which ultimately helped trigger their departures.",
      "So Emery saying Villa “are not contenders to be in the top five” and venting about “other teams with more potential than us” in a nod to Spurs hijacking their move for Conor Gallagher and Donyell Malen being sold before a replacement was secured, did not sit right with many.",
      "Jamie Redknapp called it “one of the oddest interviews I have ever seen”. Ashley Young thought it was “weird”. Stuart Pearce wondered “whether the frustration going forward will be too much for him that he can’t take this team any further”. Brooklyn Beckham was asked for comment but he’s got a lot going on.",
      "The likelihood of Emery actually leaving this season is infinitesimal; the bloke just wears his heart on his sleeve and was understandably slightly rattled by having to play David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "But in the unlikely event he does leave a post in which he holds an unimaginable amount of power and leeway, Emery would not be the first Premier League Manager of the Month to resign or be sacked in the same season.",

      "That form soon turned and by the time Mourinho was sacked in April, Spurs were barely clinging to a qualification spot for the same Europa League that Dinamo Zagreb dumped them out of despite their coach being in prison at the time.",
      "Spurs tried to hit Mourinho where it hurts, cutting ties six days before the Carabao Cup final and preferring Ryan Mason to lead them out against Manchester City. But they underestimated the Portuguese, who just counts the trophy among his collection anyway.",

      "The newly promoted Baggies felt compelled to act after winning three of 16 Premier League games and slipping into a relegation battle that seemed to be comfortably in the rear-view mirror by September. A home draw with Tottenham, derby spoils in a 3-1 win over Birmingham and a dramatic 3-2 victory at Arsenal, combined with beating Manchester City in the League Cup, had helped dampen the disappointment of a six-goal opening-day thrashing at the hands of Chelsea.",

      "Few neutral, critics and even fans gave Hull City a tiger’s chance in the ocean of surviving as a Premier League team in their most recent top-flight season. Promotion had been secured through the play-offs but Steve Bruce left less than a month before the campaign began, the first team contained 13 senior players at one point and a protracted takeover looked no closer to being completed.",

      "September 2001 was particularly flattering as Liverpool, Southampton and Blackburn were swept aside, sandwiching a goalless draw with Sunderland. A Champions League tilt at least looked possible. But from November 3 to New Year’s Day they beat only Ipswich in 11 games and the damage was done when they surrendered a two-goal FA Cup third-round lead over United.",

      "Diogo Dalot drew headlines on Saturday after avoiding a red card for a studs-up challenge on Jeremy Doku in the Manchester derby. It was more attention than he’s received for anything he’s done at Manchester United for a long time. That’s meant more as a compliment than an insult.",
      "He’s rarely bad enough to draw criticism. He’s normally fine and being fine for Manchester United has been no mean feat in what has incredibly been his seven-and-a-half years at the football club. Only Luke Shaw (11-and-a-half years) has been at Old Trafford longer; Dalot is the 23rd longest-serving Premier League player.",
      "Signed under Jose Mourinho in 2018, he’s seen Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ruben Amorim come and go; he’s currently enjoying his second helping of Michael Carrick, who – like his predecessors – will presumably find Dalot to be a consummate professional and a safe pair of boots.",
      "There’s a lot to be said for those consistent 6/10 players, particularly when the performances of the long, long list of Dalot’s United teammates past and present have been so variable. But there is also always the possibility that the grass may be greener, quite a lot greener as an alternative view is that his 232 appearances for the club symbolises the Red Devils’ post-Sir Alex Ferguson inadequacy.",
      "His apologists will claim he doesn’t get the credit he deserves, and that may be fair, but we’re also struggling to imagine too many Premier League managers chasing Dalot over the full-backs they currently have available to them. We doubt, for example, that Andoni Iraola would trade Dalot for Alex Jimenez.",
      "The 20-year-old joined Bournemouth from AC Milan on loan in the summer, but is now just four starts from meeting the 18-game requirement for that loan to be turned into a permanent £16m transfer at the end of the season.",
      "In 52 senior games for Milan and Bournemouth he’s yet to score a goal and has just three assists to his name, but as shown frequently in this clash with Brighton, he’s very adept at getting his team up the pitch with what is his outstanding speed and jinking acceleration with the ball at his feet. And while that final bit – the cross or shot – is currently lacking, his technical quality suggests those goal contributions will come in time.",
      "It was his bursting midfield run and crucial pass which set up Eli Junior Kroupi’s equaliser to make it 4-4 against Manchester United in December, and him playing on the right wing as he did on that day at Old Trafford, suggests Iraola – who it’s fair to say knows his onions – has no doubts over the right-back’s creativity.",
      "Nor will there be concern over his defensive faculties. Kauro Mitoma barely had sniff on the left for Brighton, though was forced to enjoy Jimenez screaming in his face after one instance of many in which the Bournemouth man got the better of him.",
      "Anyone watching him of late will be of a view that Jimenez is a star that’s yet to make the headlines that Dalot has avoided through his mediocrity.",
      "United managed to persuade both Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to join them over rivals in the summer, but in this saga of Red Devils transition, for every Champions League-ready star they are able to sign there will be another – like Antoine Semenyo – who opts to move to a better, more stable football club.",
      "As Ruben Amorim found out when he was denied the Semenyo money to spend on an alternative, United aren’t about to throw cash around willy-nilly as they once did, particularly when – as is the case with Dalot – the need for improvement isn’t all that conspicuous.",
      "But there is room for improvement and the best means for United to make gains would be for them to target unheralded players with high ceilings who may only marginally improve the first team when they arrive, but have the potential to make a huge difference in the not-too-distant future. Alex Jimenez is one of those players."

      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender gave a measured response – which he was asked for – to the pundit’s baseless criticism ahead of the Manchester derby. Excuse us for getting into a playground back and forth dear readers, but how about you f***ing grow up, mate.",
      "Rather than being “picked up and run with like a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler” by Erling Haaland, as Butt suggested would be the case, Martinez was the teacher waiting at the school gates to reprimand the father for his tardiness.",
      "It was a magnificent display from the Red Devils centre-back against the Premier League’s most dangerous striker; one Butt and fellow bullsh*t purveyor Paul Scholes might have predicted had their analysis of the battle involved more than a quick glance at their relative physiques.",
      "Saturday was Martinez’s fourth win in five meetings against Haaland and his second clean sheet. If there’s a criticism that can be aimed at the Argentinian it’s that there’s a rick in him. No-one is saying he’s a perfect centre-back; he makes mistakes too frequently to be hailed as a world class defender.",
      "But it’s very difficult to watch Martinez play a game of football and question his aggression, pace or physicality. Scholes’ suggestion that Haaland would “score, then throw him in the net” was also apropos of nothing. It was nonsense. Fiction for clicks.",
      "“He can say whatever he wants,” Martinez said. “I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don’t care.”",
      "Scholes accepted that invitation but, perhaps frustrated or embarrassed at being The Other Guy On The Podcast not even worthy of reference by the United star, Butt issued a nuclear and unbefitting response.",
      "“We are a podcast, we are three lads in a pub, we are not on Sky doing commentary. It’s quite obvious that Haaland is not going to pick him up and run with him. It’s f***ing obvious that.",
      "“When someone gets so upset about someone in the media or a podcast to start saying they can do what they want and come to my house and all that, f***ing grow up.",
      "“If you are going to get so emotional about someone saying that about you, you shouldn’t be at a big club. He will get that at the rest of his career at United, there will be ups and downs.",
      "“There is no personal issue with us and Martinez. I think it’s really sad that someone gets so upset.”",
      "We’re reticent to draw attention to it as there’s evidently nothing that Butt – at the start of his punditry career – wants more than for this to be dubbed a ‘war of words’. Martinez “doesn’t care” what Scholes thinks; he’s not about to give a sh*t about the thoughts of the guy alongside him. What is he? The podcast producer?",
      "But we were triggered by the obvious need for the man telling another man to grow up to grow up himself. There isn’t a person on earth who took Butt’s claim that Haaland would pick Martinez and run with him literally. It is indeed “f***ing obvious” and definitely not the reason Martinez was irritated, Nicky.",
      "Martinez, like every human being over the age of six knows how metaphors work. He’s annoyed by a) what the metaphor suggests and b) that suggestion being without foundation.",
      "And what’s this rubbish about “emotional” footballers not being suited to “big clubs”. Wasn’t Roy Keane your captain? Didn’t you watch Eric Cantona kung-fu kick a fan? You can’t just tell someone to grow up and expect to win the argument. He’ll be telling him to stop showing off in front of his friends in a minute.",
      "Butt and Scholes also can’t just brush off whatever they say on the basis of this being a podcast akin to “three lads (we would actively avoid) in a pub”. Well actually, they can, but a licence to say anything at all with no regard to facts, stats or simply what people see with their eyes makes it an entirely meaningless pursuit and one we can only hope that Martinez and the rest of the Manchester United players continue to treat with the disdain it deserves.",
      "Paul Scholes has revealed that Lisandro Martinez messaged him on Instragram recently claiming that he’d “lost all respect” for the Man Utd legend.",
      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender hit back at the pundit for mocking him on his podcast.",

      "Apprehensively waiting for the game to start on Saturday morning the last thing I expected to see just a few hours later was the Old Trafford faithful waving Haaland off the pitch as he was hooked after doing f*** all in derby. It was a brilliant day.",
      "If you look back on Manchester derby games since Fergie left United have done pretty well when considering the gulf between the two over that time. United have 12 wins to City’s 14 with 5 draws. So beating City isn’t unusual. You would also recognise some of the tactics employed by Carrick in previous wins against City. Low block, low possession, and a counter attacking threat were all on display.",
      "However, many of those previous United wins were either on a knife edge or involved healthy doses of fortune. Not since well before Fergie left have a United side so utterly dominated a derby game. Both in and out of possession United dictated the pace and overwhelmed City with a relentless energy.",
      "Carrick was smart, which is a good sign, because he addressed the obvious thing first. United’s main defensive issue under Amorim was too much space in the midfield. So he made the team narrow, closed the space in between the lines, and put more men in the middle. Simple right.",
      "In particular playing Dorgu as a defensive winger who tucked into midfield really helped. It gave Mainoo the cover he needed to follow Foden/Cherki as they roamed and meant Amad and Bruno could jump out to press with Mbeumo when the opportunity arose.",
      "Going forward it wasn’t a case of playing it long and chasing through balls. United played out from the back and held possession in their own third with relative ease, then a straight pass through the middle, usually by Martinez or a very good Casemiro, triggered quick and aggressive attacks.",
      "There was a moment too when Mainoo received the ball then quickly turned the pressing Semenyo and passed out wide to start an attack. It was lovely and exactly the type of thing he needs to more of. He played well and looks so much more comfortable with midfield support though was outshone by many other excellent performances on the day. If he can do that press beating turn 3-4 times a game then he’ll quickly become the pivotal cog in our midfield.",
      "City though were just bad. The derby probably came at a good time for United given the current form of Pep’s team and apparent defensive line issues. There was period toward the end of the first half where Pep altered the positions slightly and City had us pinned to our box, they were knocking it around it that familiar way when they unpick a low block but the threat never came. They just didn’t shoot. Feels a bit like that period last season when they looked lost, almost like Pep trying to make them more direct has neglected the identity that made them so dominant.",
      "Looking forward on Carrick’s United it would be silly to take too much from this performance. Getting up for big games against rivals hasn’t been United’s problem. The comments from Shearer of ‘this performance level has to be the standard now’ just isn’t realistic and exactly what he said after the Liverpool win earlier this season. Derby games are unique because teams often find a higher than normal level. United do need more energy and urgency in general but expecting that performance every week is foolish.",
      "Tactically too Carrick can’t really do that to other teams. They will have to win whilst dominating possession and by unlocking the kind of low block he deployed on Saturday. United have been fairly proficient in attack this season, Carrick needs to find a way to maintain that threat whilst keeping control and remaining resolute in defence. That isn’t simple.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "…What a performance in the derby, probably our best in years, and I was delighted enough to watch the match back in full and highlights on MoTD. The team looked well organised, dangerous in attack, and the energy and desire to press, defend and close down space was tremendous.",
      "Nobody can question that we have the makings of a good squad and, therefore, there is some talent there; although here comes the b-bomb. But, these players have shown before that they can raise their game in the bigger matches, reflected in our healthy number of points gained against the top half of the table this season. Our issue has been the low-block teams when we have more of the ball – can we break those teams down and, more importantly, show the same hunger and desire to work hard off the ball to defend well as a team? Time will tell, so let’s keep our powder dry for now. (Making up 15 points at this stage is doable, yeah? Beat Arsenal and it’s only 12! Shh, they’ll say you’re crazy).",
      "In other news, I do hope those Liverpool fans calling for Slot’s head (did he not win the league last season or was that actually a bad dream) and hoping Alonso will come in know what they are letting themselves in for. They need to appreciate that his most successful system thus far has been using 3 at the back at Leverkusen, and arguably it was a shift from this system and style to placate the Madridistas that led to his demise there.",
      "Assuming that’s acceptable then brace yourselves, as you’re in for a treat. As soon as results start going south, which they will if even temporarily to restructure the squad, it is all you will hear about from the media, ex-players and impatient fellow fans. Until he is eventually hounded out with his 3-4-3 tail between his legs back to the Basque region and you bring in Stevie G or Ian Rush to save the day.",

      "Man Utd’s squad showed against Man City that they are capable of producing the necessary performances to fend off Liverpool and Chelsea for the Champions League, but this is reliant on Carrick getting more out of the playing staff than most managers since Ferguson, and history tells us that they will underdeliver more often than not.",

Otherwise, we would have to pretend that Manchester United beating Liverpool at Anfield in October was ‘proof’ that Ruben Amorim’s system was actually hunky-dory, thank you. And, well, f*** DNA.",

Sir Alex was in the director’s box smiling all afternoon long – why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.",

      "So this was a throwback, an instant change for the better. An upgrade on the Ruben Amorim era, a reminder of a time when United stood for something more than institutional discord or commercial enterprise. United took the game to Manchester City as equals, not inferiors. They didn’t try to pass them off the pitch because there will be only one winner of that contest; but they were aggressive, ambitious, vigorous, they ran and ran.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there. But could someone else still beat Frank to the finish?",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",

      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, it’s now six points from their last four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley in what is fast becoming the world’s least convincing unbeaten run ever.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like five points away, that deficit cut down after the Hammers visited Dr. Tottenham.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take further signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers.

He then spent 12 years at Atletico Madrid, first as technical director before becoming sporting director in 2017. Berta helped shape Atletico’s squad and is credited with an influence in the signings of the likes of Antoine Griezmann, Rodri and Jan Oblak. The Rojiblancos won two La Liga titles, the Europa League, and reached two Champions League finals under Diego Simeone on Berta’s watch.",

Owners Wes Edens, Nassef Sawiris and Michael Angelakis have put their faith in the manager, Unai Emery, to build the team around him, rather than place one of their men between themselves and a head coach. Olabe, the former Real Sociedad sporting director, was appointed as president of football operations in late 2025. The 58-year-old played with Emery at La Real, and had a very brief spell as coach before taking executive roles.

      "Rooney and everyone else associated with Man Utd are rightly delighted with what they saw from Carrick’s side as they deservedly beat arch-rivals Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "This was Carrick’s first game in charge at Man Utd since being appointed as Ruben Amorim’s interim replacement on a short-term deal until the summer.",
      "Carrick helped to inspire United’s best performance of the 2025/26 campaign against Man City, though it remains to be seen whether this can be replicated in the coming weeks as they look to seal Champions League qualification.",

      "“I think what Michael has done with the team wasn’t rocket science. It was a simple tweak in terms of what he’d done in terms of formation,” Rooney claimed on his BBC Sport podcast.",
      "READ: Slot, Carrick, Guardiola among 10 PL managers likely to leave their clubs before next season",
      "“I think everyone’s been talking a lot about Ruben Amorim’s formation in the back three and how it suited Man United as well.",

      "We hear a lot about “the DNA of the club”; Gary Neville was waffling about Manchester United’s recently. And people rarely question what is actually a complete fallacy.",
      "There’s talk of Spurs’ DNA being in opposition to Thomas Frank’s style of play and it will soon get him the sack. West Ham’s DNA is forever being let down or ignored by managers and owners and Liverpool seem to believe it is a unique characteristic that the club embodies. In fact, is there any club that doesn’t have DNA? Does Exeter City have a footballing double helix? Is former Celtic defender Gary Caldwell carrying on the traditions of the Third Division South Cup winners in 1933/34? Is he boll*cks.",
      "But people believe in it. What does it mean? Or perhaps more specifically, what do people think it means? It’s a bit nebulous and doesn’t surrender to serious thought and a bit like the EU laws that people claimed as reasons for their Brexit vote but could never name, I don’t believe anyone could tell you what DNA means in football and for it to make an ounce of sense.",
      "Take Manchester United. What was Neville referring to? When does this DNA thing come into being? When was it birthed? As far as it is possible to tell, he seems to think that basically it coincided with his playing career. It certainly didn’t seem to reach further back when United were a bit rubbish. Apparently DNA, the stuff of life, is only established when successful. So very much Andrei Kanchelskis and not Mike Duxbury. But can you select when your DNA begins and ends.",
      "DNA suggests something intrinsic and permanent, not just a few years in the mid 90s or indeed anything so subjective. In other words, talk of DNA is 100% rubbish. Your DNA cannot be defined as anything other than a ‘period when we were good’ or ‘the period when we played attractive football.’ You cannot choose your DNA; if your parents and grandparents are all ginger-haired, you can’t choose not to be ginger.",
      "Have you noticed that no club’s DNA is referred to as tedious, boring and defensive. “Yeah we’ve always played five at the back and tried to nick a goal.” Yet surely there have been many clubs that would describe well.",
      "There are things that define every club, of course. Positive or negative. For example, when I hear of Bolton, I always think of Kevin Davies’ buttocks and Kevin Nolan standing on a vibrating plate. But that’s just memories, not DNA. I’m sure Bolton fans don’t say “he doesn’t understand the club’s DNA” just because of the diminutive size of the centre forward’s arse, or whether the midfielder vibrates enough.",
      "Referring to this concept as a reason for sacking a manager is unfair and ridiculous and more often than not just really refers to losing a lot. Frank won’t be sacked for any other reason. If they were top playing boring and tedious football, their fans wouldn’t mind, just like Arsenal fans don’t. In fact, Tottenham’s habit of being rubbish but occasionally really good means they are carrying on the club’s greatest traditions. So if anything, Frank does know the club and its DNA. It’s surely better that Spurs get a manager who doesn’t understand the club DNA because inconsistency has been its hallmark for 60 years.",
      "There is no West Ham, Spurs, Chelsea or Arsenal ‘way’. The nearest thing to it is Manchester United always having a youth team player in the match-day squad. At least that is consistent, lasting 88 years since Saturday, October 30, 1937, over 4,300 consecutive games and more than 15 different managers.",
      "Endlessly talking about ‘someone who understands the DNA of the club’ is to aggrandise the club into a timeless entity that is objectively different to any other. It doesn’t happen outside of the biggest clubs, who do tend to have the most pretentious self-aggrandising fans. The nearest we get at Middlesbrough is the concept of ‘typical Boro’ which more describes the ability to mess things up at the last minute. People were saying it 55 years ago if we lost to a late goal. If you’d mentioned it being in the club’s DNA, you’d have been laughed out of the Holgate.",
      "If you’ve invented a standard to measure the current failing team against, then just say so, instead of claiming not playing with two wingers, is going against the club’s DNA. You don’t know how, why or what it means and you’ve just made it up. And that includes you, Gary.",

In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games. Could do little to stop either of Sunderland’s goals.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves before a very creditable clean sheet at Villa.",

      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad. Little he could do in the face of Carrick-ball.",

      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal. A first clean sheet in five against Brentford.",

      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4. And flapping at the corner that led to West Ham’s winner was a dreadful look.",

Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and had very little to do against Palace and Wolves either side of a madness against Leeds.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so but Big John fluffed his big chance.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save at Fulham and only one against Burnley from his own defender.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",

But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri was back in. Briefly, as it turned out. Darlow took the gloves again for a serene outing against Fulham.",

      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",

      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers.

      "Jamie Carragher has outlined his four-man shortlist to be the next Manchester United head coach, suggesting that their next permanent boss must be a candidate with the right \"energy\" and \"drive\" to lead the club forward.",
      "United parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month after a disastrous 14-month reign at the club and have since appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick secured an impressive 2-0 win against rivals Manchester City in his first game at the helm, but Carragher has insisted Old Trafford needs a \"special\" leader.",

      "Current role: England manager",
      "What Carragher said: \"He's been in the Premier League before. He's obviously a top manager. The thing I like about him is I still think he's got that energy and drive and spikiness about him.",
      "\"He's gone into the England squad, and he's ruffled feathers with some of the biggest players there. Now I'm not saying that has to happen in every job he's in, but there's something about him.",
      "\"He just feels like he would go to war for your club, and he'd be fighting against the other clubs, and he'd have something about him.\"",
      "Current role: Paris Saint-Germain",
      "What Carragher said: \"You would absolutely have him all day. Now we see him as the best manager in Europe. He didn't have a good time at Celta Vigo, he didn't have a good time at Roma, but Barcelona still appointed him.\"",
      "Current role: Newcastle United",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm a huge fan of Eddie Howe. The type of football when Newcastle are at their best is high energy going forward, but the real thing I like is that you have to be able to handle the pressures of Manchester United.",
      "\"When you're in Newcastle and you live in that city, it's constant and he handles it brilliantly. Where I think he could also help is that Manchester United have a problem with young players - a lot of them don't go on to fulfil their potential - but I think Eddie Howe is a great coach.\"",
      "Current role: Germany",
      "What Carragher said: \"I don't know everything about him but I do look at a coach with a big reputation, with a lot to prove in some ways.\"",
      "What Carragher said: \"I'm crossing out Michael Carrick. I go back to this question - do I believe this guy can win the league? I have to believe he can. I don't believe Man Utd will win the league with Carrick, or Chelsea will with Liam Rosenior. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you have to be special. I might be proven wrong.\"",
      "Carragher also highlighted why other candidates, such as Xabi Alonso, Diego Simeone and Oliver Glasner, aren't suitable for the role.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp will not be managing Manchester United. That is out. Xabi Alonso - he cannot do that. He can't, his affiliation with Liverpool. That can't happen.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti, for me, wouldn't have the energy or drive to get Man Utd back. Zinedine Zidane is a younger version of [Carlo] Ancelotti, but maybe I am wrong. Enzo Maresca is a no, but he is a really good coach.",
      "\"Xavi is one, at Barcelona, he won the league but enough experience for Manchester United? He only has a couple of years of experience as a manager.",
      "\"Roberto Martinez, if he does a brilliant job at Portugal, there is no doubt that Roberto is ready. The one thing he has not done in his career is manage an elite football club.",
      "\"He'd have to do something really special. Mauricio Pochettino is the same as Ancelotti. Chelsea went with Enzo Maresca as they wanted a young and energetic coach.",
      "Oliver Glasner, straight away, I'd say no because of the system. Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job and is linked with top jobs but Bournemouth to Man Utd is a big jump.",
      "\"This is the same for Marco Silva. I think the next step for them would be Tottenham. It feels more Tottenham-like for them. Roberto De Zerbi is a brilliant coach but he is liable to go to war with the owners within six weeks.",
      "\"Diego Simeone is an interesting one. I was speaking to Gary Neville about United's DNA. It is interesting that Roy [Keane] and Gary have both mentioned Simeone at different points.",
      "\"That goes away from what a club's DNA is because he is a defensive coach. You can't ask a manager to change.\"",

      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",
      "\"I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you see [them] here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",

      "Asked if such comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: \"No, no, nothing. It doesn't give me anything. My motivation is my family. That's it.\"",
      "Scholes, having seen the interview from Martinez, posted on Instagram on Sunday: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you. Tea, no sugar please…@lisandromartinezzz.\"",

      "Asked if much had changed since Carrick took over on Wednesday, Martinez said: \"So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy.",
      "\"He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",
      "\"He's a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.\"",
      "Martinez said \"the team today was different\", pointedly adding: \"When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",
      "The 28-year-old highlighted the new head coach's quiet confidence and the relentless backing from supporters.",
      "\"I feel amazing,\" Martinez said. \"I think we deserve to win this game.",
      "\"We were better on the pitch and I think we gave everything today. And when you give everything and you see the result, it's an amazing feeling and I'm so happy today.",

      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",

      "Scholes praised Martinez's display but said he still has some doubts about the 28-year-old.",
      "\"It fuels people,\" he said of criticism. \"I think we have to take a bit of the credit for Martinez's performance on Saturday!\"",
      "But he then warned: \"He's had one brilliant game, but when you start talking and shouting your mouth off, this game has a habit of coming and biting you back on the a***.",
      "\"I haven't changed my opinion yet. I'm still not sure you can win a league with him. He's got to do it over a period of time. What he did on Saturday, brilliant, but you've got to do it over a period of time.\"",
      "Butt said Martinez's reaction to their comments raised questions about his mentality.",
      "Butt pointed to the experience that he and the rest of United's 'Class of 92' had when Alan Hansen famously said on Match of the Day \"you can't win anything with kids\". A teenager at the time, Butt said that taught him to deal with criticism.",
      "\"I was 18, not 26 or 27,\" he said. \"I didn't want to go out of the house for weeks, but you man up and go and prove people wrong.\"",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "\"It has always been about the same thing, the love of it, just that feeling of being a football player, on the pitch, running after a ball. Obviously, you want to win and play in the best possible teams you can. But I think that love of football never leaves you.\"",
      "His new team Wolfsburg are not exactly flying in the Bundesliga. Earlier this month, they lost 8-1 to Bayern Munich. \"Not nice at all.\" But Eriksen scored as they bounced back with a win over St Pauli. \"We had a lot of stuff we had to prove to ourselves,\" he says.",
      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",

      "Michael Carrick marked his Manchester United homecoming by restoring a familiar feeling as an attacking display secured his side derby day spoils with a 2-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Having only been installed as head coach until the end of the season this week to replace the departed Ruben Amorim, United looked different and Old Trafford felt different.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opening goal, a fully deserved one, was one taken in vintage Man Utd fashion. Rayan Cherki's ball into the box, turned into a speedy three-pronged counterattack for United and Bruno Fernandes slipped in the goalscorer to net his seventh of the league season.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",
      "There were more shades of the past as Matheus Cunha, a second-half substitute, crossed into the area for Patrick Dorgu to finish.",
      "At that point, United had already had the ball in the back of the net twice with both finishes ruled out for offside. Both Amad Diallo and Fernandes thought they had given United the lead in the first half only to see the assistant referee's flag raised.",
      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",
      "While United impressed, they were fortunate to have ended the game with 11 men after Diogo Dalot escaped what Mike Dean called \"100 per cent\" a sending off after a challenge on Jeremy Doku.",
      "Pep Guardiola, though, could only watch on as his side were played off the park as title-chasing Man City could only muster one shot on target, relying on five crucial Gianluigi Donnarumma saves to also avoid humiliation.",
      "City are now at risk of falling nine points behind league leaders Arsenal, who play Nottingham Forest later on Saturday. Man Utd, meanwhile, move up to fourth.",
      "\"Today was special. Putting things together quickly and trying to put an imprint on the team. Gathering together and emotionally getting attached to what we want to do. I felt that was unbelievable from the staff and the players.",
      "\"I am not getting carried away. It is one result, but it needs to be a regular feeling with that level of performance.\"",
      "\"The better team won. They had energy we didn't have. Congratulations to them.",
      "\"They had the chances at the end with crosses. We know they are a transitional team, but in general they were better.",
      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",
      "\"We never made a threat, crosses or movement, but that's part of the energy.\"",
      "On Erling Haaland's substitution, Guardiola said the striker was taken off to introduce \"new energy\".",

      "Something about Manchester United's derby day was different, but it felt right.",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo scored his goal, the Stretford end roared. Not just because he had scored a timely goal in a dominant United display but because it represented what the Old Trafford faithful had explicitly or implicitly been crying out for.",
      "United galloped forward, led by Bruno Fernandes, flanked by Patrick Dorgu and Amad. Fearless, front foot and familiar. It was an attacking custom United have been used to.",
      "Though the 2-0 scoreline doesn't tell the story of United's control of the game, their season high of offsides that resulted in three disallowed goals reflect a tweaked style that got the best out of United's attacking array.",
      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in dire need of a rest. Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "Michael Carrick delivered an emphatic 2-0 victory over Man City in his first game as Man Utd head coach with Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu on the scoresheet; Gary Neville felt Bruno Fernandes was 'Cantona-esque' back playing as the No 10 after Ruben Amorim stuck with him in midfield",
      "Saturday 17 January 2026 18:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "With only three days of preparation, United's new head coach successfully brought back 4-4-2 and delivered a statement performance that reminded Neville of the club he used to play for.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville added.",
      "\"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "Neville added: \"It's not a time to say that Manchester United will sustain this and carry up the league, this has got to be a bridge towards potentially getting a European place, top five would be amazing.",
      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener came from a devastating counter-attack and wonderful combination play with captain Bruno Fernandes, no longer restricted to playing as a holding midfielder.",
      "\"I got quite emotional when that goal went in, because I thought, 'that's what I have been asking for, it's what everyone in this ground's been asking for'.",
      "\"Those players have set themselves a standard today, I have to say, they've set themselves a standard in attitude, in aggression, in positivity when they're playing with intent and playing through the lines, everything. You cannot drop below that.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes was Eric \"Cantona-esque\" back playing in the No 10 role after Ruben Amorim had so stubbornly stuck with him as a deep midfielder.",
      "\"That's where he's got to play, be near to goal, be where you can hurt them, because he's a great player. We don't want to see him back in a midfield two in front of a back three.",
      "\"Is that where we want to see him? No, it's definitely not right. I just saw so many things that reminded me of what this club plays like, what their DNA is, what they should be.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always said Manchester United's system is such, you have a forward and then you have a No 10, it can be [Dwight] Yorke, it can be Cantona, it can be [Wayne] Rooney, it can be [Carlos] Tevez, it can be [Dimitar] Berbatov. Those players that just drop in off a striker, Scholes did it for a number of years.",
      "\"We've always had that most talented player close to our striker and feeding them, and that's what made me a little bit emotional on that goal.\"",
      "Before the game, Neville said Carrick's spell in charge should be limited to the rest of the season as he called on INEOS to bring in an experienced head coach.",
      "Despite his delight over the manner of the win, Neville said Carrick's aim should be handing over the team in the best shape possible for the next coach.",
      "\"It is not a time to get giddy or carried away,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Michael Carrick has laid a foundation today for the next four months, and if he can continue to lay that foundation here with that level of performance for the next four months, the person who picks up the baton at the end of the season can be in a good place.",
      "\"Ralf Rangnick came, it didn't quite happen in terms of that handover. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer came in and then got given the job. Michael Carrick's got to hand that baton over in good shape, and that is an unbelievable start for him.\"",

      "\"They start really strong, that's normal.",

      "\"I said to Michael and all the players right now here, they deserve that change. It's a red card - definitely. But that will not make us grow up. The new players knew exactly what they had to do, but it's what it is.",
      "\"I could say that [the red would have changed the game] and blame. We will not grow up, we will not move forward. But what happened is not a surprise at all for me, but it's not happened in the past.",
      "\"When I arrived here, one action, it happened with these referees in Chelsea, in Man City, Chelsea-Gundogan with [N'golo Kante].",
      "\"So now I start to realise, it's not about that. Because with that, we grow up, always talking. We have to look at ourselves, honestly. So, what happened in the situation? We should differently, maybe, but who knows.",
      "\"There are a lot of teams that win with ten against 11, and I get the feeling with the game that we played, maybe we'll have no win. If the players have excuses for that reason, we'll be in trouble in the future. We have to look at ourselves, and today it's simple.\"",

      "The former Middlesbrough boss is the 11th different person to sit in the hotseat at Old Trafford since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Another managerial switch has added to fan discontent with protests planned for next month.",

      "\"Results and sometimes from the outside things look a little bit different, but it certainly doesn't feel majorly different on the inside.",
      "\"Part of my role and the responsibility is shaping what we want to look like going forward as a group.
