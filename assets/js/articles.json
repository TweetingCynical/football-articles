      "Ryan Giggs had his say on Kobbie Mainoo(Image: Jan Kruger/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs has said he hopes Kobbie Mainoo remains at the club as a crucial deadline looms over the youngster's future. The talented midfielder had been the subject of intense transfer speculation before Ruben Amorim's departure earlier this month.",
      "Michael Carrick has since taken the reins on an interim basis until the end of the 2025/26 season, with the Manchester derby immediately demanding his focus. However, he has just over a fortnight to reshape his squad and offload any surplus players ahead of the transfer window closing.",
      "Mainoo is expected to stay at Old Trafford for the remainder of the campaign, after seeing a prospective loan turned down by the club earlier in the season amid interest from Napoli. But in the summer, he will enter the final year of his current deal.",
      "Negotiations over a new contract have hit an impasse, with Mainoo still among the club's lowest earners on terms he agreed back in February 2023. Chelsea are even rumoured to be monitoring the situation.",
      "The 20-year-old has made just two starts in the 2025/26 season, both resulting in cup eliminations. Giggs believes Mainoo needs to remain patient.",
      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United,\" Giggs told BetSelect.",
      "\"It's like a striker. You don't see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult. But yeah, we all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient.",
      "\"He's still young, he's still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I'd like to see him stay.\"",
      "Michael Carrick is in charge of Kobbie Mainoo for now(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Carrick appears to have already mapped out how best to deploy Mainoo. In a conversation with Rio Ferdinand back in September, he explained: \"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating.",
      "\"I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Patience might prove crucial as Mainoo looks set to continue vying with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot, unless Carrick decides to deploy the England starlet in a midfield partnership, whilst pushing Fernandes forward into United's No. 10 role.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes may be pondering his Manchester United future again(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick is getting his feet under the table after becoming Manchester United's latest interim boss. Carrick got the nod ahead of fellow Old Trafford favourite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to take charge until the end of the season following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Carrick has landed in the hotseat in the middle of a transfer window, which looks like being a quiet one for United. That isn't to say feverish work isn't going on behind the scenes at Carrington, despite the fact that we don't know who will be leading the club into next season.",
      "Midfield is an obvious area in need of attention, with the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson on the club's wishlist. Realistically, none of those players will be available this month. However, groundwork will be laid, fans will hope, to ensure the club is in the best possible position to strengthen in the summer window.",
      "Champions League qualification would help on that front and despite a chaotic campaign so far, a top four or five finish isn't out of the question. Here's a round-up of the latest United transfer news…",
      "It's not just potential signings United will be thinking about but departures too. It will be necessary to move on some under-performing players to make room for quality additions.",
      "However, United will be desperate to keep one of their few reliable performers, Bruno Fernandes, happy amid suggestions the captain is growing restless as the club lurches from one crisis to another.",
      "The Portuguese star had the chance to move to the Saudi Pro League last summer but decided to stay put, declaring that he still wanted to \"play at the highest level and compete for major titles.\" However, with United out of both cup competitions and the title race, Fernandes is likely to be getting itchy feet again.",
      "The i Paper reports that there is \"general fear\" around the club that Fernandes may \"had enough\" and will look to move this summer. Having had a close relationship with Amorim, his countryman's sacking may have pushed the 31-year-old closer to the exit door himself.",
      "Fernandes has 18 months left on his United deal with the option of a further 12 months, meaning this summer could be crunch time for his future at the club. Bayern Munich are reportedly among the clubs monitoring the situation.",
      "Fernandes's patience may be running out(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Given United's struggles, enticing a quality midfielder to the club may be easier said than done this summer. However, one middleman has made it clear he would relish a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Frank Onyeka, who has played a part in Brentford's excellent season under Keith Andrews, had openly admitted he would welcome a move to Old Trafford. It should be noted that he was put on the spot by a fan during the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Brentford's Frank Onyeka is clearly fond of United(Image: PA)",
      "When asked if he would like to play for United, Onyeka cheerily answered: \"Of course I want to play for Manchester United!\"",
      "A move to Old Trafford looks unlikely, given he has made just nine appearances for the Bees this season. For now, Onyeka is focused on AFCON glory in Morocco after helping Nigeria to the semi-finals, where they will face the host nation.",

The club has shared snaps of the duo's first outing back after their stint at the Africa Cup of Nations, as the team gears up for this weekend's showdown with Manchester City.",

      "Former Sunderland loanee Amad might be particularly chuffed to work under Carrick, having previously expressed admiration for him. The forward was honoured to inherit his shirt number at United.",
      "\"When I was told that I was getting the No. 16 shirt, I was happy because I know that Michael Carrick had previously worn that shirt for a long time and so it is a number worn by a legend of the club,\" Amad revealed previously.",

      "Michael Carrick will, yet again, be standing where Sir Alex Ferguson once stood at Old Trafford. (Image: Matthew Peters, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson's former right-hand man Rene Meulensteen has offered to share his expertise with Michael Carrick during his stint as Manchester United's interim boss. The 44-year-old Carrick was handed the reins this week, stepping in just over a week after Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "With United sitting as close to 12th as they are fourth place, there's precious little room for mistakes. Meulensteen, who served as Ferguson's assistant from 2008 to 2013, has made it clear he's ready to offer Carrick support over the phone should he require it over the next few months.",
      "Speaking to Casinostugan, the ex-Fulham boss said: \"It's 12 and a half years since I left United. So many managers have come and gone and Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] has been there, and there's never been any talks, so I don't really think about it.",
      "\"Those 12 and a half years are a long time. So many things have changed. What we had under Sir Alex was unique. You had the most successful manager in the history of English football and everything was done a certain way and we played with a style and all that is gone now.",
      "\"Everything is different. The players are different. The environment is different. There are different roles.",
      "\"You have no idea what kind of impact you could have. Obviously, if Michael Carrick or someone else rang me, I'd pick up the phone. Of course you would, wouldn't you!\"",
      "Meulensteen knows Carrick well. (Image: 2013 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick takes charge of a United side languishing in seventh place in the Premier League standings, three points adrift of the Champions League spots. The former midfielder faces a daunting baptism of fire in his second caretaker spell, kicking off with a Manchester derby at Old Trafford, followed by a trip to table-toppers Arsenal.",
      "When questioned about what the ex-England star needs to prioritise, Meulensteen stressed that Carrick must swiftly establish his tactical approach. The Dutchman added: \"There's a lot of different players at United at this moment of time so you have to sort of rebuild a few things again.",
      "\"Amorim was trying to mould them into a system that never really worked. That's a challenge for Michael now to set them up in a system that suits the players.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough in June. (Image: 2025 Allstar)",
      "\"Everybody knows he has taken the job as the interim manager all the way up to the summer. So we will have to wait and see before we look beyond what Manchester United are going to do then.",
      "\"Can Carrick do enough to remain as the permanent manager like Solskjaer did when he was brought in as caretaker? It could happen because let's assume he goes on an unbelievable, unbeaten run and secures top-four, gets Champions League football, and they've got nothing else to worry about.",
      "\"At this moment in time, all they need to do is make sure that they win as many games in the Premier League as they possibly can, but I think what people will also look at is the way they are going to play under Michael. And his style of play.\"",

      "Manchester United's squad problems are beginning to resolve themselves, and at the perfect moment too, as Michael Carrick prepares for his first match as interim manager in Saturday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford.",
      "United have found it difficult to gain the upper hand against local rivals Manchester City in recent years, managing just one victory in their last five encounters on home turf. This latest instalment of the historic rivalry comes as the Red Devils have recently implemented sweeping changes to their coaching setup.",
      "Previous boss Ruben Amorim was sacked earlier this month. On Tuesday - just four days ahead of Pep Guardiola's team's arrival - an agreement was reached for former United midfielder Carrick to return as interim manager for the rest of the 2025/26 season.",
      "European qualification is still within reach for United this season, and Carrick is keen to get off to the best possible start at Old Trafford - with a baptism of fire against Manchester City this weekend. That's why the sight of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo back at Carrington was such a boost.",
      "Both players have been absent since mid-December, having been called up to represent their respective countries in this year's Africa Cup of Nations. Amad was part of the reigning champions Ivory Coast team, while Mbeumo played for Cameroon.",
      "Unfortunately, both experienced defeat in the quarter-finals last weekend. Ivory Coast were knocked out by Egypt, while Cameroon lost to tournament hosts Morocco, who boast fellow United star Noussair Mazraoui in their ranks.",
      "Despite the personal disappointment, this means they can now focus on their club campaign for 2025/26, returning to a very different United than the one they left last month. With Carrick at the helm, both returning players could find themselves competing for a starting spot.",
      "Amad and Bryan Mbeumo were back for Michael Carrick's first training session as Man Utd boss(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The interim coach is planning to deviate from Amorim's favoured 3-4-3 formation, opting instead for a back-four. Carrick typically set his team up in a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time in charge of Championship outfit Middlesbrough.",
      "The previous arrangement allowed both players to start, with Mbeumo in the attack and Amad overlapping but tasked with more defensive duties. Before their departure for AFCON, the former netted seven goals and provided one assist in 17 appearances for United, while the latter contributed two goals and two assists.",
      "However, it was Amad who shone brighter at AFCON. In his own attacking role, the 23-year-old scored three times and assisted once in five games, compared to Mbeumo's single assist in the same number of appearances.",
      "So, Carrick has a crucial choice to make regarding who will start on the right wing when United face City this weekend.",
      "Michael Carrick will take charge of United against Man City this weekend(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" the former England international declared upon his appointment. \"I know what it takes to succeed here, my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",

      "Simon Jordan thinks there is a specific reason Manchester United didn't hire Ole Gunnar Solskjaer(Image: talkSPORT)",
      "Simon Jordan believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was overlooked for the Manchester United job because appointing him would have been based on sentiment rather than merit. The Norwegian managed the Red Devils for nearly three years between 2018 and 2021.",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's exit, United have finally appointed a new head coach to see out the remainder of the season. Darren Fletcher had been at the helm for two fixtures, a 2-2 draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat to Brighton, but Michael Carrick has now taken charge.",
      "Carrick previously managed United on a caretaker basis when Solskjaer was dismissed in November 2021. During his brief spell, he secured two victories from three matches and drew the other.",
      "For some time, the Norwegian appeared to be the frontrunner to replace Amorim on an interim basis, but Carrick was ultimately given the role. Former Crystal Palace chairman Jordan suggests Solskjaer was passed over because his appointment wouldn't have been seen as forward-thinking, with popularity alone insufficient grounds for his return.",
      "\"Carrick did a good job at Middlesbrough. But it's interesting, when I was speaking to most people last week, there were various people finding out whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in the frame,\" Jordan said on talkSPORT.",
      "\"Mike Phelan hadn't been contacted. And there is this thought process that Phelan and Solskjaer travel together, as we've seen previously.",
      "\"So, whether they have reacted to the public backlash or the perception of people criticising the fact that this appointment hadn't worked previously, and you'd be going back without any innovation.",
      "Solskjaer spent almost three years in charge of United(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Or whether Carrick... Because I heard that Carrick wants to be a coach, wants to be a No. 2, doesn't want to be a frontman. But he clearly did a decent job at Middlesbrough. Clearly he's a sensible head.",
      "\"It looks different, and that's I think one of the criticisms about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Not against Ole, I have my own views on whether he's a good manager or not.",
      "\"But because it didn't look particularly, in any shape or form, like there was any thinking behind it. 'Oh, okay, that looks like a popular fit and everyone likes him. He's unchallenging in people's minds.'",
      "\"That might well be the challenge that Man United have to do now, which is keep on playing to an optic rather than getting an outcome. We'll see. As I say, Carrick has done a decent job at Middlesbrough, but Man United is a whole different ball game.\"",
      "Carrick has been appointed until the end of the season(Image: Getty)",
      "Upon his appointment as head coach, Carrick expressed confidence in his ability to bring out the best in his United players. He said: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour.",

      "Michael Carrick scored highly in three areas that Manchester United bosses were looking at with his knowledge of the current players helping him land the head coach role until the end of the season.",
      "The former midfielder was up against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy as the club sought someone to take charge of the team for the coming months following the sacking of Ruben Amorim. Carrick, an assistant at Old Trafford previously, impressed Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada in person.",
      "During their discussions it became clear that Carrick had good intel and detail about the squad members. That no doubt owing to his spell at the club where he worked with a number of them, including Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot.",
      "His ability to lead a team was also cited as a major plus, reports the Daily Mail. Carrick had spent almost three years in charge of Middlesbrough and thus taking the major role isn't new to him, even if it will now be on a far greater scale in Manchester.",
      "Finally Carrick's willingness to work collaboratively was something that attracted the United hierarchy. It is well documented that Amorim wanted more influence at Old Trafford, taking issue with his head coach title as he sought more of a managerial role - which ultimately cost him. Carrick has already been informed that he will need to work with what he's got in Manchester.",
      "Despite being on the shortlist Van Nistelrooy, unlike Solskjer and Carrick, didn't get to meet the club's bosses face-to-face. He had an caretaker spell after Erik ten Hag was sacked last season and is known by the hierarchy, thus they didn't feel the need to meet him again.",
      "The two senior executives did sit down with Sir Alex Ferguson for coffee at Carrington last Tuesday, just 24 hours after Amorim was given his marching orders, and sought his advice about what should come next. Ferguson is said to have endorsed Carrick, a player he signed from Tottenham.",
      "Michael Carrick got the nod ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer(Image: PA)",
      "Additional discussions with Carrick involved who would work underneath him. The new head coach is close to Jonny Evans, another former player who will now work with in the coaching staff. He also wanted Jonathan Woodgate, his former assistant at Middlesbrough, with the duo having a close bond and a good working relationship. They drove to training together on Wednesday.",
      "None of them had worked with Steve Holland, the ex-England assistant in the past, but it was felt that the former Chelsea coach had a skillset and the experience that would be beneficial in the new set-up.",

      "Rio Ferdinand says Michael Carrick’s first objective at Manchester United should be to restore the confidence of his players. Carrick was announced as the club’s new interim manager on Tuesday, taking over after Ruben Amorim’s sacking last week.",
      "The former Red Devils midfielder, who had a brief unbeaten stint in charge as caretaker manager in 2021, will lead the side until the end of the season, following his own dismissal at Middlesbrough seven months ago.",
      "United have been woeful defensively, only conceding fewer goals than the bottom six, which has resulted in inconsistent results. Perhaps most importantly, the players by the end of Amorim’s 14-month reign were visibly playing within themselves, something club legend Ferdinand believes Carrick should address right away.",
      "The ex-defender is of the view that Carrick should try to foster confidence by getting results, potentially playing a defensive and less expansive style initially.",
      "He said on Rio Ferdinand Presents: “I think he’s got to instil confidence back into this team. I think it doesn’t matter what players you’ve got or how good they are, they’ll never give the best version of themselves if they’re lacking confidence.",
      "“To do that, there’s things he’s going to have to do behind the scenes to bring them together and to make them start believing in themselves through training and creating patterns. But then it’s down to results.",
      "“They’ve got to find a way of getting results. If that, for the moment, is playing a different style of football that suits this group, perhaps more counter-attacking to build confidence… Then you can start moulding the team in time into a new shape and the way you want it to be.”",
      "Rio Ferdinand says Carrick must restore the players' confidence(Image: Rio Ferdinand Presents)",
      "He added: “Without the confidence right now it will be really difficult, almost impossible, to build any momentum with this team and get us into a respectable position at the end of the season.”",
      "Carrick, a five-time Premier League and one-time Champions League winner with United, will be well aware of what a confident and positive dressing room looks like, having learned first hand from the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Carrick will now prepare the team for two daunting tasks, beginning with the visit of Manchester City at the weekend. He is expected to deviate from the controversial 3-4-3 formation implemented by Amorim, both in that game and against league leaders Arsenal the following weekend.",

      "Former Manchester United coach, Rene Meulensteen, has tipped Carlo Ancelotti as the ideal candidate to take over the reins at Old Trafford. The Red Devils are on the hunt for a new permanent manager following the sacking of Ruben Amorim last week.",
      "Ex-United midfielder Michael Carrick has been appointed as the interim head coach until the season's end, with his primary objective being to secure Champions League football for the club. Carrick, who previously managed Middlesbrough, won over the United board during discussions and will be supported by Steve Holland and Travis Binnion at M16.",
      "Carrick's first test will be this Saturday's lunchtime Premier League clash against Manchester City (12.30pm). Despite his appointment, speculation continues to swirl about who will be named as United's next permanent boss.",
      "The club is expected to announce a full-time head coach at the conclusion of the season, with several high-profile names in the mix. Luis Enrique and Roberto De Zerbi have been mooted, along with Xabi Alonso, who recently departed Real Madrid.",
      "He said: \"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he's done it, he's seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like. I don't think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else.",
      "\"Ancelotti would say this is what I'm doing. I'm managing what I'm here to do.",
      "\"They obviously weren't aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than people in the background.\"",
      "Ex-Reds skipper Gary Neville has recently concurred with Meulensteen that Ancelotti is a prime candidate to take over the reins at United.",
      "\"With these last 12 years being a period of massive underperformance for Manchester United managers, there are certain boxes the next candidate now needs to tick,\" Neville penned in the Overlap newsletter.",
      "Gary Neville wants Carlo Ancelotti at Manchester United(Image: Emilee Chinn - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images)",
      "\"1. You have to be able to handle the media and the noise which comes with this club. It is what it is, so get over it and deal with it. It's why you're getting paid the big bucks.",
      "\"2. You have to show that you can have success getting into the top four, that you can cope with Champions League football, and that you can get the best out of a group of players that will include egos and superstars.",
      "\"3. You must understand the Premier League and English football culture because it's different to competing in many of the European leagues.",
      "\"4. You also have to understand the Manchester United way, which means you have to be a glass-half-full kind of manager. Be positive and prepared to take risks and play with pace and excitement. In all likelihood that is going to a variation of 4-4-1-1 / 4-2-3-1.",
      "\"You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and, as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final.",
      "\"No-one comes as close to fulfilling everything laid out above than he does. Ironically, the club met with Carlo shortly before his [Sir Alex Ferguson's] retirement in 2013 and we could have short-circuited this entire process, starting with him at the beginning of the cycle.",
      "\"But, by that stage, he was close to agreeing to joining Real Madrid for his first spell in charge and so what might have been a perfect appointment never happened.\"",

      "Huge investment was made in the summer with more than £200million spent on their frontline, bringing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha all to Old Trafford. That didn't help Ruben Amorim retain his job though and Michael Carrick has now been put in charge.",
      "The new man at the helm will be expected to work with the squad he has inherited in Manchester, reports ESPN, with the club having no desire to dip into the market this month.",
      "United are aware of their need to bolster certain parts of their squad, particularly the centre of midfield, which was a position Amorim wanted to strengthen. None of the team's targets are available currently and the hierarchy do not want to spend money on a short-term solution.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Brighton's Carlos Baleba are all on their radar but neither of them will be sold by their clubs in January.",
      "It is also understood that any sale are unlikely with Joshua Zirkzee, who has been heavily linked with a return to Italy, staying put. There was a lot of noise around Kobbie Mainoo in recent months given his lack of game time, but he too is expected to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils lost to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, ending their last hope of a trophy. Their recent form has seen them win just once across their last seven games, that coming against Newcastle, but Carrick and his backroom will have to reinvigorate the current crop.",
      "Man United have been linked with Elliot Anderson, but he won't be moving in January(Image: PA)",
      "Those in charge at Old Trafford believe with players returning from injury and forwards Mbeumo and Amad Diallo set to be back from their stints at the Africa Cup of Nations that Carrick has enough depth and quality available to him to make something of the second half of the year.",

      "The 44-year-old steps into the dugout following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim last week, having previously held the reins at United for three games in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked.",
      "It remains to be seen what United under Carrick will look like and how he will set the team up. However, his past interviews suggest out-of-favour youngster Mainoo could return to the starting XI.",
      "Mainoo enjoyed a meteoric rise at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag, having graduated from the academy. He most notably played a pivotal role in their 2024 FA Cup triumph over Manchester City before becoming a fully-fledged England international.",
      "Yet, the Stockport-born midfielder found himself sidelined under Amorim, despite the latter's limited midfield options. The 20-year-old was reportedly considering leaving United but may now find a reprieve under Carrick, particularly given the manager's previous comments.",
      "In a conversation with fellow club legend Rio Ferdinand last year, Carrick was asked if he would build the midfield around Mainoo. Carrick responded: \"Yeah, I think for a club to have a player that’s come through the academy and knows the club and feels it… I think Man United’s got to have an element of that. It always has done and always should have.",
      "\"To have a talent like Mainoo, which he’s shown already, you’ve got to have players like that [in the team], players that you can say, ‘They get it. They know it. Let’s help them and stick with them’. I think there’s definitely a place for him there, for sure.\"",
      "His comments followed reports suggesting Mainoo had been exploring a summer move to Napoli, only for Amorim to block the transfer. Carrick's views echo those of legendary United manager Ferguson, who famously built his success around academy products like the Class of '92.",
      "The Scottish icon emphasised that homegrown talent was vital to United's DNA when asked about Mainoo and the now departed Alejandro Garnacho in 2024.",
      "Mainoo may get a second chance under Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sir Alex told TikToker Jamal Niaz: \"It’s the foundation, isn’t it? It’s the heart and soul of what Manchester United has been since the days of Sir Matt Busby, who started the whole process of trusting young players playing.",
      "\"They’re young. What they’re showing at the moment, the composure and confidence to play in the first team, and not be daunted by it. In a way, it shows you the kind of courage they have. It’s a distinction in human beings, some have the will to be that [fearless at a young age].\"",
      "How Carrick plans to deploy Mainoo is yet to be seen, especially considering his previous comments to Ferdinand where he identified the youngster as an attacking midfielder. Carrick said: \"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",

      "Mason Greenwood scored a hat-trick for Marseille on Tuesday(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The French media were left singing Mason Greenwood’s praises after the former Manchester United forward’s latest hat-trick for Marseille. Greenwood played the full 90 minutes of Tuesday's Coupe de France match, where Ligue 1 giants Marseille showed no mercy against sixth-tier side Bayeux, securing a 9-0 victory at the Stade Michel d'Ornano in Caen.",
      "Bayeux's decision to avoid a defensive set-up backfired spectacularly, bringing their impressive run in the tournament to an end. Roberto De Zerbi's team were never under threat, with another ex-United player, Angel Gomes, breaking the deadlock after just 13 minutes.",
      "After that, the goals came thick and fast, with Greenwood finding the back of the net in the 26th minute with a left-footed effort. The 24-year-old, who left United for good in July 2024, grabbed his second goal shortly after the break to make it 5-0.",
      "After setting up Amine Gouiri with a cross and then CJ Egan-Riley with a pinpoint corner, Greenwood rounded off his hat-trick with the final kick of the game. That secured him the match ball and took his season's goal tally to 19 in all competitions.",
      "Greenwood played a part in five of his side's nine goals(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Publication Ouest France highlighted Greenwood's dominant display, emphasising why he's become Marseille's most crucial attacking threat this campaign. They said: \"With a dazzling performance from Mason Greenwood, who scored a hat-trick and provided two assists, Marseille will face Stade Rennais in the round of 16.\"",
      "Ouest added: \"Facing Olympique de Marseille, nine-time French champions, the R1 amateurs were outmatched, suffering a resounding 9-0 defeat against a disciplined and focused team led by Roberto De Zerbi, exemplified by Mason Greenwood's hat-trick and two assists.\"",
      "Regional newspaper La Provence offered equally positive praise for Greenwood, awarding him a 7.5/10 rating on the night.",

      "Michael Carrick has been handed the Man Utd job until the end of the year(Image: PA)",
      "Jamie Redknapp believes Manchester United landing Steve Holland as their assistant manager could be a subplot to getting Gareth Southgate in at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils have bought in Michael Carrick as their boss until the end of the season, and surrounded him with some impressive thinkers. Holland is among those with the former Chelsea and England No 2 bringing a wealth of experience.",
      "His most impressive work came alongside Southgate at England, helping them reach two major tournament finals. They left their roles in the aftermath of Euro 2024 and Southgate hasn't had another managerial gig since.",
      "The former England boss has been linked with the job in Manchester in the past. He was championed by Dan Ashworth, formerly part of the hierarchy at Old Trafford, and Redknapp claims getting Holland could lead to Southgate eventually being appointed.",
      "Carrick will be the man making the decisions for now. He served as assistant to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then had three matches in charge after the Norwegian's sacking - going unbeaten in that time. His immediate remit will be Champions League qualification.",
      "\"I think it's a sensible appointment,\" said Redknapp. \"You talk about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who had done it before as an interim. He did well. I thought this is the more sensible one out of the two. I've met Michael and played against him. He's a student of the game. He knows the game inside out. I think he's just got to do his best to get them into the top four or five.",
      "Steve Holland spent a long period working with Gareth Southgate at England, but will take up a job in Manchester(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"If he achieves Champions League football I think that would be a great achievement for him. He did a really good job at Middlesbrough. He didn't quite get them into the Premier League, so I think he'll do a good job.\"",
      "Carrick, despite only being in charge until the end of the season, is among the favourites for the job at his former club. Despite only being a stop gap the club have shown that they will change course if results dictate. Solskjaer was only an interim in 2018 but his impressive form saw him land the job permanently.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo and Michael Carrick could set be for a potentially lucrative reunion(Image: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United's interim boss Michael Carrick could be in for an unexpected reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo in a move that could potentially bring in £10m for the club. The Sun reports that the Reds are considering a mid-season friendly in Saudi Arabia to help plug the club's financial gap, which would reunite the two United icons.",
      "It is suggested that a trip to Saudi Arabia could net around £10million, especially with only 17 matches left this season following their early FA Cup exit. The loss to Brighton marked the earliest United have been knocked out of both domestic trophies since the 1981-82 season.",
      "With no place in European football last year, the club is now set to play just 40 games this campaign, the fewest in a season for 111 years. Last season, United earned £160.3m in match-day revenue from 30 games, boosted by their journey to the Europa League Final, where they were ultimately defeated by Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Now, the club will host ten fewer games at Old Trafford this season compared to the previous one, with each game estimated to be worth approximately £5.3 million. Their FA Cup exit has created two gaps in the schedule when the fourth and fifth rounds of the competition are due to occur.",
      "This means United will have a 13-day break in February and a further 10-day hiatus in March before the international break. The newspaper reports that United have been in discussions with the chairman of the General Entertainment Authority of Saudi Arabia about a potential visit to the country.",
      "While it's not guaranteed that the club will end up visiting the Middle East, if they do, they could potentially face Ronaldo's Al-Nassr as part of the proposed plans for The Riyadh Season Cup. Carrick shared the pitch with the Portuguese superstar during the 2000s and later managed Ronaldo during his first stint as caretaker manager back in 2021.",
      "Michael Carrick was previously Manchester United's caretaker manager(Image: Action Images via Reuters)",
      "The Riyadh Season typically runs from October to March, and the aforementioned cup - a three-way tournament against Ronaldo's team and fellow capital club Al-Hilal - could be on the cards. United missed out on a whopping £100m in prize money after their defeat to Spurs in the Europa League Final last May, which resulted in a significant drop in match-day revenue.",
      "To counteract this shortfall, the club decided to increase ticket prices, with new executive seating in the lower South Stand at Old Trafford also introduced as a measure to offset any loss of income. The pre-season tour of Asia saw Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Co. rake in around £7.8million, while a trip to the US almost matched that figure a month later.",
      "Other clubs such as AC Milan, RB Leipzig and Sevilla also failed to secure European football and could be potential opponents if a mid-season friendly is arranged.",

And it was the Norwegian, who managed United from 2018 to 2021 after initially impressing in an interim capacity, who was deemed by many to be the favourite for the head coach gig.",

      "Darren Fletcher lifted the veil on Manchester United's season when he so expressly laid down a return to the Champions League as the primary target for the remaining 17 games of the campaign. Forget just qualifying for Europe, it is the top table where United want to be sitting.",
      "They begin the Michael Carrick era in seventh in the Premier League, but a congested table offers them hope, although it might look a little less packed once the 44-year-old has navigated games against Manchester City and Arsenal over the next couple of weeks.",
      "United are on 32 points after 21 games. Continue on that trajectory and it is clear it won't be enough. There is also a feeling they have just wasted a heaven-sent run of fixtures and that Carrick will now face a more demanding schedule.",
      "There is at least the consolation of fifth place once again being almost certain to secure Champions League football next season. Brentford currently occupy that position, which suggests the race is still wide open. It would be a seismic shock if Keith Andrews' side were still there at the end of May.",
      "A glance through recent history shows what United should be aiming for. The last five Premier League seasons all ended with fifth place, earning between 66 and 69 points. On three occasions, it was 66 points, and that is the route Carrick should be aiming for.",
      "That is because Brentford's current tally of 33 points is below the total of the fifth-place team at this stage of the last five campaigns. They all had between 36 and 40 points. That opens up the possibility of a lower total doing the job this season, but United aren't the only side hoping to finish strongly.",
      "So if 66 points should be the target for fifth, how do United get there? They need 34 points from their final 17 games, which is clearly a challenge. Ten wins and four draws would do it, or 11 wins and a draw.",
      "Given Carrick's tenure starts with games against the top two, it is a challenge. If the games against Manchester City and Arsenal end without victory, it will become 11 wins from 15 games.",
      "United also face games against Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, and Liverpool during Carrick's time in charge, all of who are likely to be battling them for a top-four or top-five finish.",
      "They will need to rediscover a sense of strength at Old Trafford, having endured a dismal run of home form that could prove costly come the end of the season. If Carrick can land home wins against Fulham, Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Leeds, Brentford and Nottingham Forest, then he is halfway there.",
      "Three wins away from games against West Ham, Everton, Bournemouth, Sunderland and Brighton would be a solid return. That leaves two more to get.",
      "A trip to Newcastle in March looks tricky, as does Stamford Bridge in April. Maybe the best chance of victories are home games against Aston Villa and Liverpool. Two of those four fixtures against Champions League rivals might need to end with three points.",
      "Follow that plan and land 11 wins out of 17 games, and Carrick should have achieved what he has been appointed to do. Reach the Champions League, and who knows what the future holds.",
      "Carrick's 11 wins: Fulham (H), Tottenham (H), West Ham (A), Everton (A), Crystal Palace (H), Aston Villa (H), Leeds (H), Brentford (H), Liverpool (H), Sunderland (A), Nottingham Forest (H)",

      "Michael Carrick has beaten Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the interim head coach job at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "11 weeks ago, Michael Carrick thought it had clicked. He sat in the Match of the Day studio, a beaming smile on his face, and talked about the connections that were starting to develop in the Manchester United team. He could see players who were enjoying their football again and a team that had \"a sense of fun\". He was having fun watching them.",
      "Life comes at you fast around these parts. Carrick will swap the casual sweater and the lapel mic for a suit and a tactics board this weekend when he leads United out against Manchester City at Old Trafford. The smiles have long gone and he will encounter frowns and grimaces when he greets the players at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Carrick's effusive assessment of a United performance on Match of the Day came after the 4-2 win against Brighton. It was a third straight win and one of the best Premier League performances under Ruben Amorim. It felt like the Amorim era was finally going somewhere.",
      "As it turned out, it was another dead end. Only three of the next 11 games were won before Amorim pressed for the ejector button in spectacular fashion. Now Carrick has to pick up the pieces in a campaign he thought was well on track not so long ago.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox have conducted a tour of United's old boys over the past week and have faced criticism for doing so. They have been lambasted for not having a plan after sacking Amorim. However, there is a reason for this, and that is nobody expected Amorim to explode in the manner he did and as quickly as he did.",
      "Tensions came to a head at astonishing speed and within a matter of days the Portuguese went from retaining the support of the United hierarchy to seeing his position become untenable. Even for the soap opera of the modern-day United, it was a whirlwind.",
      "In the circumstances, this is probably as good a move as Berrada and Wilcox could have made. They resisted the temptation to get too sepia with the return of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, instead opting for the sensible route with a coach whose best years are ahead of him.",
      "It's not easy to see where Solskjaer's next job comes from if it wasn't answering a distress call at Old Trafford. For Carrick, 44, there is still the promise of a bright coaching career ahead. If this stint goes well for him, then there is every chance a Premier League job is on offer next season, even if it isn't at Old Trafford.",
      "He also fits more smoothly into a new structure at United. Solskjaer was more of a manager during his three years in charge, while Carrick is more of a coach, although there is a question as to how much this job is actually going to be about coaching. These players will relish returning to a simpler system after 14 months of looking lost under Amorim.",
      "Carrick will opt for a shape they all know and understand, and while he has more time on the training ground than most - too much, probably - it is unlikely he is going to seek to introduce complicated pressing structures or patterns of play to them. Ralf Rangnick tried that, after all.",
      "What is needed is a motivator who can pick the players up after a dismal run of form and a dramatic few weeks that have visibly stripped the group of confidence and belief. Heads have dropped and there aren't enough leaders on the pitch dragging them forward.",
      "Carrick can do that, as can his experienced assistant Steve Holland, who was a driving force behind the throne for England when working with Gareth Southgate. Whether they can deliver Carrick's possession-heavy template in what is left of the season remains to be seen.",
      "He might only have spent 10 days in charge as caretaker in 2021, but he delivered an upturn in results and United players liked the cut of his jib. His training was bright, and he earned credit for the way he stabilised a team that had just conceded four goals to Watford.",
      "Wins against Villarreal and Arsenal were impressive and Carrick's United were good value for a point at Stamford Bridge. It might only be three games, but he has earned a shot at the job ahead of Solskjaer.",
      "He might also be looking forward to an easier assignment or two. His first game in charge was a Champions League tie in Spain and his first four Premier League games will now be against Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City and Arsenal. If he is still unbeaten in two weeks' time, then Berrada and Wilcox will know for sure they have the right man.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo should get more chances at United under a coaching staff aware of his talents(Image: )",
      "Six months ago, Michael Carrick reflected on Kobbie Mainoo's situation at Manchester United and felt that all he was missing was a bit of luck. Show a bit of patience, and that break would arrive.",
      "Now, it has, in the form of Carrick taking over from Ruben Amorim until the end of the season. Mainoo has gone from a coach who had misgivings about him and playing a system that never suited him, to one who's made his thoughts on the midfielder clear and should have a role that is ideal for him.",
      "The next four-and-a-half months are significant for many people at United, from Carrick to the players, and up to Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada. But they are massive for Mainoo.",
      "Had Amorim not pressed the self-destruct button a couple of weeks ago, then the 20-year-old could have ended the month playing for Napoli in Serie A. Instead, he will stay at United, and now it feels like his future is back in his hands.",
      "The sacking of Amorim hasn't entirely wiped the slate clean. Mainoo has just 18 months left on his contract, and talks over an extension have stalled, leaving him as one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, on a deal he signed way back in February 2023.",
      "The chances of landing the kind of contract the academy graduate feels he deserves were slim to non-existent under Amorim, who handed him just 212 minutes of Premier League football this season, with none of them coming from the start. It felt like the clock was ticking towards an inevitable and sad conclusion.",
      "That has all changed in a couple of weeks. Mainoo was lacking rhythm when he started against Brighton in the FA Cup last weekend, but if he gets more chances under Carrick, that will return, and he can prove he is worthy of new terms. Carrick, speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents last July, certainly sounded like a fan of the youngster.",
      "“I’ve seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom to create and take the ball, and I think he’s got a massive future,” Carrick said. “I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience, and that little bit of a break again, which I’m sure he’ll get.\"",
      "Maybe he is the man to offer him a change in fortunes. Amorim always billed Mainoo's fight to get in the side as a battle with Bruno Fernandes, so it will be interesting to see if Carrick sees a midfield where both men can play.",
      "He is likely to set United up in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3 shape and there should be room for both. At Middlesbrough, Carrick marked himself out as someone who valued possession and his comments to Ferdinand suggest he sees Mainoo as more of a No. 8, someone who plays around the opposition's penalty area rather than his own.",
      "Mainoo also has an existing relationship with Carrick's assistant Steve Holland. The 55-year-old was Gareth Southgate's No. 2 and played a part in Mainoo's rapid rise to senior England recognition and his excellent form during Euro 2024, which culminated in him starting the final.",
      "That support and those familiar voices should be beneficial for the Stockport-born midfielder as he looks to get his United career back on track. Over the next few months, he has the chance to prove he is currently undervalued at Old Trafford and secure his long-term future at the club.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours for Wednesday, January 14.",
      "Michael Carrick has been named as the Reds' new interim head coach until the end of the season, as the club look to finish the second-half of the season strong with hopes of qualifying for European football in 2026/27. Elsewhere, a number of players have been linked with arrivals and exits at Old Trafford as the January transfer window heats up.",
      "Carrick has been given a 'deadline' to work out how Kobbie Mainoo fits into his plans going forward, as the midfielder remains aggrieved by a lack of playing time awarded by Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old is said to be looking for a move away from the north west should he fail to see more frequent opportunities to showcase his talents, with Napoli currently thought to be leading the race to secure him on loan.",
      "Elsewhere, the Reds have been linked with LDU Quito youngster, Ederson Castillo, as they look to plan for the future in the engine room. The 17-year-old Ecuadorian midfielder has been dubbed the 'new Moises Caicedo', and reports suggest United could snag him for as little as £4million.",
      "It is also reported that the Premier League giants have been in informal contact with Karim Adeyemi over the potential of a transfer, as rumours surrounding his exit from Borussia Dortmund start to spike once more.",
      "Stay up to date with the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours in our live blog below...",
      "Thanks for tuning in for the MEN's Manchester United transfer blog. Our live coverage has now come to a close, but you can continue to keep up to date with the latest headlines, rumours and gossip on our homepage, here.",
      "Manchester United's decision to part ways with Ruben Amorim last week means specific calls made during his tenure are now being reviewed. Marcus Rashford's exit to Barcelona is one of them.",
      "Rashford has not played for United since December 12, 2024. After being left out of the squad for the Manchester derby earlier that month, he joined Aston Villa on a six-month loan. An unfortunate injury meant he contributed to 10 goals in 17 appearances.",
      "In the summer, Amorim and the club decided to axe him from the first-team. After weeks of speculation, the 28-year-old moved to Barcelona on a season-long loan with an option to make the switch permanent for €30million (£26million) 12 months later.",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Ecuadorian youngster Ederson Castillo, according to BolaVip. The defensive midfielder has emerged as a target for United for when he turns 18 in 2027, having shown plenty of potential at just 17.",
      "Real Madrid are also claimed to be eyeing a deal, though rivals Barcelona have already offered him a trial and the potential to sign the wonderkid. A fee in the millions could be commanded for his signature, though it remains to be seen who could win the race in the months ahead.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United are stepping up their midfield interest ahead of the summer, with Alex Scott among the names linked with a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "That's according to TEAMtalk, who are reporting that Bournemouth are prepared to fight to keep hold of the 22-year-old, with United just one of several teams fighting for his signature.",
      "Rivals Man City, Aston Villa, Newcastle, and Tottenham have all been monitoring him in recent weeks, with just over two years remaining on his deal with the Cherries.",
      "Read more here",
      "Barcelona have reportedly held talks with Manchester United to assess their options for signing Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal this summer. The 28‑year‑old's loan spell is nearing its end, and the Spanish club are keen to make the move permanent - but there's a catch.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Barcelona are reluctant to activate Rashford's €30million (£26m) buy clause and instead, hope to negotiate a lower fee. It's said that a second loan, potentially with a conditional obligation, has also been discussed as an alternative.",
      "Further discussions are expected to take place closer to the end of the season as both clubs look to find a solution. United are keen to cash in on Rashford and believe the clause is reasonable, while Barcelona hold the advantage of the winger's desire to remain at Camp Nou.",
      "Read more here",
      "Michael Carrick may have precious little time to persuade Kobbie Mainoo to stay at Manchester United, if recent speculation proves accurate. The 44-year-old was confirmed as the Red Devils' interim manager on Tuesday evening, temporarily replacing Ruben Amorim who was dismissed earlier this month.",
      "While Carrick will be keen to steer United towards the best possible Premier League finish as the campaign's second-half unfolds, the former midfielder must also focus on building rapport with the squad he's inherited. One player Carrick would do well to prioritise is undoubtedly Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old endured limited opportunities under Amorim, starting just once this season under the Portuguese boss in a humiliating Carabao Cup tie against Grimsby Town, where United were knocked out on penalties. Although Darren Fletcher gave the youngster a chance in last weekend's FA Cup match against Brighton, supporters are anxious to discover Carrick's intentions for Mainoo.",
      "Read more here",
      "Turkish outfit Galatasaray are reportedly in talks to sign United midfielder Manuel Ugarte in the January transfer window, according to Turkish media outlet Haber Sarikirmizi. They claim that Galatasaray are hopeful about their chances of finalising a deal.",
      "Discussions are reportedly centred on a loan agreement with an option to purchase, which would free up the midfielder reported £150K per week wages. It's also been reported that Ugarte's Uruguayan teammates, Fernando Muslera and Lucas Torreira, have been persuading the midfielder to consider a move to Turkey.",
      "Journalist Yakup Cınar stated: \"The player will leave Manchester United 100%.\"",
      "Read more here",
      "United's Premier League rivals, West Ham, have reportedly entered the race for RB Leipzig defender El Chadaille Bitshiabu, according to Quotidiano Sportivo, casting further doubt over a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "United have been linked with the defender, but appear to face competition from several clubs. Leeds United, Bournemouth, AS Monaco and Lyon are also reportedly interested in the 20 year old.",
      "The defender has found regular game time hard to come by this season, making just three Bundesliga appearances. He returned from a hamstring injury as a late substitute in the 3-1 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen before Germany's winter break.",
      "Read more here",
      "According to The Guardian, Manchester United are prepared to provide Carrick with funds for the remainder of the January transfer window, with former Wolves captain Ruben Neves identified as a target, potentially available for around £20 million.",
      "While United are expected to hold off on pursuing midfield targets such as Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton until the summer, it is reported that the club is still willing to allocate funds for Carrick to bolster his squad before the window closes.",
      "Reports suggest that funds will be made available for a potential move for Neves, should the opportunity to sign him arise - or for other players on the club's shortlist.",
      "Read more here",
      "Michael Carrick's backroom staff at Manchester United has been confirmed following his appointment as head coach for the rest of the season.",
      "Jonny Evans returned to United to coach with Fletcher after stepping down from his role of head of loans and pathways last month. The former defender will continue to work as a first-team coach. Craig Mawson has been retained in his position as first-team goalkeeper coach.",
      "Travis Binnion was part of Fletcher's staff for his two games as caretaker and will continue to help Carrick as a first-team coach. Tom Curtis has stepped into Binnion's position as Under-21 lead",
      "Steve Holland has been appointed as Carrick's assistant manager. Jonathan Woodgate has also been appointed as first-team coach.",
      "AS Roma are reportedly considering keeping striker Evan Ferguson on loan until the end of the season amid uncertainty over a move for Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The Dutch forward arrived in Manchester in the summer of 2024, becoming the first signing under new minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Erik ten Hag was the manager when he joined from Bologna.",
      "The £36.5million striker struggled to make an impact under Ten Hag and saw limited game time off the bench under Ruben Amorim, before the Portuguese was sacked last week. Zirkzee has contributed just one assist for the Reds so far this season.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United youngster Ethan Wheatley will spend the second half of the season on loan at Bradford City.",
      "Wheatley made 20 starts for Northampton in the third division. United considered his loan a success, but he will now get the chance to be part of a promotion-chasing Bradford City side.",
      "Man United are the 'most interested' team in signing LDU star Ederson Castillo.",
      "BOLAVIP have claimed that United could make a move in January to secure his services. The 17-year-old is understood to be available for around £4m.",
      "Barcelona and Real Madrid are both also tracking him.",
      "Man United are one of the clubs in Europe considering a move for Roma's Mile Svilar.",
      "According to AS Roma Live, Chelsea, United and Tottenham are all prepared to get the deal done. Andre Onana is out on loan and Altay Bayindir is expected to leave in the summer.",
      "Bayern Munich are prepared to take control of the race to sign Elliot Anderson as they look to improve Vincent Kompany's midfield.",
      "Fichajes have reported that Bayern have started to do the groundwork to sign the Nottingham Forest star.",
      "RB Leipzig are plotting a move for Sassuolo centre-back Tarik Muharemovic, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United. Reports have claimed that United have scouted the 22-year-old for several months, but the German side are leading the race.",
      "Caught Offside have claimed that they are preparing a £22m bid for the defender.",
      "Barcelona want to sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent basis next summer, but don't want to pay the fee agreed as part of their option to buy.",
      "The loan deal includes a purchase option of around €30m. However, according to reports, Barcelona would rather sign him on a lower fee or agree another loan deal which would include an obligation at the end of next season.",
      "After reports in Spain claimed that Man United had made a £30m bid for Atletico Madrid's Marcos Llorente, it's now said that the La Liga said are unsure whether to cash in on him.",
      "Some at the club believe he is still a valuable playe, while others believe his age, 30, will only see his value drop over the next few seasons.",
      "The Daily Mail have reported that Kobbie Mainoo could still leave Manchester United on loan this month despite Michael Carrick's appointment.",
      "The 20-year-old is said to have a fragile relationship with the United hierarchy. Mainoo started just one game under Ruben Amorim and it's claimed he is desperate to play ahead of the World Cup.",
      "If he doesn't play, Mainoo could seek a loan move to Napoli.",
      "Good morning and welcome to the MEN's Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "Stick around for all of the latest news, rumours and updates as the January transfer window continues to develop!"

The 26-year-old was part of the club's 'bomb squad' alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, but those four all secured exits from Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "It was a permanent move to Chelsea for the latter with Antony re-joining Real Betis, Rashford signing for Barcelona on a season-long loan and Sancho making a temporary switch to Aston Villa. Malacia was primed for a deadline day move to Elche, but that collapsed at the eleventh hour.",
      "Despite being frozen and spending the following two months out of the team, the Dutchmen returned to the fold as an unused substitute for the 4-2 win over Brighton. He was named in the following six squads before coming on for the final two minutes against Newcastle United.",
      "Injured stars returning have resulted in him featuring for the under-21s and he scored in a 45-minute appearance for the developmental side against Wolves earlier this week. With his future unclear, Malacia is looking for clarity from Carrick before making a final decision, according to The Sun.",
      "He has entered the final few months of his contract at Old Trafford and as such, a winter window exit has not been ruled out. It has been claimed that there is interest in Malacia but none of those current options appeal to him.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has missed the last few months with injury(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Despite that, the club's former midfielder, who managed Middlesbrough for three years, is excited by the task that awaits him and several other ex-United stars.",

      "\"I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Patience could yet be key as Mainoo seems likely to remain in competition with Bruno Fernandes unless Carrick opts to use the England international in a midfield pairing, while Fernandes becomes United's No.10.",

Carrick was joined by his assistants Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, while first team coaches Jonny Evans, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson also got involved.",

      "Ex-England No.2 is Michael Carrick's new right-hand man at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "If Michael Carrick represents a gamble for Manchester United, then Steve Holland is the banker. It is such a shrewd move on United’s part to bring on Holland because he represents the tried and trusted, experienced and highly-respected No.2 in Carrick’s new backroom team.",
      "Carrick is still relatively inexperienced as a manager and appointing Holland could genuinely give him a chance of passing this five-month audition to get the job on a permanent basis. Holland is the senior figure in Carrick’s backroom staff of Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans, former youth coach Travis Binnion and keeper coach Craig Mawson.",
      "There are obvious parallels because, just like former England boss Gareth Southgate, Carrick managed Middlesbrough and cut his teeth under a strong, supportive chairman Steve Gibson. Southgate always spoke about Holland as if he was an equal. He ran every big decision by him and even talked about having a lunch together to discuss whether to quit before the 2022 World Cup. They stayed on. They were a package because that was how much faith and store Southgate put in his No.2.",
      "Holland, 55, spent six years at Chelsea working under the likes of Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez, Antonio Conte and Guus Hiddink. His playing career was curtailed by injury and he immediately set his sights on coaching. He is regarded as someone with an eye for detail, a diligent planner and former Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas said he has a “meticulous coaching brain.”",
      "He is very happy to be in the background and out of the limelight. A brief spell in charge at Crewe ended amid mixed messages about his role and he had a stint as caretaker at Chelsea.",
      "But this is a man who has never courted the limelight or been particularly comfortable in it. He did not seem to enjoy the rare occasions when he had to do press conferences at Chelsea.",
      "Back in Covid times, scouts would often sit in random places in near-empty stadiums. Holland ended up a few seats away from me in my seat at an Arsenal game. I could tell he was not hugely impressed to look across and see me being the closest person sat to him in the stadium.",
      "Next time we saw each other there was a bit of small talk and he would pass the time of day if you saw him around an England camp. But generally there is this cliche about coaches being the conduit and the nice guy to the touch manager.",
      "Steve Holland speaks to Gareth Southgate during Euro 2024(Image: Getty Images)",
      "With Southgate and Holland, it was role reversal. Southgate was the likeable, friendly face whereas Holland was happy to be in the background. He is serious and intense.",
      "His reputation on the training ground is far more important, of course. Players talk about good, well-thought out sessions and he is strong on tactics and planning.",
      "He is fiercely secretive. He hates any details getting out and, for example, the theory was always he was more sensitive about the opposition having any clue about England’s tactics and the line-up than Southgate. But if you look at his CV, the managers he has worked under, this is a manager with a stellar reputation. He will bring gravitas to Carrick’s coaching staff.",
      "Younger managers often bring in older heads and this is a shrewd move by Carrick. He could not have done better than Holland.",
      "It is also a reason why, if things go well in the next few months, Carrick will feel as if he has a genuine chance of being a long term United option.",

      "Darren Fletcher deserves credit for his work at Manchester United last week(Image: )",
      "There was the slightest hint of a crack in Darren Fletcher's voice as he spoke for the final time as Manchester United's caretaker head coach. Although Fletcher had just revealed he had been told to report to Carrington on Monday morning, he would have known his time in the hot seat was up.",
      "You could see how much it had hurt him not to be able to deliver a victory. A Premier League draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat to Brighton was the kind of ending Fletcher didn't deserve, and it pained him to come to terms with that.",
      "\"I've given it my best, and ultimately, I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result,\" he said. \"But I feel like there were some good things in there, created a lot of chances, shots, things like that.",
      "\"Ultimately, it wasn't enough. I am more disappointed than anybody really because I care for the club and I want the club to do well.\"",
      "Fletcher was spoken of as a candidate for the job until the end of the season and spoke to chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox at Carrington. However, he always knew this was a two-game deal and that the powerbrokers preferred experience to see them through until the end of the campaign.",
      "When Michael Carrick's appointment was confirmed, Fletcher was offered the chance to stay on the first-team staff but opted for a return to his role as head coach of the Under-18s. He has had a spell as technical director at Old Trafford and been on the coaching staff, but taking charge of the age-group side offers the chance to continue his development as a head coach.",
      "And whatever the results last week, he has shown enough around Carrington and within games to suggest that he has a bright future in that department and that he is someone United should look to nurture over the next few years. United officials were said to be impressed by the way he conducted himself and rate him very highly.",
      "Certainly, the performance against Burnley was encouraging. United had 30 shots and drew a game they should have won handsomely. It was one of the best attacking displays they have produced all season.",
      "Fletcher was disappointed not to get a win during his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "Fletcher certainly spoke like a United boss and he carried himself with class and dignity. He was open and engaging in his press conferences, particularly his first one, when he made all the right noises and said all the right things. That he had switched by Sunday night to delivering a slightly harsher critique of the players and demanding they now step up showed he got the tone right when required.",
      "One particularly memorable moment is the smile he flashed when told of comments he had made as a pundit in 2018, when Jose Mourinho was sacked and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in as a caretaker. Fletcher has said, \"They're almost writing off this season\". As the quotes were read back to him, he could see what was coming.",
      "“Good research, that! I was young and naive when I said that, wasn’t I?\" he joked.",
      "“That was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in the context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.\"",
      "Fletcher handled a potential grenade with warmth and humour, and it was diffused with relative ease. It was a far cry from the fireworks that often emanated from a Ruben Amorim press conference.",
      "But being sure-footed with the media and sounding like a United manager are irrelevant if you can't deliver. Strip away the results, and Fletcher's two dealings with United players marked out his ability as a man-manager.",
      "First of all, he took Benjamin Sesko aside at Carrington on his first day in the job. He had no prior relationship with the £73million summer signing and wanted to get to know him, but he was aware his confidence needed a lift as well after two goals in 17 games under Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese had been critical of Sesko at times and only days earlier had refuted a suggestion that his teammates needed to be better at finding his runs. Fletcher showed the 22-year-old videos of his movement and assured him the goals would come if that continues. He also contradicted Amorim and told the striker his teammates did have a responsibility to find him.",
      "Fletcher got a tune out of Sesko, who scored three goals in his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "It came together immediately at Turf Moor, when Sesko scored twice and could have had more. He scored again on Sunday and a return of 13 shots in two games showed Fletcher had got him back on track and Carrick will be grateful for that.",
      "Then there is Shea Lacey. Amorim had shown little desire to trust youth at Old Trafford, especially young attacking talents, and Lacey was restricted to six minutes off the bench despite being named as a substitute in eight games. In seven of them, he didn't get on, despite United chasing goals against Everton, West Ham, Wolves and Leeds.",
      "Fletcher used the 18-year-old twice, for six minutes at Turf Moor and then for 27 against Brighton. He showed trust in a player he clearly rates and the instructions he gave him against Burnley resulted in a dazzling cameo in which he was unlucky not to score.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" Fletcher said. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless and he hit the crossbar and he had another shot so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there's a lot of injuries in recent years and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future, I've no doubt it's about that.\"",
      "It was exactly what Lacey needed to hear after being underused by Amorim and the confidence boost did the trick. Those examples show that judging Fletcher just on the results last week doesn't tell us the full story.",

      "Carrick has been appointed United interim boss(Image: )",
      "A new year but some very famliar faces at Manchester United. 13 days into 2026 and there have already been three different men at the helm of England's biggest club. Michael Carrick is the latest to occupy the Old Trafford hotseat, with former interim boss Darren Fletcher moving back to his role as Under-18 coach.",
      "Including interim bosses, seven different managerial appointments have been made at Old Trafford in little over four years, a list bookended by Carrick. There's every chance an eighth will be added come the summer, but for now it is Carrick who will have the chance to show his credentials.",
      "A manager sacked by Championship side Middlesbrough just seven months ago was always going to jump at the chance to manage United, but the fixture list has thrown up something of a hospital pass for Carrick. A Manchester derby followed by a trip to the league leaders leaves no time for him to settle in. United need a spark and with the halfway point of the Premier League season disappearing in the rear-view mirror they need one fast.",
      "But anyone looking for a crumb of comfort as United look to navigate their way through yet another period of crisis need only look at Carrick's previous spells as a manager.",
      "Solskjaer waved goodbye at Vicarage Road in November 2021, having won just 3 of his previous 11 games, yet Carrick's promotion to interim boss saw an immediate upturn in results with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal sandwiched by a creditable draw away at Chelsea. While it's a small sample size to work with, the way in which United's season unravelled under Ralf Rangnick and the turbulence prior to Carrick's appointment shines a light on the impressive work he did in such a short time.",
      "He enjoyed a similar new-manager bounce during his time at Middlesbrough. Defeat in his opening game was followed by a run of 15 wins from 19 league games, with relegation worries exchanged for promotion hopes in a matter of months.",
      "From a team that looked lost under Chris Wilder, suddenly Boro were on an upward trajectory. The atmosphere at the Riverside was electric and there was a real sense of unity between players and fans, something that had been missing for far too long. Middlesbrough's Chuba Akpom finished as top scorer in the division and was named Championship Player of the Season, with Boro finishing in fourth - not bad for a team embroiled in a relegation battle when Carrick arrived.",
      "Unfortunately for Carrick, he was unable to build on what had been a superb start to life at the Riverside. Defeat in the play-offs in 2022/23 was followed by near misses in the next two seasons, and it was clear the former midfielder had reached the end of the road on Teesside last summer.",
      "Opposition sides became wise to Boro's play, with no real urgency to their attack and a manager who struggled to impact matches with in-game changes.",
      "United fans may shudder reading that, given what went before Carrick, but the impact he made at Boro in such a short space of time cannot be ignored.",
      "If United want a manager who can pick a dressing room up and spark an upturn in results, then they might just have the right man. Should that scenario come to pass, the real question will be what they do in the summer.",
      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022 and became Head of Football in August 2024.",

      "Carrick's first game in charge of United will be Saturday's Manchester derby, before he takes charge of the final 16 games of the Premier League season. With no domestic cup competitions to compete for, the objective is to seal Champions League football for next season.",
      "It's understood that United will only strengthen Carrick's squad on two conditions. The first being if long-term targets become available, and if they need to prevent other teams from taking pole position to sign a player they are monitoring.",
      "A long list of players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, predominantly midfielders. The position is a priority at Old Trafford with Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba all on their radar. Still, it is expected that any move will be made until the end of the season.",
      "Ruben Neves' contract at Al-Hilal expires in June 2026 and he is a real target for Manchester United this month(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Yet there are a couple of deals that could materialise this window due to the two conditions set and the opportunity in the market. When Carrick takes charge of United, his strongest team will welcome the arrival of two players.",
      "Starting in goal, Senne Lammens is the first choice, and that isn't changing. With Carrick expected to bring his 4-2-3-1 style of play to Old Trafford, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez are all options at centre-back.",
      "However, Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi is available after deciding not to renew his contract. The Argentine's current deal expires in the summer, meaning he is free to agree a pre-contract with clubs in Europe.",
      "Marcos Senesi's contract at Bournemouth is due to expire at the end of the season(Image: AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images)",
      "That doesn't rule out United striking this month, and the prospect of losing him for nothing is likely to force Bournemouth to accept an offer. At 30, the centre-back improves United's backline and would fit into Carrick's back four with no trouble.",
      "Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu will contend for the left-back role, with the former impressing this season upon returning to full fitness. At right-back, Noussair Mazraoui's absence due to AFCON has been telling with Diogo Dalot underperforming.",
      "The midfield pivot is the big question mark, and Carrick will give each player a clean canvas. Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo are the three natural central midfielders, but there are concerns. Casemiro's presence leaves United lacking legs, and Ugarte's adaptation to England has been a struggle.",
      "Mainoo would be many people's first choice in midfield, and there are worries over his partner. The bargain deal to sign Ruben Neves, understood to be around £20million, would crush that trouble.",
      "The Al-Hilal midfielder, like Senesi, is in the final six months of his contract in Saudi Arabia and has previously turned down extension offers. United previously wanted Neves before his move away from Wolves, and at £20m, he would be the ideal midfielder improvement for Carrick.",
      "Carrick has a fortune of riches in the final third with United's strongest position by some distance. Captain Bruno Fernandes is a guarantee in the No. 10 position; it's his best position, and there isn't a better option.",
      "Bruno Fernandes will be a key player in Michael Carrick's tenure at the club(Image: 2020 Getty Images)",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad will both return from AFCON in time for United's clash against Manchester City, adding some much-needed firepower to the final third. Since signing from Brentford in the summer, Mbeumo has scored six goals in the Premier League and has often been United's most dangerous player.",
      "For Amad, his versatility means he is within a shout of playing in several positions. The left-wing role will see one of Amad or Matheus Cunha start, both players having their strengths and weaknesses that make it a tough decision for Carrick.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the default option at centre-forward after United coughed up £74m for him in the summer. After a difficult opening five months in England, the striker has still scored five goals, including three in the last two games.",
      "Away from the strongest XI, Carrick has good options off the bench. Dorgu, Dalot and Yoro all offer quality in defence when required, as do Casemiro and Ugarte. In attack, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount have both proved they can make a difference when called upon and Shea Lacey's emergence provides the excitement fans want to see.",
      "Carrick's strongest potential United XI (4-2-3-1): Lammens; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Senesi, Shaw; Neves, Mainoo; Mbeumo, Fernandes, Cunha; Sesko.",

      "Michael Carrick is the favourite to take the caretaker reins at Old Trafford(Image: Photo by Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are preparing to enter yet another new era as the club searches for a permanent replacement for Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese gaffer was given the boot after just 14 months at the helm and Darren Fletcher has been given the interim manager responsibilities for the time being.",
      "Michael Carrick is currently the favourite to take the caretaker role at United, with club chiefs hoping to have a new boss in place when players return to training on Wednesday. What can United fans expect from their former star midfielder should he be the man to get the nod?",
      "His most recent managerial job with Middlesbrough will give fans a decent idea of what's to come from the Englishman, should he be appointed. Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough in June 2025 after two-and-a-half years in charge.",
      "The ex-England international had guided the club to the Championship play-offs in 2022/2023 but ultimately, his time was up. Teesside Live reporter Craig Johns is someone who can provide an accurate summary of Carrick's time at Riverside Stadium.",
      "Speaking to the MEN, Johns revealed what it was like when Carrick came on board at TS3. \"Boro had a decent squad for the division but sat 21st after a poor start to the campaign under a disillusioned Chris Wilder,\" explained Johns. \"The players were very short on confidence at that time. With that in mind, hiring Carrick felt like a risk.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"There was respect and appreciation for who he is and the playing career he enjoyed. But there was, it’s fair to say, concern that it was a big risk to hire a young coach for his first job when the club were in that position.",
      "\"Nevertheless, Boro fans, like most, will get behind anyone once they’re in post. Away at Wigan, as it became clear he would be getting the job, they were already singing his name.\"",
      "So the early concerns aside, how did Carrick's side actually play football? Amorim stubbornly stuck to his 3-4-3 at Old Trafford, a bold system in modern day football, but Fletcher has reverted back to a flat back four. What could we see from Carrick, should he take on the role?",
      "Michael Carrick could be in the hot seat at Old Trafford(Image: Photo by Matthew Lewis/Getty Images)",
      "\"Carrick played a possession-based style of football,\" continued Johns. \"Which focused on playing out from the back and progressing through the pitch. Generally, it was a 4-2-3-1 formation with the number ten being a link player and the left-sided forward given freedom to roam and float inside, which created space down the left flank for the left-back to get forward. In turn, on the right, the right-sided defender would typically sit and create a back three to guard against transitions.",
      "\"When the quality was there, they were playing with confidence and there was space to exploit, it was a really attractive brand that delivered results and plenty of goals. But at times it was a little too slow and predictable and, towards the end, teams found it too easy to get men behind the ball, limit the space to exploit and frustrate Boro.\"",
      "One of Carrick's strongest areas, according to Johns, was improving individual quality.",
      "\"As for improving players, it was generally one of the better aspects of his time at the club,\" he said. \"He improved numerous players and, certainly in that first season after arriving, his calm and warming demeanor saw players quickly regain their confidence and go on an excellent run from 21st to finishing fourth and making the play-offs.",

      "Another strong point of Carrick's was being an \"excellent man manager\", says Johns, lauding the 44-year-old's ability to manage personalities as well as develop skills.",
      "\"Fundamentally, he’s a coach,\" said Johns. \"He loves being out on the training pitch and working with the players on development. Most players regarded him as an excellent man manager.\"",
      "But the negative side of Carrick's tenure - in-game management - contributed to his downfall. \"Particularly concerning was the amount of times Boro led in games only to throw it away in second halves,\" said Johns. \"In-game management was seen as a particular weakness.",
      "\"All too often, the opposition would make changes and Carrick wouldn’t react quickly enough to the momentum switch as it unfolded. He was reactive rather than proactive, and often too late. They dropped so many points from winning positions.\"",
      "Despite the in-game management aspect, there are plenty of positives to take from Carrick's time at Middlesbrough for United fans - particularly his ability to manage players, which will be important at a star-studded club like United.",
      "Another element that could help Carrick is his understanding of United as a club, the culture and knowing what fans want, as Johns concludes. \"For what Manchester United want in this moment, I actually think it’s an appointment that could work,\" he said. \"Their players would seemingly suit his preferred style, and he’s already worked with quite a few of them and, it appeared, had their respect.",
      "\"If he can deliver the same kind of uplift he did when first arriving at Boro, it’ll be exactly what Manchester United need until the end of the season. An arm-around-the-shoulder approach to boost confidence after what appeared a rather cold head coach in Ruben Amorim could be exactly the same as following Wilder at Boro.",
      "\"Being a Manchester United legend, you’d imagine he’ll unite everyone in and out of the club, and will understand the ethos and the ‘United way’, which Amorim just didn’t do.",
      "\"On top of that, all the criticisms I’ve given of him for his time at Boro, I think it’s only fair to nuance that by reminding, this was his first head coach role. When in the middle of the fire, you maybe don’t get a chance to be as reflective as is maybe needed to recognise the mistakes you’re making.\"",

      "Ratcliffe may have to take cover.(Image: )",
      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe secured a minority stake at Manchester United, he stressed his regime would need time to put things right. Everyone knew it would not be a quick fix, but Ratcliffe said that it would be fair to judge him after two or three seasons in charge of football operations.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “So, the message to the fans… I think absolutely our priority with Manchester United is performance on the pitch. So we want Manchester United to be challenging for the Premier League, challenging for the Champions League. That's what Manchester United is about.",
      "“It's the greatest club in the world, so it should be playing the greatest football in the world. But it's not a light switch. We can't just switch a switch and, all of a sudden, United are going to be playing football at the level of Real Madrid because they haven't been for the last 11 years. That takes time and patience.",
      "“The important thing is, I think, that we all observe the trajectory of Manchester United over the next two or three seasons, and the trajectory has to be in a good direction. I think that's how we should be measured.",
      "“I would ask for a bit of patience, but ultimately, you know, the performance of the club does sit on our shoulders. My shoulders particularly, but also Dave Brailsford, who's going to be intimately involved, and the rest of the people at the club obviously. And we need to take the rough with the smooth.",
      "“If we're successful that's fine. I think it would be nice to get a pat on the back for that. But if we're not successful, then it's on our shoulders. So, we fully accept that responsibility and we're going to be very, very focused on doing all the things that we can, as well as we can, to turn Manchester United into a winning side again.\"",
      "The Ineos regime's first big decision ahead of Ratcliffe's first full season as co-owner was to address Erik ten Hag's future. The Dutchman's contract was extended when overwhelming evidence indicated he should have been sacked.",
      "After the Dutchman departed, Ruud van Nistelrooy took over on an interim basis before Ruben Amorim was appointed. United paid around £11million to release him from his contract at Sporting, but Amorim lasted just 14 months in charge and received a £10m compensation package when he was axed.",
      "Ratcliffe's regime has thrown around millions while hitting fans' pockets.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Dan Ashworth departed shortly after Amorim's appointment. It was said there were \"too many cooks in the kitchen (boardroom)\", and there was an internal clash over Ten Hag's successor. United paid a combined £14.5m to sack Ten Hag, his backroom staff and Ashworth.",
      "Ratcliffe is about to hire another interim coach in his second full season in charge of football operations, with Michael Carrick now the leading candidate to oversee the rest of the campaign.",
      "United exited the Carabao Cup and FA Cup at the first opportunity, meaning they will play 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years. The season could become bleak if United fall into the bottom half of the table in the next few weeks and lose pace with the Champions League places.",
      "Ratcliffe oversaw the worst season at Old Trafford in 51 years last term. The British billionaire wanted to be different to the Glazers, but the results on the pitch have actually got worse, not better.",
      "The mess has spread beyond the pitch. Ratcliffe needed to lower the employee count, which was the highest in the Premier League, but the extent of the redundancies was brutal. That was the start of an assault on the club's identity: ticket prices have soared, and the penny pinching has known no bounds.",
      "Ratcliffe axed the annual £40,000 donation to the Association of Former Manchester United Players, which was set up in 1985 to support its 300-plus members, who represented the club in the years before huge wages. Gary Neville sat down with Ratcliffe last year and grilled him on the issue.",
      "He said: \"That’s not the players that played under Sir Alex, or even the last ten years. They’re players from the 60s and 70s. Why not raise the money at a dinner? Give the ex-players their money. It’s a cruel decision.”",
      "Ratcliffe responded \"nobody has suggested that because I would have supported that\", in a comical scene that wouldn't have looked out of place in the political satire British television series 'The Thick of It'.",
      "The truth is Ratcliffe has talked a good game, but he looks out of his depth. The Ineos team was supposed to be 'best in class', yet they have made decisions reminiscent of the previous regime.",
      "Ratcliffe said it was fair to judge him after two seasons. As it happens, those two seasons could be the worst campaigns at Old Trafford for decades. It's little wonder a fresh protest will take place before Fulham.",

      "Carrick is the leading contender for the interim job.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "Four years after stepping down as Manchester United caretaker and declining the chance to coach alongside Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick is preparing for another crack at the job.",
      "Carrick has emerged as the frontrunner for the interim position for the remainder of the season after impressing during his interview. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also been in contention for the role and United are expected to formally announce who will assume the position in the next 48 hours.",
      "\"It's Carrick, you know, it's hard to believe it's not Scholes,\" was aired at Turf Moor last week. United fans are disillusioned with Ineos' decision-making, and they are set to protest against the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe before facing Fulham, but Carrick is guaranteed to receive strong support from matchgoers.",
      "The former midfielder is hugely popular and only enhanced his reputation during his caretaker stint, in which he oversaw wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw against Chelsea. Rangnick was appointed as interim to oversee the second half of 2021/22, and Carrick declined the opportunity to continue as part of his coaching staff, partly out of loyalty to Solskjaer.",
      "“It is 100% my decision,” Carrick said at the time. “I respect a new manager coming in. I made the decision before speaking to him. It wasn’t an easy one but [it is the] right decision for the club. The loyalty to Ole is a little bit of a factor, but there were a lot of things that came into my decision.",
      "“I was conscious of making my decision before any real conversations with Ralf. It was nothing personal at all. He’s got a good group of players to work with. I’m proud of the players over the past three games. I just told them and they were a bit shocked and surprised, a bit emotional in the changing room.”",
      "Carrick was asked what he would do next. “I can honestly say I’ve given it no thought. Take the kids to school then we’ll see,” he said. “My time at this great club will always rank as the best years of my career.”",
      "Carrick has unfinished business at United.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "In management, what Carrick did next was take the Middlesbrough job in his native north east. He guided Boro to the play-offs in 2022/23, but was sacked in June 2025 after eighth and tenth place finishes.",
      "Carrick worked with limited resources at Middlesbrough, who have played just one season in the Premier League since their relegation in 2009, and it felt like his tenure had run its course.",
      "There is a feeling that Carrick has unfinished business at Old Trafford. And he should give himself a pat on the back for declining to work with Rangnick in 2021, as he wouldn't have been considered for the job in 2026 if he'd been part of the German's disastrous coaching staff that season.",
      "Carrick decided to walk away from a campaign that was about to unravel with Rangnick in charge. The irony is that he could walk into Carrington with this season threatening to unfold in the same manner.",
      "The 41-year-old's first game if he lands the job will be against Manchester City, followed by a trip to Arsenal. It doesn't get much trickier than playing the Premier League's pacesetters.",
      "United could slip into the bottom half of the table if results don't go their way. They have already exited the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, and the campaign would become bleak if hopes of securing Champions League football are dashed before mid-February. Carrick will be desperate to make a quick impact.",
      "Carrick dropped Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge.(Image: 2021 Getty Images)",
      "He is a winner and was popular among players during his coaching stint, which should help him. Bruno Fernandes was a close ally and will act as a sounding board if Carrick is formally announced.",
      "The Newcastle-born boss has demonstrated his ability to make big decisions, which is another plus. Carrick had the courage to drop Cristiano Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge in December 2021 and intelligently disarmed the media when he played down the significance of the decision after that game.",
      "\"I didn't see it as being a major decision,\" he said. \"It certainly wasn't within the camp or group. We all got on really well. The game went well to an extent and it wasn't a drama at all.\"",
      "It's those kinds of decisions that a United manager must make with conviction to be successful. Carrick is not afraid to axe players from the team and he should be able to give the current crop a kick up the backside.",
      "United looked like they needed a jolt against Brighton last weekend. Darren Fletcher described the group as \"fragile\", and a club source recently questioned the mentality of those in the dressing room.",
      "Carrick was part of various United dressing rooms over the years with no concerns about mentality. He will need every bit of his coaching experience to secure a spot in the Champions League this season.",

      "Dalot reacted after the FA Cup defeat.(Image: MUTV)",
      "Diogo Dalot believes Manchester United must improve their defensive record. United crashed out of the FA Cup on Sunday evening after losing 2-1 against Brighton at Old Trafford. The defeat means United will play 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years.",
      "Michael Carrick is the leading candidate to take interim charge of the team for the remainder of the season, and the former midfielder will try to steer the club into the Champions League places. United have conceded 36 goals in all competitions this season. The Reds have recorded just two clean sheets in the Premier League, and Dalot believes the defensive record is a clear area for improvement.",
      "Speaking after the Brighton defeat, he told MUTV: \"Really difficult to take. The last couple of games, you try to find ways to win the game, and I think we did enough to win, but in the end, it's really frustrating because in the second half, we gave them so few chances to score goals, and we created enough to win, and we controlled the game.\"",
      "When it was put to Dalot that United continue to concede goals despite conceding few shots on target, he said: \"I think that's something we have to look at. We are in the phase where every attack they have is a threat to us, we are conceding so few shots on target.",
      "\"But we concede one goal at least every game. I still believe we're going to score every game. We are a threat, but when it's time to defend, we need more urgency as a team.\"",
      "Carrick is expected to land the interim job, which means his first game in charge will be against Manchester City this weekend. City are winless in their last three league games but are still in second position.",
      "\"Not just the leaders, but the whole group,\" said Dalot about how United must respond. \"You have to find ways to overcome this, to find energy between each other to come to training, be professional and prepare for a big game.\"",
      "United will be boosted by the return of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo for the Manchester derby. The pair will be available for the first time since reporting to the Africa Cup of Nations with their respective nations.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",

      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",

      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",

      "And while the change will be a welcome relief to the fans and many of the players, Parker believes Yoro will struggle when not playing alongside two other centre-backs.",
      "“I think Yoro struggles in Carrick’s system, I really do,” Parker told Metro. “I haven’t seen anything yet on a consistent basis. I’ve seen more consistency from (Ayden) Heaven than what I have from Yoro.",
      "“I think the back five covered him in the wide area. He had that little bit of cover in there. But I’ve seen him in a four, and once he’s exposed, he looks like he’s treading water all the time.",
      "“He’s not the quickest, not the greatest of athletes. And I just look at what I saw against Brighton, and it’s a concern.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’.",
      "Carrick was finally appointed Manchester United manager on a deal up to the end of the season in the aftermath of Ruben Amorim’s sacking earlier this month.",
      "In what has been called a ‘close-run’ race between Carrick and Solskjaer, the former won for a variety of reasons, as predictably detailed by the numerous inside stories published since.",
      "They explain how director of football Jason Wilcox told the players that Champions League qualification was their target for the remainder of the season – they were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton days later so good work – and that He Knows The Club was indeed their bar for caretaker consideration.",
      "Wilcox made first contact with Carrick and Solskjaer over the phone on Tuesday, conducted face-to-face meetings with them on Thursday and Saturday respectively, then relayed the club’s decision the following week.",
      "Ruud van Nistelrooy, bless him, was interviewed over the phone and promptly rejected.",
      "All three ‘impressed’ but Carrick was, as phrased by many writers, the ‘unanimous choice’ in the end.",
      "But much like in the hours after Amorim’s demise, a great many journalists with contacts in and around Old Trafford have shared what went down in that fateful week leading up to Carrick’s anointment.",
      "",
      "Roy Keane might well have sensed “a bad smell” emanating from the halls of Carrington in the week of Amorim’s dismissal, for Sir Alex Ferguson had a degree of involvement from the off in deciding the Portuguese’s successor.",
      "Rob Dawson and Mark Ogden of ESPN write that Ferguson was called to ‘a breakfast meeting’ with Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada two days after Amorim was sacked, which ‘set the course’ for Carrick’s eventual coronation.",
      "Ferguson ‘was invited into the training ground to give his verdict on the manager search,’ with Wilcox a source adding:",
      "“Omar and Jason spoke to Sir Alex. They met over breakfast to discuss three guys who had all played under him in the past. Some might criticize that, so you can’t win. But Sir Alex knows Michael, Ole and Ruud better than anyone, so Omar and Jason canvassed his opinion.”",
      "The ESPN pair add that it is not known ‘whether Ferguson directly anointed Carrick as his favoured choice,’ but the Scot is described as ‘wholly positive about his former midfielder and fully supports his appointment’.",
      "Four Athletic writers team up, however, to say that of the final choices Solskjaer and Carrick, Ferguson is ‘known to have favoured the latter’s candidacy’.",
      "Carrick will be giving him a call soon.",
      "",
      "If the many reports are to be believed, Ferguson might well prescribe to a widespread notion summed up by the oft-cited difference between Carrick and Solskjaer, as summed up by one phrase: ‘more hands-on’.",
      "ESPN, The Athletic and BBC Sport all use that wording to explain in part how Carrick edged ahead of Solskjaer in the race.",
      "Sami Mokbel of the BBC says that the idea Carrick ‘arguably provides greater hands-on coaching expertise than Solskjaer was at the heart’ of Manchester United’s decision.",
      "The general vibes-based approach of Solskjaer was a ‘key consideration’ in the early stages of the process as the desperation to ‘inspire a squad so clearly in need of a pick-me-up’ was identified, but Carrick’s general coaching acumen ‘ultimately became one of the overriding factors behind the decision’.",
      "Another tick for Carrick was his willingness to operate within the Manchester United power structure, which basically means he is fine getting daily texts off Wilcox and Ratcliffe with tactical ideas based on Gary Neville’s latest podcast.",
      "‘He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.’",
      "That greater understanding of the current squad is echoed by other outlets as another advantage Carrick held over Solskjaer, who presumably asked where Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard were.",
      "The well-connected Rich Fay says Carrick’s ‘strong knowledge of the players’ at his disposal was a positive, with the Athletic appraising his ‘pre-existing knowledge of the squad’.",
      "We simply must know who Solskjaer thinks is still there.",
      "Carrick’s philosophy also ‘aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play,’ according to Dorsett and Khan, who say there was ‘a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable’.",
      "Mokbel touts a reported switch to a 4-2-3-1 formation, adding that ‘it also has not gone unnoticed by United chiefs’ that Carrick ‘oversaw a transition from a three-at-the-back system deployed by predecessor Chris Wilder’.",
      "And when Carrick ‘outlined his vision for the remainder of the campaign’, Wilcox and Berrada were described as ‘impressed by those plans, as well as Carrick’s enthusiasm for taking on the role,’ according to Mark Critchley and others of The Athletic.",
      "",
      "In some ways it was a race Solskjaer lost as much as one Carrick won.",
      "It is claimed by numerous outlets that the Norwegian was eager to discuss a more permanent arrangement. The Athletic say his ‘preference would have been to take the job again on a permanent basis, working for the long term’ on ‘a major rebuild’.",
      "But another phrase which crops up regularly in these insides stories is ‘backwards step’; Solskjaer’s three-year reign at Old Trafford seemed to count as much against him as for in the end.",
      "Carrick, however, expressed a ‘willingness to take on the role with no guarantee’ of anything beyond the end of the season.",
      "One of Solskjaer’s biggest issues was the composition of his backroom staff. The Athletic call that a ‘stumbling block’ considering his last assistants at Old Trafford were Carrick and current Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna, neither of whom would be prepared to back him up this time around.",
      "That was especially pertinent, as this line from Mokbel makes clear of Solskjaer:",
      "‘It is also acknowledged that much of the coaching during his reign was completed by Carrick and McKenna, who were his assistants.’",
      "One last obstacle for Solskjaer is presented by Pete Hall of The I Paper, who points out that ‘in the eyes of Ineos’ power brokers’, Carrick ‘has more recent experience in the dugout’ than Solskjaer, whose only spell since leaving Manchester United in November 2021 – a seven-month reign ended by his sacking at Besiktas in August – ‘was not the kind of experience needed to steady a sinking ship’.",
      "",
      "With complete deference and humility, of course.",
      "Solskjaer – along with Van Nistelrooy – was informed by Wilcox of the decision on Tuesday and, if an ESPN source is to be believed, “took the news like a gentleman”.",
      "The Athletic say Solskjaer was ‘naturally disappointed’ but remains ‘fully supportive of Carrick’. And even ‘carved out a few hours’ during the search ‘to go to the cinema and watch Marty Supreme’.",
      "That is pure, uncut Athletic inside story long read.",
      "",
      "In a word: no.",
      "But there were those within Manchester United who were left ‘suspecting’ that a concerted effort was being made ‘to push his name through the press and social media,’ in the words of The Athletic.",
      "They immediately clarify that there was no suggestion such a drive actually came from Solskjaer, who himself was ‘personally baffled by suggestions that he was keen to take the role before he had even been approached about it’.",
      "Solskjaer felt ‘he had the support of Wilcox and Berrada’ but less ‘backing from the club’s ownership’ in the Glazer family and Ratcliffe.",
      "Manchester United, for their part, ‘insist that at no point did anybody within the ownership challenge Wilcox’s recommendation to appoint Carrick,’ because why would you challenge a man who has just sacked his last recommendation after 14 months and hundreds of millions of pounds being spent?",
      "",
      "The current candidates range from unoriginal to unexciting and unlikely.",
      "It is fairly obvious that at some point Wilcox will stop “interfering” and simply take the reins himself.",
      "But who will inherit Carrick’s Manchester United and lead them into next season?",
      "There is a deeply Championship Manager-influenced belief that with this being a major international tournament year, the list of the best available managers will be further boosted in the summer once the World Cup is finished and every nation besides the winner has done away with their coach in a massive panic.",
      "It worked with Louis van Gaal so yeah, crack on.",
      "Thomas Tuchel is thrown into the ring by The I’s Hall, the German having ‘cropped up in several conversations’ with ‘a feeling that after the World Cup’ he will seek ‘a fresh challenge’.",
      "Fabrizio Romano corroborates the very idea Manchester United want him, but Tuchel might be harder to convince.",
      "On a similar note, Richard Jolly of The Independent crops up with a delightful clarification: Steve Holland’s arrival as part of Carrick’s staff ‘is not, United insist, a prelude to bringing in Gareth Southgate’.",
      "But the former England No.2 ‘was suggested by the club’ as someone who could work closely with Carrick and help him ease into such a pressured role. So Michael Owen ought to be ignored as Sir Gareth takes to the Manchester United throne in June.",
      "Over at Sky, Dorsett and Khan provide a helpful list of options in Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique and Marco Silva.",
      "It remains to be seen who of those the great overseer Ferguson will recommend.",
      "The centre-back ‘covered’ under Amorim is not a good enough ‘athlete’ to thrive under Carrick and is set to be ‘exposed’ in his Man Utd system.",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",
      "There is, to nobody’s great surprise, a lot of nonsense about Michael Carrick’s first day in his new job as Manchester United interim manager.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",
      "Man Utd legend Jaap Stam has outlined what the Red Devils should be looking for in their next permanent manager after sacking Ruben Amorim.",
      "Xabi Alonso is available and will have No Shortage Of Suitors. But where will he end up? We’ve ranked the main contenders, from Man United to Liverpool."

      "Unsurprisingly there is a vast torrent of guff to navigate in light of Michael Carrick’s appointment as Manchester United interim boss.",
      "Without giving too many spoilers away, we now live in a world where people are apparently surprised to discover mornings can be quite dark in northern England during January.",
      "Plus there’s all the usual transfer boosts and scaremongering and all such tishes and fipsies.",
      "",
      "Unusual for The Sun, usually a more calm and thoughtful voice in these troubled times, to claim this prize but they’ve smashed it out of the park here.",
      "The story? New Man United interim boss Michael Carrick gave his assistant Jonathan Woodgate a lift to Man United training this morning.",
      "The headline?",
      "DAWN RAID",
      "We spent longer than we care to admit desperately scouring those eight apparently wildly overexcited letters to try and find the cheeky bit of harmless wordplay concealed within and drew a blank.",
      "Luckily the standfirst was there to explain it for us, and to give away the fact that even The Sun knew it might be a bit much because they realised they needed to explain themselves.",
      "Michael Carrick gives Jonathan Woodgate a lift to training before dawn as he prepares for Man Utd baptism of fire against City.",
      "Surely there’s something crack/Carrick of dawn here. We can’t quite get there ourselves, but that’s not our job. It’s The Sun’s and they have let us down badly.",
      "",
      "The Sun are not the only ones leaning into this, though. Over at the Mail they are blown away entirely by the concept of anyone arriving for work in January ‘when it was still dark outside’.",
      "Michael Carrick is wasting no time getting down to business as Manchester United’s interim manager, with the club legend arriving to training while many are still asleep.",
      "Sunrise this morning in Manchester was at 8.17am. Arriving to work before that time is neither unusual nor noteworthy. Mediawatch is frankly jealous of the ‘many’ who are still asleep at that time.",
      "As ever, this feels like a story that fails the Mediawatch Test: would the opposite be more newsworthy? Carrick casually sauntering in for his first day with a coffee and an almond croissant at 10am would surely be more notable than arriving at the training ground, as the Mail so wonderfully put it, ‘just several hours’ after being appointed interim boss.",
      "And now we find ourselves entirely obsessed by just where exactly the cut-off exists for this. At what number of hours does the tabloid standard ‘just hours’ require the addition of a ‘several’ so as not to be too overtly taking the p*ss. And can you in fact even have ‘just several’ of anything? Is it not an oxymoron?",
      "It’s no life, this, is it?",

      "Man Utd news: Michael Carrick gets £20m transfer boost as move ‘100 per cent happening’",
      "We read the whole story to piece this together, so we trust you’re grateful.",
      "The ‘£20m transfer boost’ is itself clumsily welded together from two separate pieces of information: the first being The Guardian saying ‘transfer funds will be available’ and the second a Mirror story speculating that long-time United target Ruben Neves could be available this month for, you guessed it, 20 million of the King’s pounds.",
      "The move that is ‘100 per cent happening’ does, of course, have absolutely nothing to do with any of that. It is in fact the chances of Manuel Ugarte leaving United, according to a Turkish journalist.",
      "",
      "Adding up a list of players to get a scary final number has long been a staple of online football journalism, and the key was always not to worry at all about whether the players towards the bottom of your list of those who ‘could be SOLD’ or were ‘set to MISS’ some game or other were players who ever actually played games or contributed anything of value anyway. You could bundle in as many bomb-squadders and youth-teamers as your conscience would allow to get those numbers up, up, up.",
      "Which makes it slightly surprising that it’s only relatively recently that these outlets appear to have cottoned on to what now in hindsight seems the obvious fact that if you’re talking about players missing a match you can simply combine a scary big number from each club and come up with an even bigger and scarier number.",

      "There are bonus points straight away for turning it into a four-page photo gallery story, of course. Clicks ahoy! Further bonus points for managing to even find a picture of Dario Essugo in Chelsea action.",

      "As a result, the Premier League giants would be forced to pay a ‘significant amount of compensation’ to appoint him this summer.",
      "Germany’s performance at the World Cup will be crucial. If they underperform, German decision-makers could part ways with Nagelsmann and pursue a different manager ahead of their Euro 2028 qualifying campaign.",

      "A large portion of Arsenal supporters wanted Mikel Arteta sacked for a prolonged period, but he turned things around after being afforded time by the club’s hierarchy.",

      "However, after Sir Jim Ratcliffe and company chose Amorim as Erik ten Hag’s successor, it feels more likely that a more experienced manager with Champions League pedigree will be appointed.",
      "That is where Tuchel emerges as an obvious option. The big issue is that Ratcliffe held talks with him before handing Ten Hag a new contract in 2024. Furthermore, Tuchel is in a similar situation to Nagelsmann as he prepares to lead England at the World Cup.",

      "Man Utd legend Jaap Stam has outlined what the Red Devils should be looking for in their next permanent manager after sacking Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils ended Amorim’s time at Old Trafford last week after winning just three of his last 11 matches in charge of the club.",
      "Darren Fletcher was put in his place for two games before Michael Carrick was appointed as the Man Utd interim manager until the end of the season.",
      "The Red Devils will then decide on a permanent successor to Amorim in the summer with a number of top managers set to be available at the end of the campaign.",
      "When asked who Man Utd should be looking at as their long-term solution to their managerial woes, speaking on behalf of the Covers.com World Cup betting team, Stam said: “In modern football, tactics are very important. If you look at the Premier League, there are managers up and down the league who are technically strong. Manchester United need someone who has got the knowledge to make the team very difficult for the opposition, technically strong.",
      "“But you also need someone who is a man manager, who can get along with all the players, including the experienced squad members, not just the young ones.",
      "READ: Caretaker Carrick? Fine. But Man Utd must move for Tuchel, Enrique next to avoid Ten Hag repeat…",
      "“A good manager will know how to use the younger players and then also have the ability to talk to experienced players, giving them both the same motivation to work hard for the club and to get everything out of themselves.”",
      "On whether the time was right for Amorim to leave Man Utd, Stam added: “There were discussions about Ruben Amorim’s future and his style of play for a long time, as Manchester United were not consistently getting results. He did better this season, and was getting the team closer to the European positions – he had the opportunity to take United back into the Champions League.",
      "“But how United have been playing in recent weeks is not good enough. The moment comes when the board have to make a decision about the manager, and if the level of performance didn’t change it was inevitable that Amorim would eventually be sacked, and that’s the decision that the board have made.”",
      "Stam also warned new interim boss Carrick that it’s a big step up for the former Middlesbrough manager, he said: “Other than his brief spell as caretaker manager, Michael Carrick hasn’t held such a position at a football club of Manchester United’s size for a long period of time. He’s only had proper experience on a full-time basis at Middlesborough in the Championship, which is completely different to the Premier League.",
      "“Hopefully, Carrick brings a positive impact to the club and guides them through the rest of the season. Finishing in a European place would go a long way given the current situation at Old Trafford, so only time will tell if he proves to be a good choice.",
      "“United need an interim manager who knows the club. Saying that, the club has changed over time; it’s different from when myself, Carrick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played. But you need someone who is familiar with the fans, a good coach and someone who has strong man-management skills.",
      "“For the remainder of the season, I believe the club’s hierarchy will have told Carrick what style of football they want to see, rather than give him free rein on formation and structure.”",

      "Xabi Alonso has left Real Madrid, because they take the Spanish Super Cup played in Saudi Arabia very seriously indeed.",
      "Obviously, that wasn’t the only reason he’s gone, even if as a camel back-breaker it does seem a particularly small and twatty straw.",
      "But it instantly catapults him to the top of speculative and concrete managerial wishlists for the great, good and batsh*t of world football. By law, all reports about Alonso must from now until confirmation of his next appointment include the phrase ‘no shortage of suitors’.",
      "But where exactly will he end up? Let us rank the options from hilarious to distinctly possible, based on the early noise being generated about those aforementioned suitors.",
      "",
      "We have very much enjoyed the tone around Manchester United being interested in a man who managed to win the Bundesliga title with a team that is not Bayern Munich. It’s a reminder that for so, so many of us who had our childhoods ruined by Fergie and the lads that Man United remain an outsized deal even in a world that has left them behind.",
      "This is still, somehow, in the eyes of Gen Xers and Millennials, Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "And so all the early reports are about how United will graciously deign to consider appointing him, rather than the other way around. It is absolutely unthinkable that Alonso won’t have better offers than a job literally nobody has been able to do for what is now close on 15 years, but it’s all still framed like United are doing him a favour by sparing some of their own bandwidth to consider the idea.",
      "Also it won’t happen because we all know deep in our bones that Man United will not actually be appointing a new manager in the summer. They will give the permanent job to Michael Carrick. But we must all dance the dance until United, yet again, confuse themselves into the shadow realm at the sight of a beloved former player performing competently in an interim capacity.",
      "By the time they realise they’ve made a terrible mistake, someone else will already have snaffled Alonso. And then Jason Wilcox will appoint himself.",
      "",
      "Very much the funniest possibility, as is usually the case wherever Bumblef*ck Hotspur FC are involved. If Spurs end up with Xabi Alonso as their manager, then it will be the most spectacular opportunity yet to deploy the Little Britain ‘I fell’ meme from that time when Andy somehow ends up at the top of a tree.",
      "The genius of both Spurs and Alonso’s situation is that the idea is obviously and objectively laughable, but both their respective situations means you can just about talk yourself into imagining a dimension where it is halfway feasible. And that crumb of feasibility, that tiny minuscule link back to actual reality, is key to what makes it so funny.",
      "We can all enjoy entirely abstract absurdity, but even the tiniest grounding in reality is vital to really great comedy.",
      "And the fact is that a manager who succeeds spectacularly at a club like Bayer Leverkusen but falls on his arse at a club like Real Madrid is precisely the right profile of manager for a club like Spurs. A very big club that, try as it might, will never truly be an elite one.",
      "The Real Madrid mess might just mean Alonso has to take some medicine over his next job. It is not entirely impossible that he might have to do a little bit more overachieving before he can have another crack at regular superclub achieving.",
      "And we will laugh our c*cks clean off if it happens. Which, again, it almost certainly won’t. But almost certainly isn’t certainly.",
      "",
      "Does feel early for Alonso to skive off to international management, but would you entirely rule it out if the World Cup goes either brilliantly or terribly?",
      "Given the first two options we’ve already got past, it certainly won’t be the least appealing potential option out there for a man with 114 caps and World Cup and European winners’ medals with La Roja.",
      "No disputing the fact Spain must be a tremendously fun squad of footballers to manage, one that are matched possibly by only France in avoiding the usual problem of international management for elite club bosses where you suddenly don’t just automatically get world-class players in every position.",
      "One other thing to consider is that this is Spain and, while currently apparently settled and happy, one can never entirely rule out a great big explosive meltdown and managerial banishment just before a major tournament. So it’s not entirely out of the question for this opportunity to come up before the World Cup.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool connections that make the red half of Manchester slightly problematic are less pronounced with City, and if anything it feels more rather than less feasible for this job to be actually available in the summer.",
      "It’s definitely possible that Pep Guardiola decides he’s had quite enough of all this after what now looks like a second consecutive failure to mount a sustained challenge for a title that was for many years his confirmed personal property.",

But at the end of the day this ultimately all about 22 players chasing a leather/pig skin/synthetic orb around a field. It should never be at the point of A) fans abusing players/managers/officials and B) an entire industry made up of (often contradictory) articles decrying where everyone is going wrong.

There are many things you could say about him fairly in describing his approach to business, politics and humanity, but stupid is not one of them.",

This has been a painful process but wages are down and losses have been reduced dramatically. If you thought United were suddenly going to start making massive profits immediately then you were foolish. The trajectory is a good one though we really need someone to put their hands in their pockets and pay that debt off.",

The person to do so that I can remember (other than the fans who have been rinsed over the years). Lots of negatives too but were they unpopular decisions or were they mistakes? There’s a business case for making staff redundant and raising ticket prices as difficult as those things are to stomach. Should they have focused on staff redundancies whilst sacking managers and spending a fortune on players?",
      "Sacking managers costs money but the cost in and of itself doesn’t affect the profitably of the organisation as much as underlying staff costs. And when the managers have you playing terrible football what does that do for profitability?",

I could have told you he wasn’t worth pursuing in the first place but at least United can be said to have failed fast here. I would question why he was replaced by Wilcox and not a world class proven Sporting Director. That said, I’m not sure what Wilcox has done wrong so far – aside from not signing a midfielder in the summer, though United were short of goals and that seems to have been addressed.",
      "I think recruitment has been generally good – younger players (Dorgu, Sesko, Lammens) or those approaching their peak and proven in Our League (Mbeumo, Cunha). Players moved on when they’ve needed to be (no one wants Malacia it seems). Going for Lammens over Martinez was a brave call but a smart one in the long term and with United’s constraints I think. This all seems to be a significant improvement behind the scenes on what came before.",
      "Question marks on some of the haggling over Mbeumo – should we have pivoted to Semenyo? – whether Sesko will come good and why we didn’t sign a midfielder, but no club comes out of a transfer window without question marks (see Liverpool) and a squad as badly constructed as United’s will take years to rebuild.",
      "I think Wilcox has been wrongly blamed for hiring Amorim in the first place and for some reason the Sporting Director can’t suggest changes to the head coach even though literally everyone questioned why Amorim when back to 3 at the back for the Wolves game after beating Newcastle with 4 at the back. But then what do I know? I’ve never been a Sporting Director. And neither has anyone at F365. When Monchi or Begiristain comes out with their own F365 Says pieces about every mistake Wilcox has made I’ll sit up and take notice. Until that point he probably doesn’t deserve to be known as a “dunderheed”.",
      "And on a final point, I’ve been really disappointed that Shea Lacey’s sending off has been used all over the place to somehow encapsulate United’s entire plight. Even Nicholson referenced it, though indirectly. This guy’s is EIGHTEEN. He doesn’t deserve any abuse from anyone for anything that he does on the football pitch. Was he a bit silly? Yes. But do you know what? He bounced a ball into the ground metres from anyone in the 91st minute of an FA Cup tie. This wasn’t a seasoned professional, it was an over exuberant young man who’d spent the last twenty minutes showing his peers exactly how football should be done. Ref could’ve been a bit less exuberant himself.",
      "Maybe we should think about whether it wasn’t Shea Lacey that was a bit silly but the rules themselves or even the game itself. I suggest we all have a think about whether it is in fact us that are all rather silly for putting so much weight on the actions of 22 much younger men chasing a ball around a pitch and those that profit from it.",
      "My point? In a world of Trump, climate catastrophe and pending AI apocalypse, isn’t this all a bit silly? Isn’t our anger best directed somewhere other than at people that kick a ball around or arrange said kickabouts?

      "After spending a week searching for a suitable club legend to replace Ruben Amorim until the summer, INEOS have landed on Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Carrick is probably the more sensible, albeit boring, option out of the two, with three factors said to be in his favour over the manager he previously assisted at Man Utd.",
      "And now that the Red Devils have a new interim boss until the summer, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his recruitment team cannot afford not to get the permanent appointment right if they want any hope of ‘Mission 21’ coming to fruition.",
      "So, as tempting as it may be to appoint Carrick permanently if he guides Man Utd to Champions League qualification, INEOS must not fall into this trap again after the previous mistakes made with Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Instead, a high-level manager is required to sort out the mess at Old Trafford, and several credible candidates are already in the frame.",
      "READ: Premier League manager rankings: where do Amorim and Maresca land in list of all 28(!) managers?",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner did himself no favours in the FA Cup at the weekend, but this is a rare blot on his résumé, and he had been earmarked as an early frontrunner to be Man Utd’s next permanent boss.",
      "However, the latest reports have indicated that PSG boss Luis Enrique has risen to the top of the list as Man Utd’s ‘main target’ among four options, with Thomas Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino also mentioned.",
      "Enrique is one of the very few elite managers currently in football, and it would be wonderful for the Premier League to have him in England, especially with it likely that Pep Guardiola’s time at Manchester City is close to an end.",
      "There have been murmurs about Enrique leaving Champions League holders Paris-Saint Germain in the summer, but this does not necessarily mean he will end up at Man Utd, with Liverpool and Man City far more likely if their managers’ jobs were to become available in the near future.",
      "But if logic was thrown out of the window and Enrique does join Man Utd, how would their team look next season?",
      "Well, it would look very different based on formation alone, as Enrique is renowned for his fluid 4-3-3 formation and this could be used to good effect by Man Utd, provided there are some notable purchases in the summer.",
      "Starting with the goalkeeper, summer signing Senne Lammens picks himself after slotting in seamlessly following his move from Royal Antwerp. This department was a major problem position last season, so it says a lot about how well the 23-year-old has performed that it is now a non-topic.",
      "Man Utd, unlike in midfield and up front, are also pretty strong in defence as they have an array of options, with Diogo Dalot and Patrick Dorgu currently standout candidates to start at right-back and left-back should they revert to a back four.",
      "Dalot looks far more at home at full-back than wing-back as he was one of Man Utd’s most consistent performers before Amorim changed the system, while Dorgu, despite still being quite raw, has shown signs of promise and could be excellent if he can hone his craft under a brilliant coach.",
      "At centre-back, Enrique would likely favour Leny Yoro alongside Matthijs de Ligt as they provide a nice blend of being dependable defenders that can also cope with having the ball at their feet.",
      "The most significant changes would come in midfield, which is inevitable regardless of whether Enrique takes charge or not.",
      "It is being widely reported that the Red Devils will prioritise landing two new midfielders in the summer, with these signings likely to fill the void left by Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro.",
      "Amorim is said to be the reason why Fernandes stuck around in the summer, and without the head coach around, INEOS can take one of their last chances to cash in on their club captain for a sizable fee to raise funds for a rebuild. Casemiro, meanwhile, needs to be eased out of the picture for a long-term replacement, even if he accepts a large pay cut to stick around for another year.",
      "In this case, the dream scenario for Man Utd would be the signings of Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton to replace Fernandes and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba to replace Casemiro.",
      "READ: Caretaker Carrick? Fine. But Man Utd must move for Tuchel, Enrique next to avoid Ten Hag repeat…",
      "Wharton, who could reportedly be bought for a reasonable fee of £65m by a Champions League club in the summer, and Baleba, who is still likely to cost around £100m following United’s failed move last year, could operate alongside Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "England international Mainoo is the big winner of Amorim’s sacking, and this is going to be a big year for the centre-midfielder, with the appointment of Enrique (or an alternative of a similar calibre) enough to help Man Utd with their campaign to land Wharton and Baleba.",
      "In attack, Benjamin Sesko is Man Utd’s current striker project, so he would remain as their No.9 under Enrique and potentially be supported on either flank by Bryan Mbeumo and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Matheus Cunha is an option to cover multiple positions, but Mbeumo and Rashford are more natural fits for the wide roles in Enrique’s formation.",
      "Mbeumo is already a vital player for Man Utd, and while Rashford has proved his worth at Barcelona, their lingering financial problems hinder a deal, and he’ll definitely be more open to a return to Old Trafford without Amorim and with Enrique takes charge.",
      "Man Utd have identified Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique as one of four leading candidates to succeed Ruben Amorim permanently, according to reports.",
      "After Antoine Semenyo, Manchester City’s latest ‘hijack’ on Manchester United leaves INEOS with the lesser of two £100m signings…",
      "According to reports, Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique has emerged as the ‘favourite’ to be Ruben Amorim’s permanent replacement at Manchester United.",
      "Oliver Glasner is the ‘top candidate’ to be Manchester United’s next permanent head coach, with this the XI we think he would select if he’s appointed…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could still offload Manuel Ugarte this month, while they have been ‘set a price’ for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",

      "With an epic season of Managergeddon in full swing, it feels like as good a time as any to dust off the ol’ Premier League Manager Rankings for a quick redo.",
      "There are a great many more managers to include, for one thing, because the last time we did this it was all the way back in October. If you want to know just how far back in the ancient mists of time October was, Andoni Iraola was top of this list, and Thomas Frank was in the top eight with Scott Parker just behind him as he steered Burnley to a position outside the relegation zone.",
      "An awful lot has changed, basically. And if we wait any longer to do this then we’d have to include at least two more managers; Michael Carrick once his return to Man United is rubberstamped, and whoever replaces whichever one of Thomas Frank or Nuno Espirito Santo fails to survive this weekend’s El Sackico between Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "So crack on we must. October’s rankings are in brackets below, with the full majesty of the many thousand words of wrongness here to be enjoyed in full if that’s your bag.",
      "Mate. Just…mate. Possibly the worst managerial reign in the entire history of the Premier League, and that is some shout. It’s certainly the shortest.",
      "Look, we sort of get it, we do. We get why he took the job. He probably did need to move fast to get back in the Premier League, try and convince someone to take a punt on him while those memories of Europa League glory were fresh enough in everyone’s minds to stop them thinking too long or too hard about the sheer ridiculousness of taking Spurs to 17th in the league. He wasn’t to know then that Thomas Frank was treating 17th as his target this season.",
      "It’s asking a huge amount to say Postecoglou should have turned down a job that got him straight back into the European competition where he’d just had such spectacular success.",
      "But…he should have turned down that job. Obviously he should. It went wrong in all the ways everyone knew it would go wrong, except at about five times the pace. There were, even among those truly cataclysmically awful results, flashes of what makes Angeball so beguiling. There were some lovely moves and stunning goals.",
      "Yet for every one of those there were two or three defensive calamities, and injuries, for a team that just didn’t have those things last season.",
      "It was always just so obviously asking too much of both Postecoglou and Forest’s players to make such a seismic shift in approach work without any kind of pre-season to bring in the right players and get everyone to understand the process.",
      "Postecoglou will walk away with a nice pay-off for barely a month’s work, but with his reputation in tatters. It is only eight months since he did the unthinkable and delivered a major trophy to Tottenham, yet now, two sackings later, his managerial career at this level of club football is surely over.",
      "There must have been better options with just a bit more patience. But still we’re kind of glad he did it, because Nuno to Ange to Dyche in barely five weeks is something the like of which will never be seen again.",
      "",
      "Got absolutely none of the help he needed from the club in the summer, which meant all the talk during the late-season struggles last term about not judging Potter until he had his own players and a full pre-season to instil his methods became instantly moot.",
      "But while Potter was not and is not the primary source of West Ham’s travails, let’s also not pretend he is blameless. West Ham didn’t help him, but he didn’t help himself either, and a once-promising career suffered another huge step back.",
      "We’ll admit we didn’t really know how or where the road to recovery might begin for Potter, but will cheerfully admit we didn’t have ‘Simply be almost immediately named manager of Sweden’ high on our list.",
      "That admittedly incredible run of promotions with Ostersund is still evidently highly regarded in a country that has had an absolute catastrof*ck of a World Cup qualifying campaign but one that still has enormous potential for absurd redemption with their Nations League success meaning they need only find a way past Ukraine then Poland or Albania to bag a place in North America despite finishing literally bottom of their qualifying group without a win to their name.",
      "",
      "Now looks utterly doomed to a two-sacking season which, considering what he got up to last season, is just ridiculous really. He was our manager of the year in 2024!",
      "What there is, still, is mitigation. His greatest achievement at Forest might have been in how long he was actually there before the falling out occurred, and West Ham might just be the most impossible job in all of English football.",
      "But he is also one of about 10 managers on this list for whom the old classic ‘not the problem, but also not the solution’ clearly applies.",
      "We’ve never really been able to get past the way, specifically, he approached the game at home against Liverpool. The Hammers were actually something approaching upwardly mobile at that point, with wins by 3-1 and 3-2 scorelines in their two previous home games and a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth. Liverpool were in that bit where they kept losing by three goals for some reason.",
      "Yet Nuno decided this was the time to go full and absolute Nuno instead of sensing the weakness and opportunity. Gunning for a 0-0 draw, he instead got a routine 2-0 defeat.",
      "It might seem silly to pin so much of a relegation-haunted season on a game against Liverpool and maybe it is, but it really does seem like a point at which, well, dreams faded and died.",
      "They’ve managed just three draws and no wins in eight Premier League games since. They’ve lost relegation six-pointers in their last two league games; Nuno surely cannot survive making that three in a row in El Sackico at Spurs this weekend, a misery spectacle of such epic beleaguerment that it is literally impossible to conceive a situation in which both managers survive.",
      "",
      "To be honest, we had The Fear when Wolves followed up that six-game winning run in March and April with four winless games to round out the season. Knowing Wolves’ fondness for letting the end to one season bleed into the next.",
      "We didn’t think it would look quite like this, though, even after they followed that little end-of-season slump with the classic ‘let’s sell lots of good players and not really bother replacing them’ tactic.",
      "Pereira went from hero to zero alarmingly quickly, and it was clear he had no idea how to pull Wolves out of the tailspin in which they found themselves.",
      "A real pity given how well he had them playing at one point last season, but hindsight has not been kind to that six-game winning run, either.",
      "It was, rather brilliantly, the second-longest winning run any Premier League team managed in 2025 (and it was only recently that Aston Villa – not Liverpool or Arsenal or Man City – bettered it) but it was also against three of the very worst relegated sides we’d ever seen as well as West Ham, Man United and Spurs who were all enduring nightmares of their own from which none has yet truly awoken.",
      "So… yeah. Good fun, sure, but also perhaps the single most misleading six-game run in football history.",
      "",
      "Fell out with everyone, which given who that ‘everyone’ is at Nottingham Forest is kind of understandable. But f*ck, what a waste. Didn’t get the chance to follow through on the brilliant work he did last season and was the first manager out of a job in the Premier League this season.",
      "Despite that, his volatile, anger-filled few weeks at Forest are still probably his best weeks of the season. Because his punishment for the end of his Forest reign has been severe indeed. Surely not even Mr Marinakis would have wished the West Ham job on his new worst enemy.",
      "",
      "It’s all about optics, isn’t it? The photos of Thomas Frank wandering gormlessly around Bournemouth looking gormless with a little Arsenal-branded coffee cup in his hand already have a Steve McClaren wally-with-the-brolly quality to them. When – and it is surely now when not if – the axe finally falls on this doomed experiment, those are the pictures that will accompany this story’s telling.",
      "There is a profound Spurs quality to the absurdity of it all, of course. The series of events that leads to it even being possible just feels like something that only happens and could only happen to them.",
      "But also… consider the reverse. Imagine Mikel Arteta was ‘caught’ supping from a Spurs cup. It would all feel very different, wouldn’t it? The memes would all be about ‘drinking Spurs tears’ and such. Even a few short months ago, this daft little incident happening exactly as it now has would have produced many banters about the impressiveness of finding a cup with Arsenal’s name on it. How we’d have laughed.",
      "Point is, it doesn’t really mean anything. It’s all a projection. But a powerful one nevertheless, one that comes to symbolise everything for a manager who arrived as a details man and now can’t even spot a big ol’ Arsenal badge on a little coffee cup.",
      "What actually does matter, we fear, is that Frank has started talking complete b*llocks. Again, pretty understandable that anyone tasked with managing Spurs eventually finds themselves doing so, but it’s not a sign of anything good.",

      "“In a storm, some are building fences and hiding behind it, others are building windmills and getting stronger and getting more energy and learning from it.”",

      "But here’s the thing that’s even worse than talking like a Jake Humphrey podcast guest – if you can even imagine such a concept. It doesn’t even actually work on its own batsh*t terms.",
      "First of all, if you’re building anything in a storm then you’ve already f*cked it by failing to adequately prepare yourself. Build the windmill before the storm arrives, if anything.",
      "But also… Frank is no windmill-builder. He has spent recent weeks complaining about the fans, repeatedly pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if that was normal or acceptable rather than the specific thing he has been tasked with changing not aiming to repeat, and noting that January is a very difficult month.",
      "The storm has arrived and he’s been busy building crappy little fences and drinking his crappy little Arsenal coffees.",
      "What felt like inevitable defeat to an Aston Villa side that has streaked past Spurs in recent seasons means that the drudgery of the league campaign is all that’s realistically left for a forlorn club.",
      "Barring, of course, a Champions League knockout run of such vanishing unlikelihood as to make the 2019 effort look prosaic.",
      "Vanishing unlikelihoods discarded, and you’re left with a manager brought in to prove that Spurs could compete on multiple fronts now competing on none, and if the upcoming six-pointers at West Ham and Burnley go awry that will swiftly be literally and not just figuratively true",
      "There is no avoiding the thought that Thomas Frank’s fictitious windmill is about to get all spattered with some more very real sh*t.",

      "A shiny yet fictional pound on its way to the first reader who can remember the game Wolves’ Under-21 boss was in caretaker charge for. No, you don’t get a pound of any kind for saying it was a defeat.",
      "Chelsea, it was. Lost 3-0. But it did take them until the second half to score, so it was very much not the worst Wolves effort of late 2025.",
      "",
      "Not his fault, of course, but it is just enormously post-2013 Man United that their response to another largely self-inflicted crisis has been to think short and soft before concluding that the answer must again be ‘one of Fergie’s boys’. Except, of course, they’re going one better this time. Now the answer is in fact ‘two of Fergie’s boys’ with Fletcher currently interim for the interim, which at present speed and course appears set to be Michael Carrick rather than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "Still time, of course, for them both to get a go as United cheerily write off another season. Even if that season is now sure to be the shortest possible 40-game effort that a Premier League team can ‘enjoy’.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was an astonishing and brilliant one-off. A genuine contender in any conversation around the greatest manager of all time. But he is now an albatross around this club’s neck. They can never hope to replicate even a fraction of his success while they remain in such deferential thrall to his era. Nobody is saying it’s easy to move on from what was two decades of quite ludicrous success. But they really must.",

      "Yet in the end it was really quite simple and contains a valuable lesson for any other managers who find themselves entirely regretting the life choices they have made that have led them to their current predicament.",
      "Just take on the faceless suits. It really is that easy to get away from any club.",
      "Amorim tried more traditional approaches to getting the tin-tack. Absolute mule-brained stubborn and rigid insistence on his own methods even when they failed again and again. Losing just so very many football matches. Finishing 15th in the Premier League. Losing to Grimsby while p*ssing about with his little magnets. Losing a real-life final to Tottenham, for goodness’ sake.",
      "None of it worked. But mildly suggesting that a random Blackburn winger from the 1990s might not be infallible? Game over.",
      "Amorim’s entire Man United career feels like a modern football parable, and its final act one that should strike a chord with us all. While it may always be the head coach/manager – and Amorim was pretty keen to draw a distinction there as well – who must act as the public face and human shield of any football club it is the silent suits (whether those suits be business or track) who wield the power and yet are nowhere to be seen when trouble is really brewing.",

One is in the middle of relegating a team that has been a Premier League club in all but four of its season, and the other is desperately trying to do the same with an ever-present Premier League club while chatting awful and appalling sh*t about fences and windmills while sipping coffee from a cup featuring the badge of their bitterest and most successful rivals.",
      "Up next is the current manager of the team 19th in the league. And then you’ve got the manager of the team in fourth.",
      "Arne Slot and Liverpool are having a deeply peculiar season. Liverpool aren’t having a particularly good one, but we’d argue Slot personally is having a far worse campaign.",
      "As far as Liverpool as a collective go, our current working theory is that fourth is about right. That they have, over the course of the season, played the fourth-best (or, if one were so inclined, 17th least bad) football of any Premier League club this season.",
      "There are two things to note about that. One, it’s still not really good enough. Not when so much has been spent on theoretically improving a team and squad that last season were very much number one.",
      "And two, that broadly and despite the obvious results-driven narratives with which we all inevitably operate, their level hasn’t really fluctuated that much. They’ve been okay but not great pretty much all season.",
      "It’s just that at the start of the season that okay-but-not-great manifested itself in a string of absurd and unlikely late wins, and then after that for ages and ages a run of equally absurd – and also again often quite late – defeats.",
      "Their results remains absurdly streaky. They won their first five league games, then lost six of the next seven, then won four of the next six and have now drawn three in a row. We really don’t think there’s a particularly convincing case to be made that the actual standard of their play was conspicuously better or worse at any time in that run.",
      "Apart, possibly, from the 2-1 home defeat to Manchester United in which the sheer scale of their headloss and panic was genuinely alarming. That was a game in which they spent the entire second half in 94th-minute goal-chasing mode.",
      "And that’s where Slot comes in. He really hasn’t handled the slings and arrows of Our League’s outrageous fortune particularly well this season. And that’s in marked contrast to the cool, level-headed way in which he spent last season merely polishing some of the rough edges off Jurgen Klopp’s heavy-metalers with such devastingly profound effect.",
      "This season just seems to have rattled him entirely. As ever with any discussion of Liverpool this season, it feels unfair not to at least acknowledge the unique and harrowing circumstances in which they found themselves following the death of Diogo Jota. There is ample mitigation for heads not being right anywhere in the club.",
      "But at some point the manager needs to be in charge. To take charge. It was the most impressive thing about Slot’s first season at Anfield. The seemingly gargantuan, arguably impossible, job of carrying enough authority with what was, famously almost exclusively, Jurgen Klopp’s old squad was handled with such casual aplomb.",
      "Yet now, with a Liverpool squad far more his own, he seems to have less authority and control than ever. This feels like a season that is simply happening to Liverpool, and happening to Slot.",
      "Slot’s failure to treat the twin imposters of triumph and disaster just the same in those early months of the season really do feel more and more like tone-setters for the uncertainty of what was to come.",
      "Let’s be honest, we all got carried away with both the start Liverpool’s reigning champions made and the collapse that followed. But we’re not all Liverpool’s actual manager. He’s not supposed to get as lost in the noise as the rest of us. He’s not supposed to basically accuse Man United of cheating because they deployed the darkest art in the game: squad rotation.",
      "He’s supposed to be above that. And now we must face the baffling but entirely real possibility that he could become the third Big Six manager this season to be outlasted by windmilling Thomas Frank.",
      "",
      "Another Big Six manager who paid the price (or got his escape, depending on your perspective) for off-field disagreements rather than on-field performance.",
      "We haven’t ever, in truth, been entirely convinced by Maresca as an elite coach. But he also probably did do just about everything and more that could reasonably be asked of anyone working under the unique weirdness that is BlueCo’s Chelsea, where you are less a football coach and more a layer of middle-management bureaucracy in a vast and inscrutable player-trading empire.",
      "We were even more frustrated this season than we were last with the way he self-fulfillingly talked Chelsea out of the title race, but we also understand what he was driving at. It must be immensely frustrating to try and work as Chelsea’s head coach, a job where the thing that is in many ways the biggest hindrance to performing to the best of your ability is also the very thing that means you won’t get the full credit if and when it does go well.",
      "“Oh, anyone could succeed when they get half-a-billion quid to spend!” is a pretty compelling argument. But only if you as the coach get that half-a-billion quid to spend on the specific talents and player profile you need or want to try and drive on-field success. Not so much when that money is instead being buried on players that a spreadsheet suggests have the greatest potential for future profit.",
      "It’s not even that BlueCo are wrong, in their own grim way. Chelsea’s sales sheet tells you this is a wild and unscrupulous but undeniably feasible way to run a business. It’s just surely not a great way to build a football team.",
      "And we very strongly suspect Maresca’s work in keeping the whole show on the road over the last 18 months is about to look far, far better in hindsight then it ever really did at the time.",
      "",
      "Inherited a shambles, obviously, but the good news with that is the only way is up. Or at least no further down.",
      "The first seven games, which all ended in defeat, did provide some challenge to that notion. But did also offer occasional hints at progress. The 2-1 defeats at both Arsenal and Liverpool were not those of a club with two points from half a season.",
      "And now look at them. Five points from three games and a nice big FA Cup win against lower-league opposition might not seem much, but it is a veritable feast compared to the famine that preceded it.",
      "They probably will still go down, like, but they do now at least appear set to a) beat Derby’s infamous all-time low and b) potentially chuck some spanners in some works for others elsewhere along the way.",
      "It’s not much. It’s a lot more than looked possible a month ago.",
      "",
      "Slightly odd team, are Everton. Often feels like they’re right on the brink of breaking out into being really quite good and really quite fun, but then they… don’t. And, we slightly hate ourselves for this conclusion, but can’t help it: Moyes, that.",
      "He’s not doing a bad job, obviously, because Everton are not in mortal relegation peril and that has been the general pre-Moyes vibe in recent seasons. There is further mitigation in the initial growing pains that come with any move to a new stadium and the loss of familiarity and atmosphere that is all but unavoidable.",
      "Above all else for anyone thinking of aiming any serious criticism Moyes’ way at all is the extreme cautionary tale that West Ham have become since his departure.",
      "We still maintain that Hammers fans’ desire for more than the perfunctory survival football he was offering by the end was perfectly understandable, but bloody hell.",
      "So yes, maybe Everton do for now still have to be careful what they wish for. But at the same time it is now just one win in seven games for the Toffees, including some markedly insipid efforts against Burnley and Brentford and Wolves and a third-round FA Cup exit that confirms the extension of what is now one of the league’s most eye-catching and embarrassing barren runs will continue into a 32nd year.",
      "",
      "It was October 22 when we declared Iraola the best manager of the first two months of the Premier League season. Four days later they eased to victory over Nottingham Forest – their fifth win in eight games after an opening-day defeat at Liverpool – to move second in the table.",
      "Then simply didn’t bother winning any of their next 11 games in the league before a desperately needed visit from Dr Tottenham. Tottenham, for what it’s worth, were just a point below Bournemouth in third at the end of October.",
      "We do hold our hands up when we get things wrong here. Usually because we have no choice and are bang to rights. But this time we don’t think this is an egregious f*ck-up on our part.",
      "Given the players they’d lost in the summer, what Iraola appeared to be doing two months into the season really was extraordinary and we stand by our assessment.",
      "Such was the strife of the summer that even after that 11-game winless run nobody could really say Bournemouth were in a place wildly different to pre-season expectations. Even now he still gets a passing grade for having them just about clear of the stickiest relegation soup.",
      "But for Iraola himself, if he harbours – as we assume he does – loftier ambitions somewhere down the line then he really does need to sort out this idiosyncratic penchant for absurd alternating streaks of brilliant and terrible results.",
      "There are obvious examples within this very league this season of just how much harder it is to conceal those flaws once you’re at one of the clubs where the spotlight is more harsh.",
      "",
      "Look, overall he’s still doing extraordinary things isn’t he? Nobody’s disputing that about a man who delivered Crystal Palace’s first ever silverware and some absurd above-weight-punching all round.",
      "But… coming to an end, isn’t it? Definite ‘far as I can take them’ vibes coming off the place now, and there’s a bit of a funk developing. Let’s not any of us pretend that becoming the first top-flight side to ever lose an FA Cup game to a sixth-tier one was something we expected; but the idea of Palace getting into some kind of strife at Macclesfield on their first return to the competition since lifting the trophy was very easy to picture.",
      "In all, across four competitions, it’s now nine games without a win over the last month or so. They’ve gone out of both domestic cups in that time, and have made hard work of the Conference League where they must now come through a play-off against European heavyweights Sigma Olomouc or Zrinjski Mostar just to reach the last 16.",
      "Most damningly of all, that winless run even includes defeat at the hands of the good doctor after a really quite pitiful non-performance in a 1-0 home defeat to Spurs.",
      "It’s a real shame because it’s been quite a ride, but it just all feels like it’s over. That’s reality for clubs like Palace, who always knew they wouldn’t have Glasner forever. But it still seems to us like it didn’t absolutely have to peter out quite so meekly as this.",
      "",
      "The FA Cup win at Man United feels like a significant one for Hurzeler and co, bringing interest back to a season that had grown in real danger of aimless drift after a run of one win in eight Premier League games dragged them right back to the very middle of the great mid-table morass.",
      "Absolutely nothing wrong with steering Brighton to comfy mid-table, of course, and the sheer size of that mid-table this season has led to Hurzeler having a slight under-the-radar feel. There is not for him the same links to ‘bigger’ jobs that we saw in Roberto De Zerbi’s time or that you get now with your Glasners and your Silvas and the Iraolas of this world.",
      "Which is odd, really, because Brighton do have a pretty eye-catching way of going about their incessant mid-tabling, always seemingly equally happy to be pulling down the pants of the biggest boys – four points this season off Man City, for instance – as they are donating cheap points to helpless lost causes like West Ham or Wolves or Spurs.",
      "",
      "When you’ve set the standards Guardiola has set, it doesn’t take much to look like failure. And two seasons without a meaningful title challenge, which now seems likely after a damaging run of quite silly draws, would constitute that.",
      "The most alarming element of it all is that City have come unstuck at what looked like the precise moment they would in fact strike. They’d reeled Arsenal in, cutting the lead to just two points somehow, and looked poised to make life extremely uncomfortable for a team that had seen it all before.",
      "Instead, they’ve failed to beat Sunderland, Chelsea and Brighton – the latter two setbacks worsened by coming at home in games where they led. Just not very City and not very Guardiola to be letting anyone – either in those matches specifically or their wider league context – off the hook like that.",
      "We keep swinging one way then the other with Guardiola this season. Sometimes we think he’s reinvigorated by the challenge of building a new team and at others we think he won’t last the season without doing a Klopp.",
      "Our internal Guardiola swingometer is once again headed in that direction.",
      "",
      "We really did worry that either he or Fulham were going to do something very silly they would both regret when the ever-tempting sack window of the November international break arrived with Fulham in something approaching doldrum status after a fairly miserable defeat at Silva’s former club Everton.",
      "Happily, six wins and two draws from their subsequent 10 Premier League games have put all that silly talk to bed and lifted Fulham right back to their correct and proper place in the middle of the pack, vying once again with Brighton for the crown of the Premier League’s most mid-table club in what is looking like the Premier League’s most mid-table season.",
      "Obviously the risk now is that he has, if anything, gone too far the other way. He’s almost, for me, Clive, now managing Fulham too well. Because with that comes the danger that he finds himself doing something really stupid like taking the Tottenham job.",
      "Everyone must resist. Fulham and Silva is just one of those rare and precious club-manager combos where no good can come for anyone if it is set asunder.",
      "",
      "A man with a famously excellent record of marching teams into the Premier League in glorious fashion and then meekly steering them immediately back whence they came has, at last, hit upon a formula for bucking that trend.",
      "It’s a fine effort and well worth remembering now just how unlikely it all looked as recently as November. Leeds had lost three in a row and were 2-0 down at Man City at half-time, and it looked like another textbook Farke promotion-and-despair one-two punch.",
      "But while the unlikely second-half fightback in that game cruelly didn’t deliver actual points it did instil belief and confidence.",
      "Leeds have been an entirely different prospect since that day. They’ve beaten Chelsea, drawn twice with Liverpool and hammered Crystal Palace in a seven-game unbeaten run that only ended with an instant classic of a game at Newcastle that could have finished with just about any scoreline but was, unluckily for Farke and Leeds, 4-3 to the home side when the music stopped.",
      "Absolutely no reason that performance should derail what Leeds have going on right now, and they were impressive again in sidestepping a potential FA Cup banana skin at Derby on a weekend when others were far more careless.",
      "",
      "That he and Newcastle now find themselves sixth in the league after what has, for the most part, been a difficult and challenging campaign says perhaps more about this season’s Premier League than it does specifically about Newcastle.",
      "The entire mid-table area, in which nine points separates 12 teams from fourth-placed Liverpool to Bournemouth in 15th, is built to deceive and hoodwink. Find yourself 13th one weekend and it can feel like the sky is falling in.",
      "But win a few games against Burnley, Palace and Leeds and suddenly all is right again. The humdrum reality, of course, is that unless there’s something truly compellingly obvious for good or bad, then caution must be advised about getting over-excited in either direction.",
      "We can all see with our eyes that Brentford are performing wonderfully well, for instance, or that Spurs are f*cking rancid. With Newcastle, though, they weren’t really terrible when they were 14th and they aren’t suddenly great now they’re sixth.",
      "But maybe that’s the point. This is not a season when greatness is a necessity for great things to happen. And for both Howe and Newcastle, for all the difficulties they’ve faced in the transfer market and with injuries and noise, great things remain entirely possible in multiple ways.",
      "They’re back in the Champions League hunt via the league, and they’re going to be in at least the play-offs of this season’s competition, all while remaining active players in both domestic cups.",
      "It’s not been a straightforward season for club or manager, but it absolutely could still be a generational one. Or they might crash out of everything and wind up 11th. That’s part of what makes it all so exciting. There aren’t many others who are crossing the midway point of the season with quite such a wide range of potential outcomes as Howe and his team.",
      "",
      "In the summer, Brentford lost their inspirational manager, the fourth and sixth leading goalscorers in the 24/25 league season (with a mere 39 goals between them), their captain, and their goalkeeper.",
      "They replaced these individuals with their set-piece coach, Dango Ouattara from Bournemouth, some spare parts from here and there, and a Reiss Nelson.",
      "They are fifth in the Premier League. Now even allowing for the congested bunching-up of all the teams who aren’t either challenging for the title or desperately fighting relegation, that’s ridiculous.",
      "We don’t trust Keith Andrews, but we do fear and respect him because we can only conclude some ungodly and dark magic is involved here.",
      "",
      "Sunderland are actually now without a Premier League win in five games. Nobody has noticed this because a) they’re still doing tremendously well, obviously, and more importantly b) they still drew four of them.",
      "The amusing reality is that during this sticky spell since the derby-day win over Newcastle they have still extended their lead over each and every member of the current bottom four.",
      "In summary, then: even when things have been as bad as they been all season for Sunderland, when they have been shorn of their AFCON stars and bedevilled by injuries, Regis Le Bris and the gang are still comfortably exceeding, even in that specific run, any and all pre-season expectations.",
      "If you find yourselves, as a promoted club, in a situation where you can have a bad run and slip all the way down to 10th in the table, then things really are going tremendously well.",
      "",
      "The starkest of all reminders that October was f*cking ages ago. Back then, Emery and Villa were still making their first tentative steps in turning round a miserable start to the season, one that felt full of hangovers and regrets and disappointment at the way 2024/25 had finished on the final day at Old Trafford.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League by cruel and fine margins had felt like a significant sliding doors moment for Emery and Villa, and a difficult summer and even worse start to the new campaign left the unmistakable sense of something wonderful coming to its end without ever really hitting the heights it might have done.",
      "Then Villa – and we really don’t understand why more managers and teams don’t adopt such a policy – simply set about winning all of the football matches.",
      "After no wins and just a single goal in their first five league matches of the season, Villa won 12 of the next 13. Even after a recent ‘slump’ that comprises a defeat at champions-elect Arsenal and goalless draw at Crystal Palace, they remain level on points with City and miles clear of any undignified squabbly scramble for a Champions League finish.",
      "Add in routine FA Cup progress at Spurs, who they have for now overtaken entirely, and serene progress through the very winnable Europa League and this now longer feels anything like something coming to a premature end.",

      "Still as odd as socks, but he has built a champion Arsenal team that, for the first time since The Invincibles, combines both the talent to win the league with the minerals.",
      "There was a good deal of guff after the defeat at Villa, with a large amount read into the body language of the players after conceding the late winner.",
      "Now a lot of that is because it is always and undeniably funny to watch grown adult men have full limb-thrashing toddler tantrums more akin to a three-year-old denied sweets in Tesco. But a lot of it was along more faux-concerned ‘hope not, hope not’ lines about what it indicated about their mental state and preparedness for the battle ahead.",
      "Now it’s true that Arsenal weren’t good in their next match either, and were pretty lucky it was against Wolves. But they did still manage to win it. And then the next four after that. And then draw with Liverpool to preserve what had by then grown into a six-point lead at the top of the table.",
      "We’re not saying Arteta suddenly has a gang of mentality monsters on his hands. But they’re not about to do anything that even the internet can dress up as a bottling, and just as importantly nobody now looks remotely equipped to place them under the kind of pressure that might test that new-found steel in any meaningful way.",
      "They will win the league, they will thoroughly deserve to win the league, and the fact they’ll have done it after signing a ‘missing piece of the puzzle’ striker who is absolutely sh*tbone awful is only more impressive, in a way.",

      "When a half-season hit of ‘DNA’ or a heady dose of nostalgia fails to arouse Manchester United fans, that’s when you know you’ve really f***ed up.",
      "The appointment of Michael Carrick as interim manager at Old Trafford has been greeted with the same indifference that provided the backdrop to the week-long race to the hot seat. Carrick emerged the winner, beating Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in what was largely a toss-up with a double-sided coin.",
      "However United came to the decision, it is perhaps the best of the two outcomes. It could be viewed as a triumph for tactics over vibes. Which might be a step forward; it really is hard to tell at Manchester United.",
      "And that wait in itself could become a problem for Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and whoever else calls the shots at Old Trafford these days. While they are doubtless backslapping each other right now – well done, boys, good process – the fear lingers that the board have set themselves up for another fall.",
      "Because there is a chance that Carrick succeeds. What then?",
      "United’s stated aim at the start of this season was a return to the Champions League and, perhaps more because of the ineptitude of others than anything they themselves are doing right, that remains a realistic goal.",
      "It is likely England will have five teams in the Champions League next season. Carrick and his coaching staff walked into Carrington to take over a side one point off fifth in the Premier League with – woefully, but handily – absolutely no distractions whatsoever.",
      "If Carrick drags United back to the top table of European football for 2026/27 while stirring Stretford End sentiment, it would not be an unreasonable expectation of the interim boss to have his title changed to something a little more permanent.",
      "And so, most likely, United’s doom cycle continues.",
      "MORE Who will be Manchester United manager next season? Xabi enters the building…",
      "It has been reported that one of Carrick’s more appealing qualities to United was his grasp of the temporary nature of his appointment, in contrast to Solskjaer, who hoped to make it impossible for the board to wave him off again in May.",
      "It is damning that restrained ambition may be seen by United as a positive trait, but also understandable. Because INEOS have been here before.",
      "In 2024, it seems they were set on replacing Erik ten Hag, which was the right call. Then, inconveniently, he went and bloody won the FA Cup. New contracts all round.",
      "That, to the surprise of almost no one, proved to be the wrong call, though it is was certainly the easiest at the time even in the absence of clamour from fans. Have United learned their lesson?",
      "We could find out in May. The fear must be that this United board will simply kick the can down Sir Matt Busby Way before gathering the day after the end of the season to thrash out the way forward. Europe beckons? Carry on, Carrick.",
      "But if United want to be taken seriously again, then Ratcliffe, Wilcox and Berrada have to get serious themselves – and decisive. Carrick may fulfil his brief but the board must still use the time bought by his interim appointment to identify a coach with serious credentials, then lure them to Old Trafford and do whatever preparation necessary for the next manager to hit the ground running.",
      "Can this board pull it off? Their record doesn’t inspire confidence. But United simply cannot emerge from a summer in which Thomas Tuchel, Luis Enrique, Julian Nagelsmann, Xabi Alonso and Carlo Ancelotti may be available under an interim done good.",
      "The centre-back ‘covered’ under Amorim is not a good enough ‘athlete’ to thrive under Carrick and is set to be ‘exposed’ in his Man Utd system.",
      "Three excellent centre-backs – well two very fine and one woefully out-of-form – are approaching free-agency, with Liverpool keen on at least two of them…",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’.",
      "There is, to nobody’s great surprise, a lot of nonsense about Michael Carrick’s first day in his new job as Manchester United interim manager.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?",
      "Man Utd legend Jaap Stam has outlined what the Red Devils should be looking for in their next permanent manager after sacking Ruben Amorim."

      "Therefore, there are real concerns that Frank is ‘not a good fit’ for Spurs, while a loss to West Ham United at the weekend could be the final straw.",

      "There are a lot of ifs, buts and maybes in this speculative report, but the point regarding an interim manager coming in is an obvious one to make and would likely be Tottenham’s course of action if/when they part ways with Frank.",
      "As Man Utd realised, there is a severe lack of credible long-term replacements available at the moment, but expiring contracts and the upcoming World Cup mean far more exciting candidates will be available in the summer.",
      "This is why the Red Devils have opted for Michael Carrick until the summer, with Spurs legend Roy Keane, who is among the favourites in the betting, a potential option to do a similar job for the time being.",
      "Thinking ahead, Crystal Palace is an ‘early contender’ to be Tottenham’s next permanent boss, but there are problems to overcome.",
      "The report claims: ‘Oliver Glasner has emerged as an early contender to take over from Frank if he is sacked in the coming weeks, and sources have outlined that Tottenham could turn to an interim chief to lead them until the Austrian’s contract at Crystal Palace expires.",
      "‘The 51-year-old is set to become a free agent this summer, and it is viewed as highly unlikely that Spurs would be able to tempt him away from Selhurst Park before then. However, there are several clubs that are showing an interest in Glasner, and an appointment would not be straightforward for the North Londoners.’",
      "So, would Glasner leave Palace to join Spurs now and give up the chance of having the choice of several top clubs in the summer? No chance.",
      "Therefore, a deal for Glasner is ‘highly unlikely’ now, and that should also be considered the case in the summer, because if Man Utd (or another elite club) come calling, he will surely go there and avoid the Spurs mess like the plague.",

      "“You have got to be pretty special to tick all four of those boxes and, as such, the outstanding candidate for me would be Carlo Ancelotti, even if it would mean potentially delaying his arrival until late July if Brazil reached the World Cup final.",

      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as clubs up and down the Premier League try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal rank as the most effective side, with Liverpool the least, but what are they doing differently?",
      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 14 January 2026 21:37, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Cheslea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "By using inswinging deliveries, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 4-1 win over Aston Villa, when Gabriel was able to put Emiliano Martinez under pressure and bundle Bukayo Saka's corner over the line from a few yards out.",
      "But there is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "When Ruben Amorim was sacked last week, people close to him told us the Portuguese coach had been surprised - and struggled - with the sheer volume of noise in and around Old Trafford. Amorim confided in his friends to say how impossible it was to fully prepare or predict what the unique challenges were of being the main man at Manchester United.",
      "United's bosses weren't about to make the same mistake twice.",
      "That is why United's shortlist of candidates for the interim head coach position was made up entirely of United old-boys. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick were to the fore.",
      "The club hierarchy, led by director of football Jason Wilcox, wanted someone who knows the club, who has experienced the pressure and the expectation, who would feel comfortable in a difficult environment where the spotlight is blinding, and where the mood among the fanbase is still filled with frustration, remembering glories past.",
      "Michael Carrick was up front and central in that glorious past. As a player under Sir Alex Ferguson, he won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one Club World Cup. His first taste of coaching was at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho, and he had short stints as caretaker boss, either side of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell in charge. United's bosses are as confident as they can be, that he will not be fazed by the environment he is stepping back into.",
      "It is clear the club's hierarchy didn't want to change head coach mid-season, but with poor results and a total breakdown in the relationship with Amorim, the club was forced to act. Many fans and commentators will ask why United couldn't appoint a new, high-profile manager straight away. But the reality is that Manchester United doesn't have the same pull for the world's elite coaches that it did a decade ago. There is no European football. Budgets are tight. There is still a major restructuring of the entire club taking place.",
      "And so it was sensible for the club to take a pragmatic approach, and save the big decision about the next big boss until the summer, when more big names will be available. Once that decision was made, it was a question of who would be best to run things for the remainder of the season, and give the team maximum chance to achieve European football for 2026/27.",
      "That man, it was decided, was Carrick. And even though he and no one else on the coaching staff has ever worked with Steve Holland before, there was a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable. Importantly, he was also available to start immediately, without the need to pay compensation.",
      "Other key factors in Carrick's appointment were his familiarity with the structure of power at United. Wilcox works closely with the head coach over strategy, philosophy and team selection. Ultimately, it was the significant differences of opinion and Amorim's reluctance to align tactically with Wilcox that saw him get the boot.",
      "Carrick has made it clear he is happy to work within United's existing systems, pointing out that he did so effectively at Middlesbrough, where he worked closely with head of football Kieran Scott. He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.",
      "Sometimes criticised for a lack of adaptability at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick stuck true to his footballing philosophy - one where dominating the football, and opposition, was the primary game plan. That idea, too, aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play.",
      "But what about the other main candidate, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?",
      "The noise from Solskjaer's camp early on was that he was not just interested in the role, he was the favourite. That was noticed inside Carrington with bemusement considering they were clear that no decision would be made until they sat down with the two candidates.",
      "Multiple sources have told us after meeting Carrick face-to-face last Thursday, United's leadership were left impressed. More so than for Solskjaer.",
      "As mentioned, his philosophy and tactical approach undoubtedly made an impact on the likes of Wilcox and Berrada but his willingness to take on the role with no guarantee of a permanent role at the end of the season was also to his advantage during the process.",
      "Solskjaer, it is understood, wanted a permanent option if he performed well in the role - a desire which the United hierarchy were not willing to entertain - clear that role was until the end of the season.",
      "It also has to be considered that a potential return for Solskjaer, who was manager under the previous regime, could be interpreted as a backward step. After consistent messaging around INEOS being forward-thinking, questions would have been asked about returning to a previous manager who did not necessarily succeed during his first spell at the club. Popular with the fan base, yes, but it was a difficult sell and not a good look.",
      "And so Carrick begins his limited reign as United's main man. As things stand, it is unlikely he will be considered for the longer-term role in the summer, alongside the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Marco Silva et al. But the hope is that his appointment will prove to be a positive one for both the coach, and the club which he now heads.",
      "He needs to hit the ground running, but he will be given a little leeway early on - Manchester City at home and Arsenal away - will prove a baptism of fire.",

      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup meaning they will only play 40 games this season; with the club out of both domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle and a league title highly unlikely this term - where do the managerless club go this season?",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 07:50, UK",
      "No manager, no trophy hopes, no noise. The final whistle against Brighton was met with a few boos, then stunned silence. Just where do Manchester United go from here?",
      "One statistic flew around United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton. 40 games - that is how long United's season will be. Their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, where there were no cup games due to the First World War.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",

      "As Manchester United look to their past once again, Adam Bate reports from Turf Moor after Darren Fletcher's first game in interim charge and argues that trying to recreate what's been lost since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement is not the way forward",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 08:53, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Darren Fletcher was denied victory in his first game as Manchester United’s interim head coach as Jaidon Anthony’s spectacular strike earned Burnley a 2-2 draw.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's second-half brace had turned the game around after Ayden Heaven's unfortunate own goal at Turf Moor but the Premier League strugglers found an equaliser as United missed the chance to go fourth just two days after Ruben Amorim's sacking.",
      "Burnley: Dubravka (8), Walker (6), Esteve (7), Laurent (7), Humphreys (8), Pires (6), Florentino (7), Ugochukwu (7), Edwards (8), Hannibal (6), Broja (6).\n\n\nSubs: Anthony (8), Foster (6), Sonne (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (6), Dalot (6), Heaven (6), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Ugarte (7), Casemiro (6), Dorgu (7), Fernandes (8), Cunha (6), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Mount (6), Yoro (6), Zirkzee (6), Mainoo (6), Lacey (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Burnley did not have a shot on target in the first half but they did not need one to lead at the break, Bashir Humphreys' cross deflected beyond Senne Lammens after taking a wicked deflection off the unfortunate Ayden Heaven that saw the ball loop into the net.",
      "United, playing in a 4-2-3-1 formation, had ample opportunities to level it up before the interval but Sesko had a hat-trick of chances saved by Martin Dubravka. Humphreys and Maxime Esteve cleared efforts off the line. Lisandro Martinez had a goal disallowed.",
      "Fletcher switched Matheus Cunha and Bruno Fernandes at the interval, the change reaping dividends with the skipper threaded a pass through for Sesko to finish emphatically. The Slovenian then converted Patrick Dorgu's cross for a second goal.",
      "Credit to Burnley for finding a response thanks to Anthony, the substitute cutting in on his left foot and firing an unstoppable shot high beyond Lammens. United youngster Shea Lacey almost responded in kind but saw his effort come back off the bar.",
      "Instead, it is a third straight draw for United - against Wolves, Leeds and Burnley. Fletcher was serenaded by the away support, nevertheless, as Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada looked on. A time of change off the pitch but another tough result on it.",
      "Man Utd interim head coach Darren Fletcher on Benjamin Sesko:",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs.",
      "\"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well. And like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, you hit the back of the net, it builds your confidence and hopefully it starts flowing for him from there.",
      "\"Everyone can see his qualities, I thought he was fantastic tonight, he led the line really well and maybe he could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",
      "\"It's a real positive night for him and definitely probably the biggest positive for the night really, his two goals, and hopefully that's good for Manchester United's future.\"",
      "\"The positive is Sesko scoring. Hopefully he gets some confidence. It's taken him six months to turn up but I'm pleased for him.",
      "\"He's had a tough run and I'd have had him off the pitch at half-time, never to wear a Manchester United shirt again. I stand by what I said, he's not good enough to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"He's turned up for one game against Burnley who are going to get relegated. Hopefully we start seeing something different from him.\"",
      "Burnley boss Scott Parker speaking in the press conference:",
      "\"Everything I demanded of the team and the team demanded of themselves was there. I wanted a reaction. We were bitterly disappointed by the overall performance and what we produced at Brighton. This was getting back to what we need to bring to a Premier League game of football.",
      "\"We started the game really well and to go 2-1 down, we needed a reaction and we produced that. It was an improvement for us as a team and overall a massive point for us and more importantly the character of the team in adversity, they stood up and got a result. It is definitely a stepping stone.\"",
