      "Benjamin Sesko has explained why he snubbed a move to Newcastle in favour of joining Manchester United. Sesko has become the latest addition to Ruben Amorim's new-look attack after joining from RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million.",
      "Sesko had a decision to make after both United and Newcastle entered negotiations with Leipzig for the Slovenia international. The 22-year-old striker has always been clear that he preferred to move to Manchester and has now signed a five-year contract with the club.",
      "United will pay the German side £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons, taking their spending in the summer transfer window to £207.5m, having already signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo for £71m from Brentford.",
      "Amorim's side won't play any European football in the 2025/26 season, having finished 15th in the Premier League last season and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham. Nevertheless, Sesko opted to join the rebuild project at Old Trafford, rather than continue to play in the Champions League by joining Newcastle.",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,\" he said. “When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Sesko scored 21 goals in 45 games across all competitions for Leipzig last season and will become United's primary option at centre-forward. Amorim's side scored just 44 goals in 38 league games in 2024/25, as Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee struggled to make an impact.",
      "Sesko has been linked with a move to the Premier League for a few years and was previously a target for Arsenal. But the Gunners opted instead to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon, leaving him with a choice between Newcastle and United.",
      "It is not the first time this summer that the Magpies have missed out on a transfer target, with Hugo Ekitike heading for Liverpool rather than Tyneside. Eddie Howe's side have managed to land Anthony Elanga, but are in a difficult position ahead of the start of the season next weekend after star striker Alexander Isak made it clear he wants to leave.",

      "Manchester United have officially won the race for Benjamin Sesko after hijacking Newcastle's move for the striker. Sesko, 22, arrives from German club RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will pay £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. Sesko has signed a five-year contract, keeping him at Old Trafford until June 2030.",
      "Newcastle had a bid accepted by Leipzig earlier this week but the Slovenia international preferred to move to Manchester. St James' Park chiefs offered to pay Leipzig £4m more than the Red Devils but were unable to convince the player.",
      "Sesko soon agreed personal terms and a club-to-club deal was reached on Thursday, allowing him to fly to Manchester that night alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic. After completing a medical at Carrington, which has been redeveloped this summer, the former Red Bull Salzburg wonder put pen to paper on his contract.",
      "The deal takes United's spending in the summer transfer window to £207.5m, having already signed two other forwards; Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Bryan Mbeumo for £71m. Sesko could make his debut next Sunday, as the Red Devils welcome Arsenal to Old Trafford to begin their 2025-26 Premier League campaign.",
      "Arsenal notably held talks over a move for the 22-year-old earlier this summer. But the Gunners ultimately decided on Viktor Gyokeres, who was initially United's top target.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell was crucial in securing Sesko's signature. Vivell brought him to Salzburg as a teenager before signing him for Leipzig in 2023.",
      "Sesko has also been on United's radar since he was 16. The Red Devils first looked at signing him from Slovenian club Domzale before he became a Red Bull asset.",
      "Speaking after his transfer was announced, the forward said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "During his two seasons in east Germany, Sesko scored 39 goals while providing eight assists in 87 appearances. He's already earned 41 caps for Slovenia, scoring six goals and representing them at Euro 2024 last summer.",
      "Will Benjamin Sesko be successful at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Sesko's speed and stature has drawn comparisons to Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, who also played for Salzburg before moving to the Bundesliga. At 6ft 5in, United hope that he'll adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "Their focus will now turn to midfield. Brighton's Carlos Baleba is understood to be a target after contact was made through intermediaries this week.",
      "The Red Devils also want to sell a host of players, with Chelsea in talks to buy Alejandro Garnacho. Sesko's arrival could also spell the end of United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who's available for around £40m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has delivered what Cristiano Ronaldo demanded after leaving Manchester United, according to Diogo Dalot. Ronaldo slammed the training facilities at United after leaving the club under a cloud in January 2023 and Ratcliffe has now unveiled changes at Carrington.",
      "United have returned from their pre-season tour of the United States and moved into a new first-team complex at their training ground. The renovations were undertaken during the 2024/25 season and were part of a £236million investment by Ratcliffe and his INEOS ownership group.",
      "The petrochemicals billionaire said United now “stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple” as one of the most recognisable brands in the world and needed a training ground to match their ambitions. It comes two and a half years after Ronaldo claimed nothing had changed between when he left for Real Madrid in 2009 and his return in 2021.",
      "\"Nothing changed, surprisingly,\" he said in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan. \"Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym. Even the kitchen, the chefs, whom I appreciate – lovely people. They stopped in time. It surprised me a lot.",
      "\"I thought I would see other things, technologies and infrastructure. Unfortunately, we see a lot of what I used to see at 21, 22 and 23 years old. It really surprised me. Since [Sir Alex] Ferguson left, I haven't seen an evolution at the club. Progress is zero. You have to tear it down and rebuild it.\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo’s criticism, his Portugal team-mate Dalot said: \"I'm sure he would love it if he would be able to see it. But overall I think the message was clear that this club deserved even more and all credit to Sir Jim and his team.\"",
      "He added: \"I think finally we're getting to a level where this club deserves and now it's up to us, on the pitch, to also match that standard. If we're talking about a club like Man United, we should have the best facilities in the world. The big thing that I like the most is now there's going to be no excuses.\"",
      "United finished a lowly 15th in the Premier League last season before losing the Europa League final. They have splashed the cash this summer, signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with a deal for Benjamin Sesko close, and will expect to see results on the pitch this season.",
      "“The club has to compete at the highest level that is appropriate to the size and history of the club,” Ratcliffe said. “While a world-class training facility won’t take us to that position alone, it is one of the key ingredients in the modern facility. Now we have one.",
      "“When I first came to Carrington two years ago, we had a presentation here. It was clear then. It is an excellent facility. It was [leading edge[ I am sure in 2000, but 25 years later it wasn’t at quite the level it needed to be for one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",

      "The Premier League will have begun this time next week but several of the summer's major transfer sagas are likely to be in play with Alexander Isak among them.",
      "Newcastle face a major decision when it comes to their star player, who is currently not part of the first-team squad. He's expressed a desire to leave and Liverpool are circling. The Magpies though want £150million before they consider letting Isak leave for pastures new.",
      "It remains to be seen as to whether the Reds will pay that much. Arne Slot is open to more players heading to Anfield but has been outspoken about the idea Liverpool have spent huge sums - pointing to the amount of players to have left.",
      "Manchester United meanwhile have announced the signing of Benjamin Sesko - which is another blow to Newcastle who also eyed the Slovenian. The Red Devils are now being linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "Alexander Isak has been left fuming after Newcastle made it clear to him that he will not be sold this summer - ending his hopes of a move to Liverpool.",
      "The Swede was told of the club's decision with the Telegraph reporting he did not take it well and will continue training away from the first-team. Isak has been informed that, until he accepts that he will not be getting the move away he wanted, he will not play for Newcastle after being left out of their pre-season games.",
      "Eddie Howe has been the club's spokesperson and had been open and honest about the possibility that Isak could leave the club after three years, but their Saudi Arabian have taken a hard line regarding their refusal to sell.",
      "“The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",

But that might not be the end of interest in Kiwior, as the Athletic report that he's keen to explore opportunities with clubs where he'd be considered a first-choice player.",

      "Nicolas Jackson's future may fund those moves but it could also be dependant on Newcastle's next move. They want a new striker and look to have missed out on Benjamin Sesko and are now weighing up their options.",
      "Chelsea are ready to accept around £50m after Nicolas Jackson told the club he wanted leave Stamford Bridge after two seasons at the Blues.",
      "Jackson has led the line for the club and been their first choice No 9 since joining from Villarreal but has seen two new strikers arrive this summer. The Senegal international was left out of Chelsea’s pre-season friendly against Bayer Leverkusen on Friday after it was agreed he could seek pastures new.",
      "It was understood that the west Londoners wanted around £80m before they let their striker leave, but that stance has since cooled. The Times now reports they would want a similar figure to the one they receive for Noni Madueke - which was £52m.",
      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba is understood to be Man Utd's top target, even if a deal will be difficult to complete this summer.",
      "The Seagulls have slapped a price tag north of £100m on the Cameroon international and are insistent they won’t sell before the start of this season. The player himself is also understood to be willing to wait another 12 months before becoming the latest big-money exit from The Amex.",
      "United will nevertheless try to get a deal done, but any proposal won’t include Toby Collyer. Reports had suggested the academy graduate could be used as a makeweight in a possible Baleba offer, but those appear wide of the mark.",
      "Eddie Howe admits that it is \"clear\" that he \"can't involve\" Alexander Isak at Newcastle whilst the noise around his future persists.",
      "Newcastle rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool last week after the striker told them he wanted to explore his options. Howe has not closed the door on Isak playing against but concedes, as things stand, he will remain on the outside.",
      "He said: \"We've had discussions and it's clear at the moment that we can't involve him with the group. I don't know how long that will be for, but that's the latest.\"",
      "We're back to keep you across all the latest transfer news and deals as we wait to see if some of the Premier League's biggest names will head for pastures new."

      "While Manchester United are weighing up a blockbuster approach for Carlos Baleba, some believe the club already have an even greater midfield prodigy in their midst. And these aren't just ordinary observers – we're talking about 10 Ballon d'Or winners.",
      "Earlier this week, it emerged that the Red Devils have set their sights on Brighton's Baleba, with manager Ruben Amorim keen to bring in a defensive midfielder after successfully strengthening his forward line. Brighton, however, are unwilling to part ways with the 21-year-old, who has effortlessly filled Moises Caicedo's sizeable shoes after the Ecuadorian left for Chelsea in 2023.",
      "Internally, United accept that signing Baleba this summer will be no easy task, as Brighton are expected to demand around £100million for the Cameroon star. Meeting that figure would push United's transfer outlay for the summer towards – and potentially beyond – the £300m mark with Benjamin Sesko also arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Considering the hefty asking price and the club's precarious financial state, many question whether the pursuit is worth it, particularly as United already boast a gifted young midfielder in Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old is seen as one of Europe's most exciting emerging players, underlined by his third-place finish in last year's Kopa Trophy – awarded to the best footballer under the age of 21 – trailing only Arda Guler and winner Lamine Yamal.",
      "The prize, introduced in 2018, is voted on by a panel of former Ballon d'Or winners – 10 of whom ranked Mainoo in their top three. That distinguished group features Michael Owen, Marco van Basten, Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud Gullit, Pavel Nedved, Matthias Sammer, Jean-Pierre Papin, Igor Belanov and Gianni Rivera.",
      "Mainoo missed out on this year's shortlist after a stop-start season disrupted by injuries, yet optimism remains high within United that he can rediscover the consistency and spark that made him the academy's latest breakout star.",
      "His current deal runs until 2027, with negotiations for an extension ongoing but paused since last year. United do hold an option to prolong his contract by an additional year, though that hasn't prevented exit rumours from swirling in recent months.",
      "Should uncertainty over Mainoo's future persist, United's pursuit of Baleba could gather pace. That said, securing one isn't necessarily contingent on pinning down the other.",
      "While both operate in central midfield, Baleba is a more orthodox ball-winning No. 6, whereas Mainoo excels at advancing possession and adding creative thrust.",
      "If anything, they'd form an electrifying pairing, combining energy and tenacity off the ball with incisive passing and fast, fluid interplay on it – precisely the dynamic Amorim is eager to cultivate in midfield.",
      "For the moment, Brighton retain the upper hand in any negotiations over Baleba. The player is under contract for another three years, and the Seagulls have built a reputation for driving hard bargains – banking big sums for the likes of Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White.",
      "Whether United choose to seriously test Brighton's resolve remains to be seen, but if they do, prising Baleba away will likely be a drawn-out and fiercely contested battle.",

    "body": [
      "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lee Sharpe was one of English football’s brightest young stars.",
      "Plucked from Torquay United by Sir Alex Ferguson at just 17, the talented winger quickly made his mark at Manchester United, becoming a key figure in the club’s resurgence in the early 1990s.",
      "Known for his skill on the pitch and photogenic good looks off it, Sharpe helped United secure three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup during his eight‑year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "But his life at the top came with its challenges. Ferguson was famous for his “hairdryer treatment,” and Sharpe often found himself on the receiving end.",
      "Speaking to The Sun, he recalled one brutal halftime dressing‑down after a poor performance at Anfield: “He gave me the biggest rollicking of my life and told me to sell my house, move my girlfriend back home and get out there and play!”",
      "The player followed those instructions, later adding: “He asked me now and then after that if I had a girlfriend or if I was married, but I always told him I’d got rid of my girlfriend, wasn’t getting married and not to ask me again!”",
      "As United rose to dominate the newly formed Premier League, Sharpe embodied the image of the modern footballer - talented, well‑paid and living life in the fast lane.",
      "But injuries and a loss of form saw his Old Trafford career stall, leading to moves to Leeds United and Bradford City before he finally retired from professional football in 2004. And that’s when Sharpe’s post‑football life took an unexpected turn.",
      "In 2005, just a year after hanging up his boots, Sharpe became a household name all over again - this time on television. He joined the cast of Celebrity Love Island, an early version of the now‑famous ITV dating show.",
      "There, he struck up a romance with TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, who told viewers she had “never felt like this about anyone before.” But their relationship didn’t survive the cameras - Sharpe famously dumped Middlemiss for fellow contestant Abi Titmuss before the series ended.",
      "The headlines didn’t stop there. Sharpe and Titmuss’ short‑lived romance soon fell apart amid allegations of cheating.",
      "In her memoir, Titmuss recalled the painful moment she discovered his alleged infidelity: “I feel like I’m being physically torn in half. I have my boyfriend looking me straight in the eye, telling me he loves me and totally denying it. And in my hand I have the front page of a national paper with a woman swearing he had slept with her.”",
      "It was the beginning of a tabloid storm. Over the following months, Sharpe was linked to promotions worker Kathryn Shaw - who described meeting him “on a little bridge near Rochdale” - and former Big Brother contestant Lisa Jeynes, who claimed they had a “marathon sex session that went on for hours.”",
      "Other rumoured relationships included actress Kym Marsh and singer Michelle Heaton, strengthening Sharpe’s reputation as one of football’s original playboys.",
      "But away from the gossip pages, Lee Sharpe's life was quietly beginning to change. By 2011, he had met Lucy Gardner, the woman who would become his wife.",
      "Six years later, he proposed at a Cheltenham Races fundraiser in front of more than 250 guests. “It was absolutely wonderful to witness,” said Cathryn Hage of the Pied Piper charity, which hosted the event.",

      "Life on the Spanish coast has given Sharpe a chance to step away from his headline‑grabbing past and pursue a new passion - golf.",

      "Former Manchester United ace Andreas Pereira has thrived since his move to Fulham in 2022. The Brazilian midfielder was sold at the start of Erik ten Hag's reign at Old Trafford.",
      "Pereira, who spent 11 years with the Red Devils, made his United debut as an 18-year-old. He clocked up 75 appearances for the first team, primarily under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, before being loaned out.",
      "The 29-year-old had stints at Lazio and Flamengo but his performances were not enough to stop new United boss Ten Hag from selling him three years ago. The academy product signed for newly-promoted Fulham and has flourished during his time at Craven Cottage.",
      "Transfermarkt estimates Pereira's worth at around £16m (€18m), which is double what Fulham initially paid. This is despite his recent dip in value as he enters the final year of his contract, though it's claimed that Fulham have the option to extend his deal for another year.",
      "In 2022, Pereira chose not to meet with Ten Hag, with whom he had a previous connection, as he was keen to part ways with United. However, the manager believed both parties had made the right decision when discussing the midfielder months after his departure.",
      "''Andreas Pereira is a really good player,'' Ten Hag said ahead of facing Pereira's Fulham in March 2023. ''I [have] known him already a long time, I had him in the youth team at PSV, before he transferred to Manchester United.",
      "''I am really happy for him and that he is progressing that well. I think it was the right step for him as I think he has to play on a regular basis.\"",
      "Pereira is hardly the only United academy graduate to flourish in the Premier League after departing Old Trafford. Recent seasons have seen Anthony Elanga and Dean Henderson shine for Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "Scott McTominay has been a sensation for Serie A champions Napoli, while former starlet Alvaro Carreras secured a big-money move to Real Madrid this summer, just a year after his sale to Benfica. Fulham ace Pereira has previously confessed that being sidelined at United fuelled his hunger to thrive at his new home, insisting he harbours zero regrets over his decision to leave.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I made in my life,\" Pereira told The Standard last year. \"To come to live and play here, to enjoy my football, to get back into the national team with great players, to enjoy my football in the Premier League, leaving is the best decision I made.",
      "\"The time I was there, I really enjoyed being at a fantastic club. But I don't regret leaving. We have this desire to show it was wrong that we didn't play.\"",
      "Despite United reportedly retaining a 20 per cent sell-on fee as part of Pereira's move to Fulham, they have yet to reap any benefits from the contract clause. Pereira credits Fulham boss Silva for reviving his career, which saw him return to the Brazil squad last year.",
      "\"He is responsible for everything that is happening in the club,\" Pereira said. \"He is responsible for me coming to Fulham. I will always be grateful for everything he has done for me. I have to show the trust he has in me by keeping doing what I am doing. He's been, for sure, the most important piece of our team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has achieved the first priority of the summer window - radically overhaul his attack. The Red Devils scored a paltry 44 goals in a Premier League season which saw them finish a desperate 15th.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent transfer is expected to be announced later today, after he completed his medical at Carrington on Friday. The £74million deal with RB Leipzig means United have now spent more than £200m on their new-look forward line which also included Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Now Amorim can turn his attention to the midfield, having gone public with his desire to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park. Along with that, is the unenviable task of offloading United’s unwanted and overpaid members of the ‘bomb squad’. Marcus Rashford has already departed, but the likes of Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are eagerly awaiting their own exits.",
      "After revamping and retooling his attack, Amorim is now on the lookout for a midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba is understood to be United’s top target, even if a deal will be difficult to complete this summer.",
      "The Seagulls have slapped a price tag north of £100m on the Cameroon international and are insistent they won’t sell before the start of this season. The player himself is also understood to be willing to wait another 12 months before becoming the latest big-money exit from The Amex.",
      "United will nevertheless try to get a deal done, but any proposal won’t include Toby Collyer. Reports had suggested the academy graduate could be used as a makeweight in a possible Baleba offer, but those appear wide of the mark.",
      "While Collyer is likely staying put, Garnacho is almost certain to leave during the current window. The Argentine has been deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim and is training away from the main group.",
      "But Garnacho has put his foot down regarding where he will go next, with a belief he’s made it clear that it’s Chelsea or nothing.",
      "For their part, the Blues are also keen to strike a deal, despite their riches in attacking areas. On Friday, Fabirizio Romano reported that the two parties had reached a total agreement on personal terms. It’s now down to the two clubs to strike a deal.",
      "A new goalkeeper could also be on Amorim’s agenda this summer after another inconsistent season by Andre Onana. Publicly at least, the manager has stuck with the former Inter stopper, but that hasn’t stopped links with potential replacements.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is at the top of that list, with his PSG future increasingly uncertain. The European champions are set to announce the signing of Lucas Chevalier, leaving Donnarumma free to look elsewhere.",
      "Could he make the move to English football? United would be silly not to look at it.",

      "Arne Slot accepts Liverpool are favourites for the Premier League title - but insists it shouldn’t be about the money they’ve spent.",
      "The Reds have splashed the cash this summer with their spending nearly reaching £300m and more to come. But the defending champions have raised almost £150m so far in player sales with further departures in the coming days and weeks before the window slams shut.",
      "The Liverpool boss said: “If you won it last season it's quite normal that you are part of the favourites again for next season. For me it would not be normal if it's about spending, because the net spend of us compared to the other teams is not in our favour, if you look at the last two seasons. But it's completely normal that we are one of the favourites, because we won it last season. And we brought in good players, like all the other ones did, by the way.”",
      "Liverpool only spent £10m last summer on Federico Chiesa while they earned more in outgoings. They’re set to smash the British transfer record with a £116m deal for Florian Wirtz while Alexander Isak would cost £120m at least to get from Newcastle this summer.",
      "Arsenal have spent close to £200m this summer and brought in just £9m while Manchester United's move for Benjamin Sesko will take their spending to the £200m mark with no money yet from outgoings. Manchester City have spent £151m in the summer but also splashed out in January and have made £42m this window. While Chelsea have also spent over £200m but raised over £100m as well.",
      "Slot added: “This is the Premier League, this is what makes this league so nice. I think there's only been one exception [who didn’t spend big] in the last two, three, four, five, six years, and that's been Liverpool last season.",
      "“Sunderland is spending money as if they... They have a lot of money, of course, because they're promoted. So that is what happens in the Premier League, that's why it is such a nice league.",
      "“So if we are only favourites because we've spent a bit, I would see that as weird, because we've lost a lot as well. But that we are favourites because we won it last season and we played so well, that's clear. And the ambitions haven't changed, because the ambition of this club is always to compete for every trophy.",
      "“So that hasn't changed compared to last season. Not because we lost players and not because we brought players in. The ambitions are always the same at this club.”",
      "Slot remained tight-lipped on the pursuit of Isak and the potential of an attacker coming in but they are ready to spend big if the Newcastle striker is available while a defender is also on the cards.",

Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho - ironically back in Manchester after Chelsea decided to pay a fine to cancel their summer transfer obligation - all remain in situ.",
      "Argentina international Garnacho looks the man most likely to be next through the exit door however. A regular under Ruben Amorim since his arrival, his talent isn’t in question, but the Portuguese has had enough of his attitude and the drama that comes with the 21 year-old.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” Amorim said earlier in the summer. His post-match comments after only being a substitute in the Europa League final were the final straw however.",
      "“I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that,” added Amorim. “So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge.\"",
      "Chelsea believe that Garnacho, not taken on United’s pre-season tour of the US, can shine for them in the Premier League. Garnacho believes that too.",
      "He is desperate to move to Stamford Bridge and has already agreed personal terms over a switch to west London.",
      "The question is whether Chelsea will meet United’s £50m price tag. That’s considerably lower than the £80m the Red Devils were asking for in January when Napoli came calling, but positions have changed; United are, clearly, no longer so keen to keep him while Napoli instead moved on Noa Lang.",
      "Plus, United could do with bringing in some money having spent over £200m on their new-look attack of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe believes Manchester United now have a “world-class facility” following the £50m transformation of the club's training ground - befitting a brand that \"stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "The Red Devils have called Carrington home since January 2000, when they left their longstanding base, The Cliff, to move into a facility that cost £14.3m to build at the time. The training ground has undergone renovations over the past 25 years but had fallen behind many Premier League clubs, leading United to announce plans to turn it into a state-of-the-art complex last June.",
      "The renovation work was completed during the 2024-25 season and Ruben Amorim’s squad moved into the men’s first team building this week having returned from their pre-season tour of the United States. Ratcliffe’s $300m (£236.7m at the time of the agreement) infrastructure investment as part of the deal to become minority owner funded a project that he believes will help United in their fight to return to the top.",
      "“This is one of the most recognised brands in the world,” the United co-owner said during a ceremony in which he cut a red ribbon in front of the first-team squad, club leadership and staff. “It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "“The club has to compete at the highest level that is appropriate to the size and history of the club. While a world-class training facility won’t take us to that position alone, it is one of the key ingredients in the modern facility. Now we have one.",
      "“When I first came to Carrington two years ago, we had a presentation here. It was clear then. It is an excellent facility. It was (leading edge) I am sure in 2000 but 25 years later it wasn’t at quite at the level it needed to be for one of the top four or five clubs in the world.",
      "“It was the first big decision when we arrived in the first quarter of 2024, to invest in this training facility. There were lots of naysayers, who said ‘that won’t be done in 12 months’…but I am pleased to say the project has come in on budget and on time.”",
      "Foster + Partners – also appointed last September to develop a masterplan for the Old Trafford stadium district – led the biggest upgrade to Carrington since it opened at the turn of the millennium. The club say it has been “designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence”, with top-tier equipment and technology throughout a building that is light and open.",
      "Reflecting on the old building, Ratcliffe said: “Downstairs, there weren’t many windows on the ground floor. It felt like you were in a hospital in the basement. It was a slightly gloomy place, a gloomy rabbit warren. Now it is open, fresh, quite modern. It encourages interaction. That is what we needed.”",
      "The medical areas have been vastly improved and players’ wellbeing has been at the forefront of the plans, which has even included a barbers being built next to the restaurant.",
      "Chief operating officer Collette Roche, who led the project, said: “I’m really, really proud of the team. As you know, with any project, it’s complex, and we’ve had to work in an environment while there’s lots of things going on in the background, lots of change in the club, and also make sure that we kept everything running.",
      "“So, it’s been fantastic, on budget and on time and I think it just proves, for me, if you do a project of this size and scale, and you involve people, and you plan it in the right way, just how amazing and transformative it can be.”",

      "Manchester United could turn to much cheaper alternatives if they are ultimately priced out of a move for Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder has emerged as a potential target for Ruben Amorim, who is keen to strengthen his midfield ahead of his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have reportedly made contact with the Seagulls, who could ask for around £100m for Baleba, as he still has three years remaining on his contract. United are believed to value him at closer to £70m, and it's been suggested that Baleba might request Brighton to reduce their asking price.",
      "If any deal were to happen, though, United would need to offload further players to help boost their spending power.",
      "To add further intrigue, Manchester City are also believed to be monitoring Baleba, who cost Brighton £23.2m when they signed him from Lille in 2023. If City don’t swoop in, United could decide to wait until a later transfer window, by which time Brighton’s asking price may have dropped.",
      "But if Amorim determines that he needs midfield reinforcements before the September 1 deadline, here are some other, cheaper alternatives…",
      "Monaco’s highly-rated 21-year-old, who has previously been linked with Tottenham, could be an option. An asking price of around the £53m mark – almost half of what it could cost to sign Baleba – has been reported.",
      "Camara has already impressed at an English ground, starring for Senegal during their 3-1 friendly victory over England at the City Ground. Suited to the pressing game Amorim wants to play, Camara is adept at both stopping and starting attacks.",
      "There are a number of other cheaper options United could turn to, including Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney, 22. Having played under former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who was sacked by Boro earlier this summer, Hackney knows how to look after the ball.",
      "He also does an excellent job out of possession too, with the ability to cover a lot of ground. Having not played in the Premier League, he would be one for the future, but could be a very wise investment.",
      "It seems a matter of of time before Agoume finds himself in the Premier League, with Arsenal believed to hold an interest in the Sevilla middleman.",
      "The 23-year-old starred for France at the recent European Under-21 Championship, his final age-group tournament. He will now be looking to take his game to the next level for both club and country.",
      "A lofty, combative midfielder, Agoume doesn’t take any prisoners, which could be just what Amorim’s midfield needs. He’s not lacking technically either and is capable of swashbuckling runs forward.",
      "A more unlikely target compared to the aforementioned trio but Wharton could still be a cheaper option than Baleba. The England midfielder was linked with Liverpool earlier this summer, with a fee of £75-80m mooted.",
      "Contracted to Palace until 2029 and with no release clause, the FA Cup winners are in a mightily strong position when it comes to one of their prized assets. However, given his immense quality, interest in him is sure to grow. United should be keeping tabs on his situation.",

At the time of writing, United are yet to confirm Sesko’s switch to Old Trafford - but an announcement is not far off. It's expected the 22-year-old will officially be unveiled in front of fans ahead of the club’s pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",

      "Reports in Italy have claimed that chiefs from the Italian side will fly to the UK to hold talks with their Red Devils colleagues. But Hojlund’s stance could put a deal in jeopardy, having expressed his desire to stay at Old Trafford.",

      "Tyrell Malacia may not yet have got his transfer, but the Manchester United star has responded after one of his former Feyenoord team-mates got their summer switch. Malacia's old pal in Rotterdam, Toshio Lake, has secured a move to Belgian outfit Olympic Charleroi.",
      "Lake's move comes with Malacia's future anything but certain. He was one of the five players who made up Ruben Amorim's so-called 'Bomb Squad' after expressing a desire to leave Old Trafford this summer. The others, of course, were Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Of the five, only Rashford has actually got his move, the England international joining Barcelona on loan for the season. Dutch international Malacia spent the second half of last term out on loan himself, at PSV Eindhoven. However, they elected not to exercise their option to make the move permanent.",
      "The defender commented on Lake's post that carries the caption 'Home stretch. Matthew 5:14-16 \"You are the light of the world\", proclaiming: \"God is great.\"",
      "United striker Joshua Zirkzee, another of his team-mates during their time together at Feyenoord, responded by saying: \"Love it bro go get em !!\"",
      "In an interview last year with Status Pro Sport, his management company, Lake mentioned he still keeps in regular contact with Malacia and Zirkzee. \"I still speak to almost everyone, some more than others,\" he noted.",
      "\"At Feyenoord, I played with a lot of really good guys: Joshua Zirkzee, Ramon Hendriks, Quilindschy Hartman, the Timber brothers [Jurrien and Quinten], Lutsharel Geertruida and Tyrell Malacia. And then I'm probably forgetting a bunch.",
      "\"With the Dutch national team, there were Bryan Brobbey, Nigel Thomas, Mohammed Ihattaren, and I could go on. I still have a lot of contact with Joshua Zirkzee and Quinten Timber, but perhaps the most with Tyrell Malacia.",
      "\"Tyrell and I went through a phase where we were both injured at the same time. Then you really support each other through the process. I talk a lot about God with Quinten; he really helped me get closer to God.\"",
      "It comes as ex-United forward Dimitar Berbatov urges Amorim to block any sale of Rasmus Hojlund this summer - despite the imminent arrival of Benjamin Sesko.",

      "The Red Devils have agreed a £74m deal with his current side, and Sesko has flown to the UK to undergo a medical with United. Once a deal is rubber-stamped, that could see the door opened to Hojlund exiting Old Trafford.",
      "Italian side AC Milan hold an interest in the Danish striker and, according to Corriere dello Sport, have flown to the UK to hold talks. It is suggested that the Red Devils are keen to send Hojlund out on loan.",
      "Milan would happily take the striker on a temporary deal but want a £30m option to buy inserted into any arrangement. That would represent a huge loss on the £72m that United spent to sign Hojlund from Italian side Atalanta in 2023.",
      "The 22-year-old has gone on to score 26 goals in 95 appearances in all competitions since then. While United are open to letting him leave, Hojlund has made his preference very clear - to stay in Manchester.",
      "Speaking on the club’s pre-season tour, he said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "\"I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Hojund has three years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford but will fall down the pecking order once Sesko is signed. The Slovenian scored 21 goals in all competitions last term for Leipzig.",
      "His signing is all part of a big recruitment drive from Ruben Amorim’s side as they attempt to add more goals following a dire campaign last time out. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have both already been signed for a combined £133m.",

      "Carlos Baleba has been strongly advised to reject any future advances from Chelsea. The Manchester United target has been linked with many top clubs over the past 12 months, but a former Cameroon star thinks Liverpool would be his best fit.",
      "United are reportedly weighing up a move for the 21-year-old box-to-box star this summer after a breakout campaign on the south coast. However, Brighton are understood to be seeking a fee of around £104million for the player, who is also attracting interest from Manchester City.",
      "Former Cameroon striker Bernard Tchoutang represented the country on 42 occasions, winning the African Nations Cup in 2000. And he has told his compatriot that a move to United's greatest nemeses would suit him the most, but thinks Chelsea should be avoided at all costs.",
      "\"For me, Liverpool is the club that would suit him best,\" Tchoutang told AfricaFoot earlier this year. \"And I’m not just saying that because they’re by far the best team in the Premier League this season and one of the strongest in Europe.",
      "\"Arne Slot’s system of play would suit him very well. The Reds like to attack, press and make quick transitions. We also know that this is a club that knows how to trust young players and give them responsibility.",
      "\"As for Chelsea, I’m not sure it would be a good choice. The team is having a decent season, but it’s a step below Liverpool or Arsenal. And I think that Baleba has what it takes to play for one of the best teams in England! He’s ready for it and he’s working hard for it.\"",
      "Chelsea and Liverpool are not actively being linked with the midfielder, but have shown interest in him in the past. United are thought to be Baleba's biggest admirers considering a deal this summer, though the club are aware that agreeing a transfer for him will be incredibly difficult.",
      "Baleba joined Brighton from Lille in the summer of 2023 as part of a £23.m deal. Fast forward two years, and Fabian Hurzeler's side are reportedly hoping to fetch almost four times that amount if they're to part ways with the player this summer.",
      "It seems highly unlikely Ruben Amorim's side will be able to compete for Baleba's signature this summer on the current terms. United have agreed a £74m deal to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, which would take their summer spending to just north of £200m, and have already ruled out using Toby Collyer in a swap deal to save them some money up front.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, appear unlikely to move for a new midfielder after the quartet of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Dzobozslai, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones helped fire them to Premier League glory last season. They've also got Stefan Bajcetic back following his loan at Las Palmas, though reports suggest a loan move to Celtic could be in the offing.",
      "As for Chelsea, their midfield also appears settled as the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Romeo Lavia look set to rule the roost. The Blues were also hit with £78.5m in UEFA fines, £51m of which is suspended, just last month for failing to comply with spending restrictions.",
      "Worryingly for United, that could leave City in the best position to meet Brighton's demands and sign Baleba this summer. Pep Guardiola already recruited £46m Tijjani Reijnders to replace Kevin De Bruyne, though City's summer spending has been relatively modest compared to some rivals, while Brighton are said to be extremely reluctant to cash in on him at the moment.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov believes Benjamin Sesko's arrival at Manchester United provides the competition Ruben Amorim should desire with Rasmus Hojlund. The Danish striker endured a lacklustre season with the Red Devils last term, scoring just four Premier League goals.",
      "As a result, Ruben Amorim has wasted very little time in bolstering his front line this summer, securing the services of Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million move, and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a package worth up to £71m. However, it now appears as though United will see RB Leipzig sensation Sesko also join the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old has been a highly sought-after prospect this summer as a result of impressing in the Bundesliga, with the Red Devils and Newcastle United embroiled in a tug-of-war for his signature. And it now appears as though United have walked away victorious in their pursuit, with Sesko landing in the UK for a medical on Friday after a deal totalling £73.7m was agreed.",
      "And as a result, Hojlund will now have stiff competition for his place. It's something that Berbatov, who scored 56 goals and provided 27 assists during his time under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2008 and 2012, believes may allow the youngster to flourish if he adopts the right mentality.",
      "\"I watched how they moved, how they bullied defenders, how they scored goals, but then going to the Premier League, they found it difficult to adjust. And the stats speak for themselves, right? Three goals, four goals, for a striker you are going to be disappointed with yourself.",
      "\"So it's not easy, and is it the speed? Is it the new team? Is it the new environment? Is it most of the time the expectation people put on you because when you are number nine of United, you need to score goals, you need to perform, this is your job, this is your job description.",
      "\"Of course, there is so much more to being number nine. Dropping down deep, getting the ball, then releasing your team-mates. Running of course, defending when you need to defend, release the spaces for the other team-mates. It's a lot more to [being a] number nine these days, but ultimately it's about the goals you score.",
      "\"It was difficult campaign for them and it's a difficult period that they are going through, and now with another striker coming in, of course the competition is going to be high. When you buy a striker now you start to think, 'Well am I going to play? Is my place in United? Am I still belonging here? Do I need to start looking for a club?'",
      "\"Or maybe then you start thinking, 'Alright, I like the competition. Now I'm going to show you. Now I'm going to fight for my place. Now I'm going to bring the fire.'",
      "\"So it's a two-way scenario. You choose the one I said or the other. So let's see what they are going to bring to the table as well.\" Berbatov also explained that Amorim must make Hojlund feel wanted and valued should he hope to get the best out of him in the future, and that competition could turn out to be positive for the youngster.",
      "He added: \"You always want the competition, but at the same time, as a striker, because we think we're special, you need to feel welcome and wanted in the team, by the coach, by everybody.",
      "\"Then your motivation is going to be higher and your self-esteem is going to be higher. It's a lot of factors. It's not easy, but it's all in the head.\"",
      "For that to happen, Amorim would need to block any incoming transfer interest for Hojlund as the summer transfer window starts to draw to a close. At present, United are willing to let Hojlund part ways with Old Trafford for around £30m, despite the striker insisting that he wants to stay and fight for his place.",
      "With Hojlund already on Berbatov's way of thinking, it's up to Amorim to change the board's stance on the player to see if healthy competition truly allows him to flourish in a fresh season. However, it now appears AC Milan are set to approach the Red Devils to take him to the San Siro on loan for the new season.",
      "A change of scenery could also, of course, help benefit Hojlund as he looks to find his footing again, especially since he has previously excelled in Serie A. The youngster scored 10 goals in 34 appearances for Atalanta before United signed him in a £72m deal back in 2023, and a temporary move to Milan could allow him to develop his game and return stronger than before next year.",

      "Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes has congratulated former team-mate Scott McTominay for his Ballon d'Or nomination. Fernandes, 30, was not included in the exclusive list after United's poor campaign last season.",
      "The best part of a year ago, McTominay parted ways with the Red Devils to move to Napoli. He instantly adapted to life in Serie A and quickly made a big impression on Antonio Conte.",
      "The Scot ended the campaign with 13 goals and six assists in 36 appearances in all competitions, as Napoli stormed to the Scudetto. His stellar performances earned him a place him among the elite of world football.",
      "He will be competing for the prize alongside Treble-winning Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembele, 17-year-old Barcelona sensation Lamine Yamal, ex-Leeds United star Raphinha, and many other top talents.",
      "McTominay's exit at United was orchestrated by ex-boss Erik ten Hag as part of a strategy to raise funds for a new central midfielder. United made a tidy sum of £25.7m in pure profit from the sale of the Scottish international.",
      "That was put towards the signing of Manuel Ugarte, who arrived from PSG for £42.1m with potential add-ons of £8.4m, but the sale of McTominay now looks like a big error of judgement.",
      "Despite missing out on the nomination, Fernandes showed his class by posting a personal congratulations to McTominay.",
      "He uploaded a post from the official Ballon d'Or Instagram account with the caption: \"Buzzing for you my friend.\"",
      "McTominay is set to find out where he ranks among the world's best at the 69th Ballon d'Or ceremony, scheduled for September 22 at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.",
      "Despite his exit from Old Trafford, McTominay, during a recent interview at Wimbledon, showed no animosity to his former side.",
      "He said: \"I always want the absolute best for Manchester United, it's been my life for 22-23 years. For me, I wish the club all the success in the world and I'll be with them every step of the way. I want them to do well.\"",
      "In another interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, he admitted his move to Naples was a huge step in his career and life. He said: \"It gives you more mental strength. I've always lived very close to my mum, so I could go whenever I wanted.",
      "\"Now I live 1,500 miles away so I can't just go home and see my mum, my family, my sister and my kids so it's different. But in life you sometimes have to take yourself out of your comfort zone and I've always prided myself on that.",
      "\"I would never want to be in my comfort zone, and if I can go away anywhere and establish myself and do well, why not? Who's to stop me doing that?\"",
      "While McTominay won Serie A, United endured a miserable campaign which saw them finish 15th. Their one chance of redemption in the Europa League also saw them lose 1-0 in the final to Tottenham Hotspur, ruling out any chance of them qualifying for Europe.",

      "Garnacho is out of favour at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim adding Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to his attacking options after falling out with his No.17. The Argentine was left at home while the Red Devils went to the United States for pre-season, with the expectation being that he will leave before deadline day.",
      "Garnacho is desperate to move to Stamford Bridge, having made Chelsea his first choice this summer and the 21-year-old has agreed personal terms. However, it will of course count for nothing without an agreement on the fee.",
      "United's asking price of £50m appears to be too steep for the Blues at the time of writing. There had been suggestions the Red Devils might pursue a part-exchange deal involving Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson, but their move for Benjamin Sesko appears to have put an end to those conversations.",
      "The asking price is lower than in January, when Chelsea and Napoli were both keen on Garnacho. Since then, though, the winger's stock has fallen as it has become clear Amorim doesn't see him as a regular starter.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” Amorim said earlier in the summer. \"But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",
      "\"But I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that. So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge.\"",
      "United have already offloaded one other member of their so-called 'bomb squad', with Marcus Rashford joining Barcelona on a season-long loan. The England international could move to Camp Nou permanently if he impresses during the campaign, with Barca holding an option.",
      "The club still hope to offload Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia after the trio ended last season out on loan. Real Betis remain keen on keeping Antony in Seville after he impressed there last term, while Sancho has attracted interest from Serie A despite Chelsea opting against a permanent swoop following a year on loan at Stamford Bridge.",
      "United will play their final pre-season friendly at home to Fiorentina on Saturday before beginning their Premier League campaign against Arsenal. Chelsea won't have Garnacho in time for their friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan this weekend, but he could arrive in time for their league opener against Crystal Palace.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko arrives at Old Trafford for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, and the striker has signed a five-year contract.",
      "United were confident Sesko preferred a move to Manchester over Newcastle and moved swiftly to wrap up a deal. Newcastle submitted a more lucrative package, but Sesko's preference was decisive.",
      "In a statement, United said: \"Manchester United is pleased to confirm that Benjamin Sesko has joined the club, subject to registration. The Slovenia international has signed a contract until June 2030.",
      "\"Over the past two seasons, Sesko has scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe’s top five leagues. The 22-year-old scored 21 goals and registered six assists for RB Leipzig during the last campaign.",
      "\"He has already been capped 41 times and scored 16 goals for Slovenia since becoming his country's youngest-ever debutant in 2021.\"",
      "After Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale, United turned their attention to Sesko. This summer was earmarked for a move away from Leipzig for Sesko, who attracted interest from Arsenal at the beginning of the window.",
      "United were interested in signing Sesko in the summer of 2022 and his agent visited Carrington, but the forward decided to sign for Leipzig from the fellow Red Bull franchise FC Salzburg.",
      "Sesko is regarded as one of Europe's most exciting young centre-forwards. He scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has netted 16 goals in 41 games for Slovenia's national team.",
      "The 22-year-old travelled to Manchester in a private jet on Thursday evening alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic, to complete his transfer to United.",
      "The confirmation of Sesko's transfer means Ruben Amorim has overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League.",
      "United spent an initial combined £127.5m to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively. United have deliberately gone for Premier League-proven players, but staff believe Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers.",
      "Sesko's move creates uncertainty for Rasmus Hojlund. United are prepared to make a PSR loss on Hojlund this summer and are understood to be willing to listen to offers in the region of £30m.",

      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford.",

Ruben Amorim's decision to banish the bad eggs has also helped morale in the dressing room. The positivity is back at Old Trafford and long may it continue.",
      "I had to write up the Sesko announcement from inside the Munich Tunnel because the press room was not open when the deal was confirmed, although I have nobody except myself to blame after reading the email wrongly on the timings for today's game. Over 60,000 tickets have been sold this afternoon and more fans will come to pay on the gate just to see Sesko in the flesh. Sesko comes attached with risk, but he is a hugely exciting arrival and will add a sprinkle of unpredictability to the attacking line.",
      "Following the addition of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, United are now up to four first-team signings this summer - and they do remain in the market for more.",

      "Ahead of today's pre-season finale against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, our United writers have had their say on how they would like to see the Reds line up:",
      "The Premier League season is now just a week away, so the starting team for the final pre-season friendly of the summer should reflect which players Ruben Amorim is likely to start against Arsenal.",
      "With that in mind, Harry Maguire should start. Leny Yoro, Matthijs d Ligt and Maguire is the strongest back three combination, and the England international has been getting up to speed after a small injury.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are an unconvincing partnership, but Manuel Ugarte didn't cover himself in glory in the States. In attack, Bryan Mbeumo should start on the right after making his first appearance in the final USA game.",
      "With Andre Onana not expected to feature, I would like to see Tom Heaton given another opportunity in goal. He was excellent in the second half against Leeds and impressed in the win over Bournemouth.",
      "If Amorim is planning to use the visit of Fiorentina to deploy an XI as close to the one he plans to unleash against Arsenal, Yoro, De Ligt and Ayden Heaven should make up the back three.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are the leading candidates to start in the wing-back positions. The latter was particularly impressive during the tour.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte could start in midfield alongside each other for the first time this pre-season. United have seen the best and the worst of the latter this summer.",
      "Mbeumo deserves another start after making his bow in Atlanta against Everton. Matheus Cunha and Rasmus Hojlund should complete the attack.",

      "After trips to Sweden and the United States, United will conclude their pre-season schedule on home soil this lunchtime.",

      "Diogo Dalot is still close to Cristiano Ronaldo. So will he show Carrington's staunchest critic any imagery of its renovation?",
      "\"If he asks me, probably yes,\" Dalot smiles. \"I'm sure he would love it if he would be able to see it. But overall I think the message was clear that this club deserved even more and, like I said, all credit to Sir Jim and his team.\"",
      "To the naked eye, the exterior of the main building at Manchester United's Carrington training complex is no different. Inside, it is oak-panelled upstairs and downstairs, with open office spaces, enough natural light to gain vitamin D and even with a press conference room.",
      "The labyrinthine corridors of the old Carrington are gone. Benjamin Sesko should not struggle to find his way around.",
      "United's players provided input. \"Obviously, before the construction started, we had a talk,\" Dalot says. \"So obviously we gave some insights of what we would like to have, especially in terms of performance, space for us to be together, for us to create this culture.",
      "\"Also to create a good environment in the team where we can spend some time together also doing everything that is related to recover well and be at the highest level to perform.",
      "\"So I think altogether they did a fantastic job.\"",
      "Tom Heaton trained at Littleton Road and The Cliff before United relocated to Carrington in 2000, having identified the land in 1996. That project cost £13million. Its revamp was £50m and came in on budget.",
      "\"At the time it felt like a big mark or a pivotal moment in the football club,\" Heaton says. \"Incredible facilities at the time. But as time goes through and ideas modernise and the game evolves and things evolve with it, we still had everything we needed but it wasn't quite up to what we wanted.\"",
      "The opening of the new facilities started with a nod to the old guard. Kath Phipps, the longest United employee on record, was remembered by Sir Alex Ferguson as he unveiled a plaque in tribute to the 55-year club stalwart who passed away in December.",
      "It is displayed on the wall behind where her desk used to be. Kath would greet us as we strolled in before we turned right to enter the old press conference room. That space will become a gym reserved for staff.",
      "\"She was a sweetheart,\" Sir Alex Ferguson said. \"An absolute sweetheart. This was her life. When she lost her husband 20 years ago, this was her life every day. Loved by everyone, an exceptional person.",
      "“I'm going to unveil this and thank her for the wonderful person she was, and for Manchester United.”",
      "Our tour started with nothing that had changed. The gym is the same school sports hall it was when a handful of us toured Carrington in 2022. A shop-window hub has been added for the sports scientists to record the players' metrics.",
      "Through the doors is an entirely new recovery room with mats laid out for yoga and pilates. A high-altitude training room, one of the most noticeable investments. Multiple players can use it so that no one feels isolated.",
      "Not everything has been upgraded. The swimming pool that was redecorated after private criticism from Ronaldo is the same but the sauna, steam room and recovery have been remodelled.",
      "One of the major pieces of groundworks was a brand new basement that was dug into the building to accommodate the new steam and sauna, cold and hot plunge pools, and the hydroworks. That can be raised to ground level for players during their rehabilitation from a serious injury. They can walk onto it before they are lowered to a specific height and body weight for them to run on a treadmill under water. Their movements are monitored on screens on the nearby wall.",
      "Staff felt the previous saunas and steam rooms were smaller and hidden away. The designers were instructed to make them more open.",
      "Back to the new: a \"halfway-house\" dressing room has been added for the 'emerging talent', such as Chido Obi, Diego Leon and Sekou Kone, as neither have a first team space yet. The academy will continue to be housed in their own building across the main car park, adjoined to the women's team.",
      "The first team dressing room is reminiscent of the home room at Old Trafford, but vaster. Iced baths are in the shower area and monitoring room, as well as smart urinals that can measure if a player is dehydrated. One padel court will be installed amid the sport's popularity with players and staff.",
      "Matheus Cunha's and Bryan Mbeumo's lockers are the closest to the new dressing room's entrance. By each player's name there is a screen charting their schedule for the week: when to report for training (9.30am), training times, days off and matchdays. Jadon Sancho's space is buried away in the corner, the only name without a number.",
      "Staff spoke of the \"player journey\", inspired by the LA Rams' training base that United staff visited last year. At United, this is a red line from the training pitches back into the building via the rear. The image that greets the players is of euphoric United players and supporters celebrating Harry Maguire's 121st-minute winner against Lyon in April.",
      "United have relocated to their usual first team pitches, designed to replicate Old Trafford's, behind the Jimmy Murphy Centre. That building will be repurposed, possibly for hospitality guests and meet-and-greets.",
      "The women used portakabins between the Jimmy Murphy Centre and main hub last season. They have now returned to their designated quarters that opened in 2024. United believe their facilities are among the best for a women's team in Europe.",
      "Ferguson expressed his regret that the Carrington gym did not face the pitches to provide players recovering from injury an extra incentive. The compromise is the new treatment room, which has been described as \"transformational\" as it offers a vista of the pitches.",
      "Natural light flows in. Staff likened the old medical room to a \"dungeon\". \"It's a medical space with a hospitality feel,\" one of the architects said of the upgrade. Next to it is a state-of-the-art passive recovery room with sleeping pods, flotation tanks, an oxygen chamber, red light therapy and cryotherapy that allow players to switch off and have mindfulness.",
      "In the past, some players have conducted their rehabilitation away from Carrington. United intend to keep the players on site for as often as possible and expect them to remain on site longer to maximise the new facilities.",
      "Down the corridor is a room with MRI and CTE scanners and a whole-body scanner. That can scan an athlete in seven minutes and get a complete breakdown of their body composition, the bone mineral density, how much body fat they have and their muscle-mass, which can then be tracked over the course of the campaign.",
      "United figures are confident they are now among the best-equipped football clubs in the world with all three scanners and medicals can be conducted entirely at Carrington.",
      "The staircase to the upper floor is adorned by United's major trophies: the Premier League crown, the FA Cup, the League Cup, the European Cup, and individual honours to remind the players what they are striving for. Players and staff are encouraged to mingle away from offices.",
      "Upstairs, the players' briefing room is next door to the coaching staff room. It is fitted with 30 snug Italian leather chairs in three rows of ten. A tactics board is present while a large screen provides footage of the most recent match with a smaller screen to the left listing the relevant data. The players have already likened it to a cinema room.",
      "Nearby is the open working space, akin to the Ineos offices in Knightsbridge. United's analysts were sat together a day before the final pre-season friendly with Fiorentina.",
      "Meeting rooms are also available for more private conversations. Ruben Amorim still has his own office but is happy to collaborate openly. Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada have their own \"private spaces\". The recruitment hub is at the far end of the room.",
      "Consideration was given to flexibility of space, natural light and natural ventilation. The architects provided higher ceilings to create an environment that is more joyful and can maintain longer concentration levels.",
      "Where there was once the dead space of a grey balcony that was seldom used amid the notorious Manchester weather is now the first team's de facto lounge. A barbershop and a F1 simulator room have been installed by the relaxing dining area that looks out onto the academy pitches.",
      "Some hair was already on the floor. Heaton confirmed it was Dalot's. \"Not to throw any names under the bus, he's over there!\" Heaton chuckled. \"First in, he'd have been odds-on favourite for his haircut first as well.\"",
      "Players have been encouraged to personalise the communal area that features eight chairs and two sofas next to their dining area. New kitchens have been installed.",
      "Round the corner is another open office space for non-football staff. United's workforce has been slashed to 700 since Ratcliffe assumed control of football operations and 500 employees are due to relocate to Carrington from Old Trafford in September",
      "Staff were previously boxed into windowless rooms and United wanted facilities. Now they can work with the Carrington boardroom visible, although it has curtains for sensitive meetings.",
      "Our tour ended in the new 80-seater room where Amorim will hold court. The irony is it was designed so vastly in compliance with Uefa regulations. United's new hub is befitting a Champions League team.",
      "Ferguson often used to drive from the players' car park to the main car park for press conferences in the academy building. Now there are new studios for media interviews and signing unveilings so media commitments are more seamless. There is a dedicated working area for journalists outside.",
      "Ronaldo would approve.",

      "United returned from their pre-season tour of the United States with an upbeat mood flowing through the camp after a productive fortnight on the other side of the Atlantic. They also returned with a trophy after winning the Premier League Summer Series.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim has shuffled his pack throughout pre-season, making six changes from game to game, meaning he could follow suit again in M16. Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up...",
      "The Premier League season is now just a week away, so the starting team for the final pre-season friendly of the summer should reflect which players Amorim is likely to start against Arsenal.",
      "With that in mind, Maguire should start for the first time this summer. Yoro, De Ligt and Maguire is the strongest back three combination, and the England international has been getting up to speed after a small injury.",
      "Mainoo and Fernandes are an unconvincing partnership, but Ugarte didn't cover himself in glory in the States. In attack, Mbeumo should start on the right after making his first appearance in the final USA game.",
      "With Onana not expected to feature, I would like to see Heaton given another opportunity in goal. He was excellent in the second half against Leeds and impressed in the win over Bournemouth.",
      "If Amorim is planning to use the visit of Fiorentina to deploy an XI as close to the one he plans to unleash against Arsenal, Yoro, De Ligt and Heaven should make up the back three.",
      "Amad and Dorgu are the leading candidates to start in the wing-back positions. The latter was particularly impressive during the tour.",
      "Fernandes and Ugarte could start in midfield alongside each other for the first time this pre-season. United have seen the best and the worst of the latter this summer.",
      "Mbeumo deserves another start after making his bow in Atlanta against Everton. Cunha and Hojlund should complete the attack.",

      "With their season opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford now a little over a week away, here is the very latest on the injury front ahead of the clash with Fiorentina:",

      "Despite not being deemed fit enough to be involved during the tour, he did travel to the US almost a fortnight ago to continue his rehabilitation. He trained during his time in the States, and sources said he had been \"throwing himself around\" in training but in non-contact drills.",
      "Despite participating in team training this week, it is understood the visit of Fiorentina will come too soon for him to be involved. He is targeting a return against Arsenal.",
      "Possible return date: August 17 (Arsenal H).",
      "Injury: knock",
      "The Moroccan played no part in United's tour of the US due to a knock. He started the pre-season opener against Leeds in Stockholm last month and was taken off at half-time.",

      "He went to the US with the rest of the squad and participated in gym sessions. He was also photographed out on the grass before the tour came to an end.",

      "Possible return date: unknown.",

      "Manchester United have officially opened their new £50million first-team building at their Carrington training complex.",
      "The United squad spent more than a year in the recently-built £10m centre reserved for the women's and academy teams that opened in 2024.",
      "Architects from Foster + Partners had targeted an opening for the start of pre-season and for the the start of the new season, at the very latest.",
      "United have billed their new hub as \"a leading-edge, high-performance training environment designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence\".",
      "The project, overseen by architect Lord Norman Foster, has been completed within budget. The new building boasts updated equipment and technology, with a focus on fitness, nutrition, recovery and team unity.",
      "Players and staff provided input for the design, which has an emphasis on open work spaces and collaboration. Designers have also ensured there is greater exposure to natural light.",
      "United players moved into their remodelled quarters this week and the majority of the club's executive leadership team has also moved in. Several staff members have also relocated from Old Trafford.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe were present at Carrington for the ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday afternoon. United moved to Carrington from their storied training ground The Cliff in 2000, roughly midway through Ferguson's 26-and-a-half-year tenure as manager.",
      "Ferguson has since rued elements of the original design of Carrington, an area United first identified to relocate to back in 1996. Ferguson regretted that United's gymnasium was in a hall, rather than looking out onto the pitch.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo was scathing about the facilities at Carrington after he returned in 2021 and claimed the club \"stopped on a clock... Nothing changed, surprisingly. Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym.\"",
      "United made modifications after Ronaldo privately aired his qualms and a new canteen opened in 2022. The swimming pool was also upgraded but any other planned changes were halted by Ratcliffe.",
      "One of Ratcliffe's first major announcements after he invested a minority stake in United in December 2023 was to sanction a major revamp of Carrington.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “Following a review of the facility last year, we made a quick decision to invest significantly in the creation of a world-class performance environment for staff and players to reflect our ambition and vision for Manchester United.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been secured from RB Leipzig. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are already through the door. Ruben Amorim oversaw an encouraging pre-season in the United States. Carrington has received a £50milliom makeover and the facilities are now befitting of England's biggest club.",
      "There are plenty of reasons to feel positive as a Manchester United fan, just 76 days since a disastrous Premier League campaign concluded against Aston Villa at Old Trafford.",
      "United ended the season with a 2-0 victory against Villa, but the result did not matter because Tottenham Hotspur had lifted the Europa League in Bilbao just a few days earlier.",
      "An unlikeable team could not salvage a trophy from the worst season at the club in 51 years, which meant there would be no European football played at Old Trafford in 2025/2026.",
      "However, the mood is optimistic heading into the new campaign. Amorim has disposed of the 'bomb squad' and team morale has improved, which has been helped by the new signings.",
      "Amorim has overhauled his attacking line in a single window. Cunha and Mbeumo are already proven in the Premier League and look tailor-made to start in the No.10 roles, while Sesko will sprinkle a dash of unpredictability.",
      "Sesko clearly comes attached with risk, but he is undeniably an exciting addition and his explosiveness - he was a livewire at Euro 2024 - will help him adapt to the Premier League.",
      "The 22-year-old turned down another club to sign for United. Newcastle made a more lucrative offer but the player always preferred a move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have that in common: they turned down interest elsewhere because they were desperate to sign for United. Amorim wants the right personalities in his dressing room and has made a good start.",
      "There is also a clean slate at Carrington for the players after the USA tour. The £50m makeover was officially unveiled on Friday and Sir Alex Ferguson attended to unveil a plaque in tribute to the late Kath Phipps.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, and Jason Wilcox were also present, alongside Amorim, his coaching staff, and the first-team squad. Carrington is now a stunning facility and architectural firm Foster + Partners has delivered on their promise to create a world-class training environment.",
      "With input from staff and players, priority has been placed on functionality, openness, and connectivity, with increased natural light and open workspaces throughout the main building.",
      "Ratcliffe said: “Following a review of the facility last year, we made a quick decision to invest significantly in the creation of a world-class performance environment for staff and players to reflect our ambition and vision for Manchester United.",
      "\"We are delighted with the outcome and are confident the new facility will play an important role in building a winning culture at the club.”",
      "Berrada added: \"This project represents a clear step towards unifying every part of the club around a shared footballing vision. By bringing our staff and players closer together in one integrated environment, we are creating a culture of collaboration and high-performance.”",
      "In a previous interview, Berrarda said he has no doubt Carrington's refurbishment \"will positively impact the performance\" of the team. The makeover can only be a huge positive, and it adds to the positive feeling around the club.",
      "Everything points toward a positive Premier League campaign, and the only thing that can stop dampen the mood will be bad results.",
      "Only results will matter when the season gets under way. United simply cannot afford to start slowly because the pressure on Amorim's shoulders would increase.",
      "United have moved on from last season and it's firmly in their rear-view mirror. There are new players and a new training ground, but the memories from 2024/2025 will creep back in if United begin poorly.",
      "Arsenal will pose a huge challenge on the opening day of the season and Fulham away is another tricky fixture.",
      "Burnley is the final game in August before the Manchester derby in September. United will be hoping for at least six points from their opening three matches. Nine points would bring the positivity to an even higher level.",

      "Benjamin Sesko hid from photographers at Manchester Airport on Thursday night. There is no hiding place for a Manchester United striker.",
      "Never mind one who has cost £73.7million. Sesko is a strapping presence yet he may have to beef up his frame just to shoulder the burden of leading the line for United.",
      "Sesko was born in 2003, played in Austria and has been operating in one of Europe's top five leagues for budding Champions League qualifiers. Just like Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "So the minimum target for Sesko this season is 16 goals, the number Hojlund tallied in his respectable first campaign in England. Hojlun's overall numbers are cause to look away: 26 goals in 95 United appearances.",
      "Hojlund was always destined to fail. Switching to the same agency that represented Erik ten Hag marked his card with some teammates.",
      "One United player shook their head at the mention of Hojlund. Another lamented how few tackles he won, his lack of pressing and aerial sickness. A senior figure at the club questioned Hojlund's work rate.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot have all given him short shrift on the pitch. Players were genuinely reluctant to pass the ball to Hojlund in his first season amid reservations about his hold-up play.",
      "In pre-season alone, Hojlund has vented at Dalot over a purportedly delayed pass. In Atlanta, he kicked the post after Patrick Dorgu kicked at goal.",
      "It is ironic that John Murtough is now employed by Atalanta, having agreed an overall £72m deal with them to sign Hojlund in 2023. Since that transfer, Atalanta have won the Europa League, with Ademola Lookman scoring a hat-trick in the Dublin final against Bayer Leverkusen, and Mateo Retegui was the top scorer in Serie A last season.",
      "Hojlund mustered three goals in his last 35 United games. This is what United can do to a £70m-odd striker.",
      "\"I'm still very young,\" the 22-year-old Hojlund protested last week. \"I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals in the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",
      "What Hojlund was essentially saying was that not everyone is like Erling Haaland in their early 20s. Haaland, like Sesko, cut his teeth at Red Bull Salzburg before rejecting United to move to the Bundesliga.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me,\" Hojlund assured us in the Soldier Field mixed zone, \"it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Hojlund insisted \"my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens\". Some of those close to him think differently.",
      "Sesko is a different profile to Hojlund. He was more renowned as a teenager and United tried to sign him three years ago when he was 19. Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic.",
      "United valued Sesko at £15m. Salzburg wanted £30m. Three years later, United have paid more than double. His fee is just shy of the £75m United parted with for Romelu Lukaku, their last Premier League-proven striker signing, in 2017.",
      "After Sesko joined RB Leipzig, it was telling that United still opened the doors to Basanovic at Carrington and Old Trafford, rather than burn their bridges. Keeping the line of dialogue open led to Matt Hargreaves greeting Basanovic and Sesko on the Manchester Airport tarmac.",
      "Sesko will likely line up for United for the first time against a club that was tipped to sign him. Arsenal will instead have Viktor Gyokeres at the apex of their attack. United enquired about Gyokeres before they turned to Sesko.",
      "That is another reality Sesko will have to blank out. Gyokeres, Liam Delap and Ollie Watkins were all sounded out before him. £73.7m is a steep fee for a fourth-choice striker. Delap cost £30m, Gyokeres went for a fee rising to £64m. There is no way Watkins would have commanded as much as Sesko has.",
      "Leipzig finished seventh last season. The only scrutiny on the reviled Red Bull franchise in Germany centres around their manufactured origins. They are a franchise club, anathema to the traditions of Germany's historic clubs. United is the most scrutinised sporting institution on the planet.",
      "As if this all wasn't onerous enough for Sesko, there is something he almost certainly hasn't considered. In my lifetime, there have been two forwards United and Newcastle United have vied for: Alan Shearer in 1996 and Wayne Rooney in 2004.",
      "That's the highest goalscorer and the third-highest goalscorer in the Premier League era. 468 goals between them. The leading scorers of Newcastle and United. They are English football greats not of the past 33 years but its entire history.",
      "That Sesko is mentioned in the same breath as them seems incongruous but it is fair. If he is mentioned in the same breath as them again in a different context, he will have been as totemic a buy as Fernandes.",
      "There is no hiding place.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Manchester United are preparing for a hectic end to the summer transfer window. After getting Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the door earlier in the window, Ruben Amorim could still welcome three new players to his squad.",
      "Improvements to United's attack have been made with Cunha and Mbeumo adding 35 Premier League goals to a team that struggled in front of goal. Diego Leon has also arrived from Paraguay to become the latest wonderkid to be signed under Ineos.",
      "It's expected the Slovenia striker will be unveiled as Amorim's new centre-forward at Old Trafford on Saturday ahead of the pre-season friendly against Fiorentina. With three weeks until the window slams, United have two more positions to deal with.",
      "Another new goalkeeper has been touted since the window opened, but a replacement for Andre Onana currently seems unlikely to come in. The priority after Sesko is expected to be a new midfielder - with Brighton's ball-winning sensation Carlos Baleba on their radar.",
      "It's been reported that United have made contact with the Seagulls - via intermediaries - over the possibility of a move for the Cameroon international. Since signing from LOSC Lille, Baleba has attracted interest with his displays at the AMEX Stadium and United are huge admirers.",
      "However, it has been widely reported that Brighton value the midfielder at £100million, a figure close to the one they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023 - from Chelsea. It's clear United would have to construct a near-perfect financial package to reach an agreement.",
      "Despite Brighton's asking price, the latest figures released by the CIES Football Observatory indicate the midfielder should be valued between €75m (£65m) and €87m (£75.4m). Using a sample of over 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression, with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable.",
      "It's understood that Brighton don't want to sell Baleba - at least for another year - but that hasn't stopped them cashing in on other highly-rated players, such as Joao Pedro, Alexis Mac Allister and Pervis Estupinan, throughout the years.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United are aware that the Seagulls will be hard to negotiate with. However, it's still reckoned that Baleba would be ready to say yes to a move to Old Trafford this summer, even without the prospect of them playing in Europe.",

      "'Take me home, United road' is a pre-match staple at Old Trafford nowadays.",
      "And incoming signing Benjamin Sesko is poised to hear Manchester United fans belt it out for the very first time ahead of Saturday's pre-season finale against Fiorentina.",
      "The plan is for him to be unveiled to his new army of supporters ahead of the clash with the Italian side, similarly to the way Rasmus Hojlund was presented to the fans ahead of United's penultimate pre-season friendly of the summer against RC Lens two years ago.",
      "Like Hojlund, there is also a very high probability Sesko will make his United debut against Arsenal. Furthermore, they have also ended up at Old Trafford via spells in Austria.",
      "With the duo sharing a cluster of similarities, United supporters will just be hoping Sesko is more potent inside the penalty area. The Slovenian is on the cusp of joining the club from RB Leipzig in a deal that is going to cost £73.7million.",
      "He arrived in Manchester on Thursday evening and is now in the process of putting the finishing touches to the move. He will become United's fourth signing of the summer and their third new addition to the attacking department.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived from Wolves and Brentford on the back of highly successful seasons, scoring 17 and 20 goals respectively.",
      "Sesko is on the brink of joining the Reds on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany. Given he did not turn 22 until the very end of May, 21 goals in a season at the age of 21 marked a respectable haul.",
      "It marked the second time he had smashed his way through the 20-goal barrier in a single season in his senior career. He scored 13 times in the Bundesliga and chipped in with four goals apiece in the Champions League and DFB-Pokal.",
      "He previously went beyond the 20-goal barrier in 2020/21, also scoring 21 times, during a season-long loan spell at FC Liefering in the Austrian second division.",
      "In comparison, Hojlund has never scored 20 goals or more in a single season in his senior career. His best return in a single campaign is 16 - a landmark he reached in his first season at United and previously in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Hojlund's record in his first season at Old Trafford was very respectable. Considering he had joined United injured and immediately found himself at the top of the pecking order with no adequate support in his department, it was a promising maiden season at the club.",
      "However, he regressed last season, scoring just ten goals, of which only four of them were scored in the Premier League. United need to be able to rely on a striker who is capable of scoring 20 goals a season, and Hojlund does not look like being that player.",
      "With the exception of Erling Haaland, whose record can only be described as freakish, not many young strikers have arrived in the Premier League in recent seasons and immediately hit the ground running by scoring a lorry load of goals.",
      "There is no guarantee of Sesko, despite being compared with Haaland, following in the Norwegian's footsteps, but United will take confidence from the fact he has smashed his way through the 20-goal-a-season barrier - and so recently.",
      "At the age of 22, the weight of pressure on Sesko's shoulders will be unlike anything he has experienced before. Few positions in world football are scrutinised as much as the centre-forward position at United.",
      "Sesko built up a respectable record at Leipzig, scoring 39 goals in 87 games. His Bundesliga record stands at 27 goals in 64 games.",
      "Signing him for such an eye-watering fee, United will demand instant results from him. However, they will take comfort from the fact he will be playing alongside two attackers so well-versed in the Premier League - and that could make a world of difference.",
      "Hojlund, by contrast, did not have that luxury. He was brought in to be the main man with no support acts.",
      "The pair of them have taken similar routes to Old Trafford, and they could both make their debuts against the same opponent. United will just be hoping the end result is different.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "David De Gea is set to make his first return to Old Trafford since his Manchester United exit on Saturday.",
      "The 34-year-old left United in June 2023 - after 12 years with the club. During that time, De Gea made 545 appearances, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League among other honours.",
      "However, De Gea departed United following the expiration of his contract, leaving him as a free agent.",
      "United, meanwhile, replaced the Spain international with Andre Onana in a £47.5million deal from Inter Milan.",
      "There had been talk that De Gea could return straight to action and move to Saudi Arabia, but the ex-Atletico Madrid stopper instead spent a considerable amount of time out of the game. Indeed, De Gea did not sign for another club for more than 12 months - until August 2024 - when he made the move to Serie A side Fiorentina.",
      "De Gea made his debut in the Conference League against Puskas Akademia and went on to have a top debut season in Florence. In total, De Gea made 42 appearances, keeping 11 clean sheets and conceding just 50 goals.",
      "Now, De Gea, who signed a new three-year contract at Fiorentina back in May, is expected to make his return to United on Saturday when his side travel to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly.",
      "But exactly how does De Gea feel about United, two years since he left the club? Well, speaking last summer, the Spaniard had nothing but positive things to say about his former employers.",
      "In his press conference after signing for Fiorentina, in August 2024, De Gea said: \"United is a top, top club and my heart will always be there. I never thought about retiring, it was just difficult to find motivations for a new chapter after 12 years at a top club like Manchester United... and I finally felt that at Fiorentina.",
      "\"I spent a year in Manchester, before returning to Madrid. I wanted to stay at a high level. I didn't stop. It's not easy to train alone. I spent two years in Manchester, it's my home. That's where my heart is set.",
      "\"It was difficult for me to find motivation to evaluate offers, so I decided to take a sabbatical.",
      "\"I am fit, I trained every day, even more than before. I am on a good level. Perhaps it will take some time in the first games, but I've been playing for many years, so you just need to put me in goal.\"",
      "De Gea's Fiorentina have already played two matches on English soil this week. They lost 2-0 to EFL Championship side Leicester City last Sunday before being held to a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.",
      "As well as welcoming De Gea back, United will hold a presentation pre-match to honour De Gea's time at the club. Bruno Fernandes will lead the presentation - which will take place ahead of kick-off.",

      "Of those, only the latter has secured a move away after joining Barcelona on loan. Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV, but they did not exercise their option to make that move permanent.",

      "Manchester United have identified Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba as a potential target this summer.",
      "The Athletic reported this week that initial contact has already been made with the south coast club, though any potential arrival would, likely, depend on player departures - following United's summer spending spree. Marcus Rashford has already left the club to join Barcelona on loan, while talks over Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea are still ongoing - although the Argentina international has reportedly already agreed on personal terms.",
      "Meanwhile, Baleba, who has three years remaining on his Brighton contract, is quickly emerging as one of the most highly-rated players in his position and has attracted the attention of the United hierarchy.",
      "According to ESPN, Brighton will demand €120million (£104m) for Baleba this summer. United are also mooted to face competition from Manchester City for his signature.",
      "Elsewhere, talkSPORT has suggested that the Seagulls would be willing to cash in on the midfielder, but not until next summer.",
      "Brighton's hierarchy reportedly believe Baleba has the potential to be as valuable as Moises Caicedo, whom they sold to Chelsea. Caicedo completed the transfer to Stamford Bridge, for a British record fee of £115million, in 2023.",
      "Toby Collyer will not be included as a makeweight in any potential deal for Baleba. While reports have stated he could be used as a sweetener to facilitate a proposed transfer - given his background within Brighton's academy before departing in 2022 - United have no plans to involve him in the negotiations.",
      "Born in Worthing, just 10 miles from Brighton, Collyer appeared destined to break into the first-team at the Amex Stadium before being released by the club. His future remains uncertain this summer.",
      "The midfielder has attracted loan interest, and there is also said to be interest from clubs looking to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "Brighton's chief executive, Paul Barber, has played down speculation that United have been in contact over the possibility of signing Baleba.",
      "\"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players,\" Barber said. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",

      "Manchester United have been informed of how much it may cost to sign Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "News emerged on Thursday that Baleba has become a player of interest to United this summer as the transfer window rolls on. Baleba has been tentatively linked with a move away from the Seagulls for some time, with the latest update being the first time a potential move may actually be on the cards.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer and are also close to completing the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig. It remains to be seen if Baleba will move to Old Trafford, with United now being told how much a transfer may cost them.",
      "ESPN have reported that Brighton will demand €120million (£104million) for Baleba this summer. United will reportedly also face competition from Manchester City for Baleba's signature this summer.",
      "However, despite United having an interest in Baleba, it has been claimed that a move may be tough to complete financially once a deal for Sesko is over the line.",

      "Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr failed in their attempt to sign Bruno Fernandes this summer.",
      "Earlier in the transfer window, Fernandes' future at Manchester United was uncertain and his agent met with Al-Hilal officials in Saudi Arabia to discuss a lucrative move to the Kingdom.",
      "Saudi reports claimed Fernandes had been offered a multi-million pound financial package to move to Al-Hilal. However, there was no formal contact between the clubs and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",
      "It has now emerged that Al Nassr were also interested in signing Fernandes this summer.",
      "Al Nassr's manager, Jorge Jesus, has admitted he wanted to bring Fernandes to Saudi, but he was informed the midfielder had already committed to remaining in Manchester.",
      "“I wanted to,\" Jesus told Sport Informa when asked about signing Fernandes. \"But Bruno decided on staying. We had already spoken last year. This year I knew he had made the decision to continue with Amorim.\"",
      "In June, Fernandes touched on his desire to play at the highest level when he explained his decision to reject Al-Hilal. And former Benfica boss Jesus reacted: “He is in a league that they say is the best in the world, but I do not agree. For me, it is the Spanish league [La Liga].\"",
      "When Fernandes discussed his decision, he said: \"It was a very exciting offer. The president of Al Hilal was very nice to me. They talked to my agent, but I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what I wanted to do with my future. Never did she say yes or no, or offer to make the decision for me.",
      "\"She's always been behind me with every decision. It would have been easy to change, even from a family point of view, as Ruben Neves and João Cancelo are there [with Al-Hilal].",
      "\"Our kids are used to each other, I'm used to them, but I want to play at the highest possible level, playing in the major competitions and I know I still can. And I'm happy about my decision.\"",
      "The Portugal international won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a fourth time last term, joining David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players who have won it four times.",
      "Fernandes' contract runs until the summer of 2027, with the option of another year.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "",
      "10) Juventus – £102.54m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £122.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £133.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "6) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",

      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",

      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",

      "",
      "14) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",

      "With Spurs confirming the worst about James Maddison’s ACL injury and Thomas Frank offering a gloomy update on the fitness of Dejan Kulusevski after a 4-0 pre-season friendly defeat to Bayern Munich, it looks certain they will have to go back into the transfer market to do something about their moribund attacking options.",
      "Even the seemingly perfect – if emotional – end to Son Heung-min’s Tottenham career looks slightly different in the light of Maddison’s serious injury. The mischievous among you might well ask whether Spurs would even still have sanctioned his exit had the cat not been so entirely out of the bag before that game against Newcastle in Seoul.",
      "That’s a hypothetical, though, and what Spurs need is something real. Worth remembering they were pretty keen on signing Morgan Gibbs-White even before this Maddison setback. That ended… badly for Spurs. They could really do with at least one of these ending rather better over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "Nico Paz (Como)\nThere are conflicting reports about the seriousness and even existence of Spurs’ interest in the Como playmaker, but there would be something amiss if the 20-year-old wasn’t at least on their radar even before the last week’s unpleasantness.",
      "He would appear to have all the necessary tools for Spurs’ needs, but it’s a deeply difficult deal to do at a price Spurs are going to like with his former club Real Madrid entitled to 50 per cent of any fee and in keen and observant possession of a buy-back clause.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nPerhaps not the most exciting of the options within the Premier League but in some ways the most interesting. After the way Elliott starred for England U21s this summer we really are incredibly keen to see what he can do given a full season of proper first-choice, first-team responsibility and there’s a compelling case that Spurs would now be the most fascinating place for that to happen.",
      "There really isn’t another club right now that can offer the same mix of opportunity and big stage for Elliott to prove he can take his age-group dominance into senior football.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with being happy as a vital and useful squad member at this excellent Liverpool side, but it does feel like he could be so much more somewhere else.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Man City)\nIt seems like he’s going to be a key figure in the final weeks of the transfer window. It’s felt like everyone’s been playing a waiting game with Grealish this summer. We all know he’s going to leave City; the question is when and where to.",
      "We get the sense that he’s not yet ready to commit to the kind of teams that might have him at the top of their shopping list, and the teams he might be ready to commit to haven’t yet worked down their list of targets far enough to reach him.",
      "But the time where this game of chicken ends feels closer than ever after that Maddison injury. Even if it doesn’t kick Spurs into desperate action to find out whether the Aston Villa playmaker version of Grealish is still there lurking within the Guardiola automaton, it will surely make other interested parties get a wriggle on.",
      "We’re really not sure we want to see this one, purely because it would mean finding a new player to take second place on our list of the most Spurs player never to actually play for Spurs. Top spot is and always will be, of course, Stewart Downing’s.",
      "",
      "Ebere Eze (Crystal Palace)\nTottenham’s interest here is long-standing but Arsenal appear to have stolen a march on their local rivals this summer. But that deal remains undone and the chance for Spurs to make another move of their own is still there.",
      "Can they offer what Arsenal can? They cannot, but that cuts both ways. They can certainly offer him an easier route to unquestioned first-choice selection for 50-odd games in a World Cup year, for instance.",
      "As ever when talking about potential departures from Palace this summer, though, it is worth noting that they themselves are neither desperate nor particularly keen to sell any of their FA Cup-winning stars at this time. This will not be a cheap option.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nAnother high-class option where the interest is long-standing but the attentions of a London rival may render it moot. Chelsea have appeared Simons’ likeliest destination for most of the summer, and again the only real card Spurs have to play is in offering fewer existing players standing in his way.",
      "And that feels like it’s got more chance of counting for something with Eze than it does Simons. And we’re not sure it’s got that much chance with Eze.",

      "",
      "Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)\nRogers’ name popped up briefly in connection with Spurs earlier in the summer and there’s a good chance the boat has been missed here, with any deal far more likely before the PSR deadline than after it.",
      "He also limped out of Villa’s 4-0 friendly win over Roma on Wednesday night, raising doubts about his participation in the early weeks of the season. Something that might, counter-intuitively, not be the worst news for Villa in the long-term.",
      "They remain keen to tie him down to a new contract but are surely primed to expect at least a phone call from London. One that very likely also mentions the words ‘Jacob’ and ‘Ramsey’.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nReality bit for Mainoo in a difficult 24/25 season and there remain doubts about where he best fits into Ruben Amorim’s system at Manchester United. Is he physical enough for a role in the midfield double-pivot? Is he creative enough to be one of the two number 10s?",
      "After a summer full of talk suggesting he could be on the move, the tone has shifted. It now appears more likely he’ll remain at Old Trafford for now, but with United continuing to chuck all sorts of money at all sorts of players it does still feel like some will need recouping somewhere along the way; Mainoo could yet emerge as something of a spare part.",
      "Whether he’s exactly the sort of player Spurs need to take on such a significant creative burden in what currently looks like a team of honest plodders is less certain, but he does possess that Maddison-like ability to unlock a defence with a clever pass others might spot.",
      "",
      "Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)\nLook, at some point in this kind of list it is an absolute and irrefutable law that you must pose the question “Who has done this job for the manager elsewhere?”",
      "Damsgaard might not have got the same attention as your Bryan Mbeumos or Yoane Wissas at Brentford last season, but he was a key figure in their attacking efforts and reached double figures for assists.",
      "Frank obviously knows all about a player who started 34 Premier League games for the Bees last season – and came off the bench in all the other four – and he wouldn’t command the price tag of many others on this list. At 25, he’s also a potential long-term rather than stop-gap solution.",
      "But he has five years left on his contract and Brentford’s interest in losing another key figure this summer – and this late on – would, we suggest, be fairly low.",
      "",
      "Lucas Paqueta (West Ham)\nThe very idea of Spurs signing anyone from West Ham was a ludicrous one until as recently as this very summer, and we’ll cheerfully concede that when the first talk of Mohammed Kudus joining Tottenham emerged in June we immediately dismissed the idea and assumed the Hammers and/or Kudus’ camp were simply trying to smoke out interest from elsewhere.",

      "Now, the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season – looks imminent to round out the attack.",
      "Once that move is complete, though finances might make it a struggle, United could look to improve the midfield. Caught Offside reports attention could be turned there, with Como midfielder Nico Paz looking ideal to add both quality and creativity to the Red Devils.",
      "After Tottenham began contact for the transfer, the report suggests United and Chelsea ‘could be next’. They state there could be a battle between the three sides for ‘one of the hottest names in European football’.",
      "Paz, in his first season with Como, scored six goals and assisted nine more in 35 games, and had his former side Real Madrid looking at him for a while before they reportedly opted against bringing him back.",

      "Though United are said to be showing strong interest, it seems it would be difficult for them to pay a big sum, given they have already parted with around £130million this summer, and another £74million will leave their account for Sesko.",
      "Chelsea too have paid big money for a lot of players this season, but they have also registered big sales, such as Noni Madueke and Joao Felix.",
      "As such, they might well be able to finance a deal for Paz, beating their Premier League rivals to the Spaniard’s signature.",
      "The report does also suggest there is a chance Real could activate their buyback clause for Paz, which is said to be much lower than what Como currently value him at.",
      "It rises by €1million each year, but will only reach €10million (£8.6m) by 2027, according to reports, so while Real are said to have left the scene for now, they might well be back at any point if Como don’t sell Paz."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "United are moving to improve upon a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term. They have signed two quality Premier League attackers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, and are closing in on RB Leipzig star striker Benjamin Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Current United striker Rasmus Hojlund‘s future has been up in the air all summer, with United reported at times to be unsure whether to keep him or let him go after he struggled massively in front of goal last season.",
      "Transfer insider Romano has revealed that United have opted for something in the middle of those two options, as they have ‘definitively opened doors’ for his loan exit, but there’s a twist.",
      "Indeed, Romano suggests that Hojlund ‘insists on staying at United’.",
      "He states AC Milan are in contact with his agents to advance for the deal, with the Red Devils angling for a loan fee of €6million (£5.2m) as well as having Hojlund’s full salary covered.",
      "But there seems a chance the striker could refuse the move in order to prove himself at United. That would be hard, though, as opportunities are likely to be limited after last season’s four-goal Premier League return, and the presence of current striker Joshua Zirkzee and soon Sesko, too.",
      "United’s thoughts on Hojlund have changed recently, too, as Romano said of late: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "That differs from their current stance that the door is open for the striker to leave.",
      "Following on from that, it’s been suggested that Milan’s view is they’re ready to sign Hojlund, with United happy to see him go, but there’s been no green light from him, and it looks like it will stay that way.",
      "A new report has revealed when Rasmus Hojlund lost the support of Manchester United’s dressing room, while four concerns have come to light.",
      "Man Utd have ‘agreed a loan deal’ for Rasmus Hojlund with AC Milan in ‘pole position’ to get a deal over the line for the striker, according to reports.",

Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination. And we wouldn’t be surprised to see Chelsea enter the race now Levi Colwill is crocked.",

Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens.

At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",

But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should.

We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",

      "9) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made a week ago and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east.

This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be around £40million. RB Leipzig are keen.

      "Liverpool, Manchester United, Man City and Real Madrid have all incorporated recycled plastic into their kits but more needs to be done for sustainability.",
      "",
      "Football kits have morphed from humble cotton shirts into technological, fashion-driven apparel packed with synthetic fibres.",
      "But beneath the slick designs and vibrant club badges lies a hidden environmental cost.",
      "Most kits are made from polyester, a plastic derived from fossil fuels that is notorious for its carbon footprint, microplastic shedding and waste generation. Major brands such as Adidas, Nike and Puma have unveiled sustainability initiatives. Yet questions remain about whether these efforts meaningfully change the game or simply greenwash it.",
      "From microplastic pollution to soaring carbon emissions and textile waste, the synthetic nature of modern football kits is problematic. Washing polyester garments releases tiny plastic particles into waterways, entering the food chain.",
      "It is estimated that only about nine per cent of all plastic is ever recycled. Most persists in the environment for centuries, as microplastics break down into smaller and smaller particles. Recycling and reuse may not be an adequate solution.",
      "“Recycling is the mop,” Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana, a non-profit organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring the world’s oceans, told PBS. “We need to first turn off the faucet.”",
      "The carbon cost of virgin polyester is also high. Producing new polyester consumes significant energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, while the fast turnaround of kit releases – driven by fan demand, marketing and trends – adds to the mountain of textile waste. Simply recycling used kits doesn’t address this systemic overproduction.",
      "Brand initiatives tackle some of these issues. Adidas, for example, launched the Primeblue and Primegreen programmes in collaboration with Parley for the Oceans, using recycled ocean plastic in their performance fabrics. Primeblue contains Parley Ocean Plastic, while Primegreen contains no virgin plastic. These fabrics were designed to help Adidas meet their commitment to eliminate virgin polyester use by the end of last year and reduce their carbon footprint by 30 per cent by 2030.",
      "In 2024, Adidas reported that 99 per cent of all polyester used in their products was recycled, painting a picture of early achievement of their goals.",
      "Nike’s sustainability push is centred on their “Move to Zero” campaign, which aims to reduce carbon, waste and reliance on virgin materials. Nike has produced kits composed of recycled polyester made from plastic bottles, diverting vast amounts of waste from landfill. These garments featured prominently in Liverpool’s recent kits before their switch to Adidas, aligning brand efforts with the club’s own sustainability objectives.",
      "Similarly, Puma have introduced their RE:FIBRE initiative, which recycles textile waste into new performance garments and pledges to reach 75 per cent recycled polyester use by 2025 across their products, including football kits.",
      "These efforts have influenced club policies. As well as Liverpool’s Nike kit including recycled polyester derived from plastic bottles, Manchester City’s Puma kits use materials from the RE:FIBRE program, reflecting a circular-economy approach driven by their sponsor’s sustainability targets. These partnerships are seen as aligning manufacturers’ material choices with club branding and green credentials.",

      "Fan sentiment and market forces are playing their part, too. According to a study by Sport Positive Leagues, clubs that adopted kits made from recycled materials saw a significant uptick in positive feedback, indicating growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products.",
      "But the path forward is thorny. Using recycled polyester still means reliance on plastic. While Adidas and Puma reduce dependency on virgin polyester, the end-product is still synthetic fabric. Critics note that recycled polyester may not match the performance properties of virgin polymers precisely, though most advances in fabric engineering now close that gap. Brands may also overstate sustainability claims, with limited third-party certification or product lifecycle transparency.",
      "Industry observers stress that while recycled polyester reduces waste and carbon emissions compared to virgin polyester, it perpetuates a plastic-dependent model unless broader systemic change occurs. Performance trade-offs also remain a concern at the elite level – especially in high-wicking, breathable kits designed for extreme physical exertion. Fabric rebirth may necessitate compromises.",
      "Transparency is another hurdle. Brands release sustainability milestones, but independent verification is less common. Adidas’ claim of 96 per cent recycled polyester is laudable, yet independent auditors and lifecycle assessments are limited in public view. Consumers may not know how ocean plastic was collected, where recycling processes occurred or what happens at end-of-life for the garments themselves.",
      "Ultimately, sustainability in football fashion is caught at the intersection of ecology, economics and consumer culture. Big brands have undeniably propelled recycled materials into flagship football kits, driving clubs to align with sustainability narratives.",
      "Adidas’ Parley initiative brought recycled ocean plastic into jerseys worn by Manchester United and Real Madrid, signalling symbolic and practical change. Nike’s Move to Zero and Puma’s RE:FIBRE similarly reflect an industry-wide shift towards circularity.",
      "But critics like Savitz remind us that greenwashing is a real danger without meaningful reduction in plastic production.",
      "To truly reach sustainable fashion, football apparel must embrace more than recycled synthetics. The industry needs to rethink supply chains, invest in biodegradable fibres, reduce the frequency of kit releases and provide clear transparency – from raw materials to end-of-life disposal.",
      "Clubs can leverage sponsor influence to push for real change such as longer kit cycles, reuse initiatives, buy-back programmes and circular design. Consumer education is essential, too. Fans should understand that buying a recycled kit is better than virgin plastic, but it is not a solution in itself.",
      "Until then, sustainability remains a work in progress. Brands and clubs can score goals in raising awareness and shifting materials, but the environment’s full victory depends on ending plastic dependency – not merely recycling it.",

      "“You would be hard pushed to lose money at £30million because I think he is a player whose wages are manageable right now because he’s young and he’s not had that big uplift.",
      "“I think he would get a sizeable contract at Chelsea, but I think to the point where he’s the kind of player that if you bought him for £30million and he was okay, not disastrous, but you wanted to shift him on next summer or the summer after, it feels very doable to Europe.",
      "“I do think it’s a low-risk deal. But then, if it is so low risk, then it is interesting that so far nobody has bitten. There seems to be very little interest aside from Chelsea, which is slightly surprising.",
      "“You would have thought maybe he’s a deal that’s doable for quite a few clubs that are just under the main big teams. That sort of Europa League tier of teams maybe. I guess it’s limited numbers.",
      "“France is never going to be an option outside of PSG. I guess maybe Marseille, but very few teams now in France can do any sort of major business.",
      "“So, then you’re looking at Germany. Yes, there are two or three teams in Germany that could do this deal. In Italy, it’s a bit harder, maybe two or three again.",
      "“Then Spain, he really doesn’t seem to be interesting for Barca or Real, and he’s definitely doable for Atletico, but they seem not to have moved for him, which was once touted as being a potential option.",
      "“So, beyond that, then you’re looking at teams that maybe even at £30million, it’s a tough deal.”",
      "Chelsea have stepped up their interest in Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho after the Red Devils agreed a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko, according to reports.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly left it late to make a move in the hope they can get United to accept a lower fee.",

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed there are “two reasons” behind the delay on Chelsea’s move for RB Leipzig star Xavi Simons.",

      "Brighton and Hove Albion want £104million for Manchester United target Carlos Baleba, who is ‘happy to stay at the Amex’, according to a report.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest in Baleba first emerged on Wednesday night when David Ornstein reported (after Indy-f**king-Kaila) that contact had been made via intermediaries.",
      "Ornstein told The Athletic: “Brighton made clear they favour keeping hold of the Cameroon international — who is under contract until 2028 with an option to extend by 12 months — for at least another year.",
      "“There is also a recognition on all sides that a switch now may be unrealistic, especially if United seal their proposed move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.”",
      "F365 SAYS: Carlos Baleba, not Benjamin Sesko, will make Man Utd a passable football team",
      "United have so far completed the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon, and Enzo Kana-Biyik this summer, and are set to beat Newcastle United to the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After signing Sesko in a deal worth a total of £73.6m, Ruben Amorim’s side will be under pressure to offload players.",
      "Selling Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, and Antony has always been part of the plan — but after committing to such a big fee for the Slovenian striker, it’s now imperative.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Friday 8 August 2025 23:13, UK",
      "\"I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",
      "The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.",
      "It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.",
      "The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.",
      "United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.",
      "Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.",
      "\"It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.\"",
      "United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.",
      "Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?",
      "United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.",
      "From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.",
      "However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.",
      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."

      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",

      "\"We didn't want to finish in this way,\" The United skipper added. \"Our performance wasn't the best and we were a little bit lazy today.",
      "\"We want to avoid that because with laziness you can pay at any moment.\"",
      "The positives for United against Everton was a first appearance for Bryan Mbeumo, their £71m signing from Brentford.",
      "He combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha on a number of occasions during the first half, showing the benefit of new additions to the squad.",
      "However, the United skipper called for more reinforcements when asked if the club was where it needed to be heading into the new season.",
      "\"It's improving,\" he said. \"But it's not the place it needs to be.",
      "\"I don't want to take a dig at anyone but the club is doing the best they can in terms of the financial situation they talk about.",
      "\"But it was crystal clear we needed more competition for the players that were here, more quality to get everyone to step up a little more to get to the XI, and I think that is what the club are trying to do.",
      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "Asked about Fernandes's comments, manager Ruben Amorim told reporters: \"I think I'm happy for the players to have that feeling. It's saying that they understand the situation. So, it's a good feeling.",
      "\"One team can always improve with more players, but we have players to make that competition. We need to improve as a team and we have potential to improve with our players and I'm really happy with the squad.\"",
      "After a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last season and defeat in the final of the Europa League to Tottenham, Fernandes also called on United to start to show a winning mentality again, and he challenged the players to show it on the pitch.",
      "He said: \"Every small thing matters. At this football club you cannot do anything wrong on or off the pitch because it is too big worldwide and you get punished by that.",
      "\"You get the attention of the media, the attention from the fans and you have to be aware of that.",
      "\"The culture of this club was winning. We need to bring that back.",
      "\"It's not only the winning mentality that we need but it is other things too that the club are trying to improve like the facilities, the team, the staff and a lot of other things.",
      "\"A lot of people have suffered from this and now it is time for us players to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim says Man Utd are 'better' after their pre-season tour to the USA, but adds there is still work to do once they return to Carrington.",
      "He said: \"We already knew we had two weeks and it would not change in two weeks, but we are better. Even in this game [against Everton], we created chances and that is really important.",
      "\"I think the momentum of the tour was perfect. We had the weeks to work with a good environment, good feeling, and then we go back to Carrington and we are near to start the season.",
      "\"We are going with the feeling that we need to do a lot of things [better].\"",
      "Reflecting on Mbeumo's debut, Amorim added: \"He played well. He needs to understand the position, the movement but the first touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
      "\"You can see he's not in the perfect condition physically but he makes a lot of runs and that can stretch a team so everything I was expecting, he delivered.\"",
