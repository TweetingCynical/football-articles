      "Victor Osimhen has just five days to decide on a lucrative move to Al-Hilal in time for the Club World Cup - or wait for Manchester United. Osimhen, 26, is fresh off a surprise prolific loan spell with Galatasaray, helping the Istanbul giants win the league title by 11 points and lift the Turkish Cup.",
      "The Nigerian striker bagged 37 goals in 41 appearances but is due back at parent club Napoli, who plan to sell him to the highest bidder. Osimhen had a high-profile fallout with the club's hierarchy last season which led to his surprise move to Turkey.",
      "Napoli hope that a club matches his £63million release clause but Galatasaray are trying to sign him for less. The Super Lig champions could be blown out of the water, though, as Al-Hilal have turned their attention to Osimhen after being snubbed by United captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The Saudi side, who were keen on him last summer, want to make a big impression at the Club World Cup and have until June 10 to purchase new signings. They've agreed a £30m deal with AC Milan for left-back Theo Hernandez - who's yet to decide on the move - and have appointed Simone Inzaghi as their new manager fresh from his Champions League final humiliation with Inter on Saturday.",
      "According to German outlet Neunzigplus, Al-Hilal are willing to pay Osimhen a staggering £34m per year - nearly triple Galatasaray's £13m proposal. Al-Hilal are also willing to sell former Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic to free-up a starting place. But could Osimhen reject both and hold out for United?",
      "The Napoli outcast has been linked with the Red Devils amid their hunt for a new centre forward. United were targeting Ipswich's Liam Delap until Chelsea stole a march and announced his signing for £30m on Wednesday.",
      "Alongside Juventus, Chelsea were also tipped to sign Osimhen, so the stars could be aligning for the 26-year-old to end up at Old Trafford. But there's a sticking point.",
      "Having already shelled out £62.5m to sign Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha and being asked to pay £60m for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, United will be reliant on sales to make any further big-money signings. The Red Devils will listen to offers for their entire squad, although no departures are imminent.",
      "It's been suggested that United could use Rasmus Hojlund or Alejandro Garnacho as a makeweight in a deal for Osimhen, who's entered the final year of his contract with Napoli. There's nothing to say that the ex-Lille and Wolfsburg star couldn't join Al-Hilal after the Club World Cup, however, and Galatasaray would surely be willing to wait given his successful loan.",
      "Osimhen has been tight-lipped on his future, last addressing speculation in February. \"I don't know to be honest,\" the Nigeria international admitted.",
      "\"A few months ago, nobody ever thought I would come to Galatasaray, despite how big of a club they are. I live for the moment. [As] for what's going to happen in the summer, I don't know.",
      "\"But I want everyone to understand something: I really love this club so much. I love the fans, I love everyone associated with this club, from the president down to the coaching staff.\"",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "The United skipper has elected to stick with the Red Devils in what is little other than an outright declaration of loyalty.",
      "And United legend Keane, who heavily criticised Fernandes following a disappointing 3-0 defeat by Manchester City in 2023 - where he suggested then-boss Erik ten Hag should remove Fernandes from his role as captain due to a lack of leadership qualities - the latest revelation may well leave the pundit red-faced.",
      "\"When you're talking about where do they make changes - board level, managers - I'd start with that because the manager is capable of doing that. Fernandes is a brilliant footballer but he's the opposite to what you want in a captain.\"",
      "With Manchester United's underwhelming 2024/25 season now behind them, a lucrative offer may have tempted many to jump ship. However, Fernandes demonstrated his commitment by turning down the Saudi Pro League club's offer.",
      "Speaking on Tuesday, Fernandes admitted: \"There was an opportunity. The [Al-Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there. They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach [Rubem] Amorim. He asked me not to go.",
      "\"Manchester United didn't want to sell me. They don't need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.\"",
      "He added: \"It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team. We have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions and I feel capable of it.\"",
      "Amorim, who took over the reins from Ten Hag in November, is planning a major overhaul of his inherited squad after struggling to adapt the players to his unique system and style of play - and Fernandes is a key part of that.",
      "The Red Devils have already made moves in the summer transfer window, securing a £62.5million deal with Wolves for striker Matheus Cunha. The 26-year-old Brazilian joins after an impressive 15 goals in 33 Premier League appearances for Wolves and Cunha - preparing to play as one of the twin No.10s in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation - could be the answer to United's goal-scoring woes.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, the club's first-choice striker, has managed just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances this season, while last summer's big signing, Joshua Zirkzee, has netted only three times in the top-flight thus far.",
      "Alongside Cunha, United are pushing to secure the services of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. The 25-year-old, who scored 20 goals for the Bees this term, has made clear United are his No.1 choice this summer as he looks to move. United have seen a first offer - a package worth up to £55m for the forward, comprising an initial £45m plus £10m in add-ons - rejected but are set to return with a second offer shortly.",
      "Brentford value Mbeumo at £60million, and pointed to Cunha's price tag in initial negotiations. And as he is under contract until next summer with the option to extend for a year, the Bees aren't in any rush to sell the star if the price isn't right.",

      "Gary Neville has revealed what his first professional contract was at Manchester United, with the Sir Alex Ferguson handing every academy player the same deal. Neville joined United as an apprentice when he was 14, signing schoolboy terms with the promise of a professional deal when he turned 16.",
      "He ended up spending his entire professional career at Old Trafford, helping the club win eight Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues, three FA Cups and three League Cups. And Neville has now detailed the first contract he signed.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet, Neville said: \"At Manchester United, Sir Alex Ferguson gave us all the same [first professional] contract. It was all the same.",
      "\"He gave us a £4000 signing on fee, £210 a week year one, £230 a week year two, £250 a week year three, and £270 a week year four. We all got a Honda Prelude, and all got the same contract – there was eight of us.\"",
      "Neville has previously revealed that the first thing he bought after signing his deal was a house, with the defender putting down £16,000 as a deposit on a £160,000 property. \"Your own house is the best investment [you could make],\" he said.",
      "\"To be fair when you think about the fact it's getting harder for anyone to be able to afford a house in the country - which is a different conversation to have - but if you can own your own house, then what a start that is in life.",
      "\"When I got money with my first contract at [Manchester] United, I bought a house. That was a massive thing – it was a house which cost £160,000 and I put down £16,000 as a deposit, and at the time I was taking a big risk.\"",
      "Neville now owns his own property business which he set up with former United trainee Paul Devine during his playing career. And Neville revealed earlier this year that he had to run the business \"under the radar\" in order to avoid Ferguson's wrath.",
      "\"For 10 to 12 years, I had this almost like double life,\" Neville told the Daily Mail back in February. \"I did it under the radar, purely because I knew that it would be deemed as a distraction. Under Sir Alex, distraction was absolutely illegal, you know that.",
      "\"But I knew that my football career would come to an end, and I knew that I had to plan for it, I knew that I had to do something different and I loved it. The meetings, the thrill of the interior design, the selling part of it, the finding the land, the planning.",

      "Roy Keane has opened up about a bar fight he had with \"a hockey team\" while he was at Nottingham Forest. The Irishman was a fiery and destructive player during his time with Forest, Manchester United and Celtic.",
      "Whether it was steaming into tackles or taking on the likes of Patrick Vieira in the tunnel, Keane's temper was as famous as his brilliant abilities on the pitch. However, his heated nature was not solely confined to the field, as it often overflowed while he was out and about.",
      "Keane, 53, was reminiscing about his early days as a young player while speaking to his ex-Forest team-mate Mark Crossley. While they were talking about some of their nights out during their days playing under Brian Clough, the Irishman mentioned a fight he was in the middle of during a mid-season tour in Jersey.",
      "It was previously reported by FourFourTwo that Keane had been in the bar of their hotel at the time when a conversation with a female member of the public escalated and ended with her throwing a gin and tonic over him. He's alleged to have responded with a pint of ale, at which point the woman's husband got involved.",
      "The incident was brought up in conversation on the Stick to Football podcast, while the likes of Gary Neville, Ian Wright, Jill Scott and Wayne Rooney were listening. The conversation began with Neville asking the pair if they'd had any memorable nights out with each other.",
      "Crossley then turned to Keane and said: \"Do you remember the Jersey ones, they were good, weren’t they? Those mid-season ones.\" Keane immediately piqued the table's interest when he replied: \"I was sent back from that, remember?",
      "\"I had a fight with that hockey team or something.\" After Scott curiously asked if the ex-midfielder had taken on the entire hockey team, Keane wryly replied: \"It was a few of them.\"",
      "Keane would go on to elaborate on what happened in the bar fight after a mild cross-examination from the rest of the table. He began by explaining the consequences, saying: \"He (Clough) sent me back from Jersey. An incident in the bar.”",
      "When asked what happened by Crossley, Keane replied: \"[Someone] wanted to get something signed. [Then] someone threw a drink over me.”",
      "After Scott enquired whether it was because the Irishman refused to sign something, he replied: \"No, it’s because I had already signed something from him and I said, 'How many do you need?’ Then they threw a drink over me.”",
      "Explaining what happened next, Keane, with a wry smile, replied: \"I said that’s unacceptable behaviour. The next day he sent me back on a flight, two days early. The good days, huh?\"",
      "It would not be the last time Keane found himself having fisticuffs after sinking a few drinks. Last December, in a previous episode of Stick to Football, Keane explained how he left his ex-team-mate and former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel with a huge black eye after they came to blows while on a pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "Looking back on the incident, he said: \"Yes - he started it! It was self-defence, but yeah it was a proper fight. There was obviously drink involved and a bit of jetlag. I think Peter had a black eye. But we trained as normal the next day.\"",

      "Despite helping Chelsea win the UEFA Conference League during his temporary stint, he only started 19 Premier League games and was not a regular starter under Blues boss Enzo Maresca.",
      "Regardless of that, it was reported that the club were in talks to extend his stay in London but failed to agree personal terms with the winger.",
      "This led to the club paying a £5m penalty to Manchester United to avoid their obligation to sign him on a permanent deal for £25m.",
      "Sancho has just one year remaining on the five-year contract he signed when he joined United in 2021 for £73m, and is set to return to Old Trafford and is likely to be on the move again, with the star not in the plans of boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The future of the 25-year-old remains uncertain, but talkSPORT pundit Murphy believes Chelsea should have clinched a deal to keep the winger.",
      "Alongside Jim White and Simon Jordan on talkSPORT, the trio discussed Sancho's future with the former Crystal Palace owner criticised the winger for failing to perform consistently since his move to Manchester.",
      "He also implied that Sancho is more concerned about remaining a high earner instead of reviving his international career, given he hasn't been in an England shirt since 2021.",
      "\"I'd like to think people evolve, young players especially, you have to give them time to make mistakes,\" Murphy said in response to Jordan's criticism. \"But I actually think he's done alright for Chelsea this season when I've seen him.",
      "\"His technical ability is brilliant. [He] very rarely gives the ball away, now end product is a question mark. He's played in a lot of big games, and that's because he's reliable with the ball and he knows his job.\"",

      "\"He turned up at Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, when he was 20 and because they paid a huge amount for him which was inflated, he was expected to hit [the ground running]. I think Jadon Sancho for £25million is really good value.\"",
      "Upon the announcement of his departure from the Blues, Sancho expressed gratitude towards everyone at Chelsea on social media, posting on Instagram: \"Grateful for the experience.",

The Portuguese head coach is now demonstrating the same ruthlessness at Manchester United by sticking to his guns and selling any player that doesn’t fully buy into his philosophy.",
      "Amorim came into the Sporting role as a fresh-faced and inexperienced manager in March 2020. But he had a plan from the off, which was to establish his own style of play with his own players. That, in turn, sparked a mass clear-out in his first transfer window at the helm.",
      "The tactician sold a whopping seven players in his first summer, with three more leaving on free transfers and 15 being loaned out. It didn’t matter who they were - if they didn’t meet his requirements, they were axed.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been told that he has got the Saudi Pro League all wrong after declaring that he rejected a move to the Middle East because he wants to keep playing at an elite level.",
      "That's the verdict of Ivan Toney, who was asked about Fernandes' decision to stay at Manchester United. Toney, 29, moved to Saudi Arabia last summer to join Al-Ahli from Brentford in a transfer deal worth £40million despite interest from other clubs in the Premier League.",
      "After plundering 30 goals in 44 games for Al-Ahli, Toney was handed a surprise recall to the England squad by Thomas Tuchel ahead of the upcoming games against Andorra and Senegal.",
      "And the former Bees striker has questioned whether Fernandes has even 'seen the league' after being asked about the Portugal star's comments on the move.",
      "“That’s his decision. He maybe thinks it's different to me,” Toney said during an interview with talkSPORT while discussing Fernandes' decision to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "“He obviously hasn't seen the league. The standard is high. I always say this, people always judge it on not seeing it, you know? And you have to see it first hand to have your own opinion. If people went there and went to some games, they'd soon realise.",

      "“It was a very ambitious proposal,\" Fernandes said during a press conference ahead of Portugal's meeting with Germany. “The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",

      "Manchester United have appointed Jason Wilcox as their new sporting director after it emerged that Sir Dave Brailsford would be stepping back from his duties. The Red Devils had been without a sporting director since announcing the shock departure of Dan Ashworth in November.",
      "United had spent half a year chasing the ex-Newcastle chief's signature before co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe axed him after just five months, citing a lack of 'chemistry' and costing the club, who've made hundreds of staff redundant this year, a huge £4million in compensation. Wilcox, 53, was poached from Southampton and arrived as technical director two months before Ashworth.",
      "But now the former Manchester City academy head has been give a new position, one with increased seniority, after impressing Ratcliffe and senior Old Trafford figures, the Athletic report. Wilcox's promotion coincides with Brailsford's decision to step back.",
      "The ex-British cycling chief is the director of sport for INEOS, Ratcliffe's petrochemical conglomerate. Brailsford has been a consistent presence since Ratcliffe purchased his initial stake in the club which has now increased to 28.94 per cent.",
      "It's one of several changes to United's hierarchy during Ratcliffe's 18-month tenure. In April, INEOS chief Jean-Claude Blanc stepped down from his position as a director of the club.",
      "A regular at matches home and away, Brailsford was involved in the appointments of chief executive Omar Berrada and head coach Ruben Amorim. The 61-year-old carried out an audit of United's football operations and was across the £50m refurbishment of their training ground, Carrington.",
      "Brailsford even stepped down as INEOS Grenadiers' team principal to focus on the footballing project. But he'd become less visible in recent weeks, choosing to spend more time in Monaco after becoming a father last year, and will have less of a presence going forward.",
      "Brailsford will remain on United's football club board alongside legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson and former chief executive David Gill. Ratcliffe reportedly wants him to mentor cyclist Geraint Thomas, who's expected to be given a senior management position within the Grenadiers once he retires as a rider at the end of this season.",
      "Brailsford can also focus on INEOS' other sporting ventures. He was once influential at French side Nice but United's failure to qualify for European football means that he can work closely with them again. UEFA's ownership rules prevented INEOS from being as hands-on as Nice qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Will INEOS bring success back to Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Wilcox, meanwhile, will hope to enhance his growing reputation at Old Trafford. \"Jason, for me, is a guy at the coal face,\" Ratcliffe told the Times earlier this year. \"He ran the academy at Manchester City. Txiki Begiristain, I know, thought Jason had the best eyes in the club.",
      "\"Jason knows what'S working, what'S not working in terms of how Ruben's playing, his system, which players he's picking, which players we are going to buy in the future. And Jason's got views on all of those things. And when I listen to Jason speak, I get what he'S saying.\""

      "\"Why can't we make him a top player? If he's one of ours and he's shown talent. I don't know what's gone on there in the last few months. He's obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I'd like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro as his partner and it's probably not [Manuel] Ugarte as his partner, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I'm being honest. But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he's come through the ranks.",

Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, [Alejandro] Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",

      "They had 17 points from 16 games and were a point above the relegation zone. Carrick’s impact and influence would see Middlesbrough finish fourth that season before losing to Coventry City in the play-offs.",
      "Ok, that was two years ago but it was a remarkable spell of management. The ‘decline’ into eighth position in the 2023-24 season and into tenth last season has cost Carrick his job, even though Gibson had given him a new three-year contract last summer.",
      "The stark truth is that tenth place was a disappointment. There were mitigating circumstances, not least the injury to on-loan Liverpool winger Ben Doak and the sale of top scorer Emmanuel Latte Lath in the winter window.",

      "As a player, Carrick’s tally of 34 England caps was under-representative of his talent but he is exactly the sort of English coach who the Football Association should be monitoring.",
      "For now, though, he will surely want to get back into club management pretty quickly and while Levy and Tottenham Hotspur are unlikely to come knocking any time soon, someone is going to get a very good coach … and one with a point to prove.",

      "Manchester United have been told to forget trying to sign Bryan Mbeumo on the cheap – with Brentford wanting upwards of £60million for the forward. United have targeted Cameroon star Mbeumo as their second summer signing, having already recruited Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m after triggering his release clause.",
      "But Brentford are understood to value Mbeumo as the same value as Cunha and are not prepared to accept anything less than a similar price if they are to let him leave this summer. Brentford are also said to be willing to hold out until deadline day on September 1 if that is what it takes for United to meet their asking price for 25-year-old Mbeumo.",
      "The Bees are under no pressure to sell Mbeumo, with the club holding an option to exercise an extra year on his current deal, which still has one season left to run. Against that backdrop, they are relaxed about Mbeumo's situation, with the pressure on United to meet their valuation if they are serious about wanting the player.",
      "United are facing additional pressure in their pursuit of Mbeumo, with his Brentford team-mate and fellow forward Yoane Wissa, 28, the subject of interest from Saudi Pro League clubs.",
      "Brentford are unwilling to lose both Mbeumo and Wissa this summer, which means if the latter does secure a big-money move to a Saudi club, United face losing out on the former if they leave it too late.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is convinced Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals and provided eight assists last season for Brentford, would be an ideal fit for his 3-4-3 system.",
      "Amorim sees Cunha and Mbeumo operating either side of a striker, with skipper Bruno Fernandes – who is committed to United after turning down a move to Saudi – operating in a deeper role.",
      "Mbeumo's versatility is one of the reasons Amorim is so keen to sign him, with the forward able to operate in a variety of roles across the front line, including on the right and up front.",
      "His pace, with and without the ball, allied to his ability to create and finish chances clinically, are qualities United are crying out for, with the burden having fallen squarely on Fernandes last season.",

      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane scoffed at Thierry Henry's claim that former Arsenal and Chelsea man Ashley Cole is the best left-back he has seen. Henry insisted that the ex-England defender doesn't get the credit he deserves on the back of his unceremonious move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Hale End graduate Cole began his Gunners career in 1999 when he made his full debut, and would go on to establish himself under Arsene Wenger as one of the Premier League's finest full-backs. The Englishman won two league titles in north London as well as three FA Cup trophies, and was pivotal in the club's famous 2003/04 Invincibles campaign.",
      "While Cole, who played over 200 times for Arsenal, saw his Gunners legacy somewhat tarnished in 2006 when he joined bitter rivals Chelsea in an acrimonious switch, Henry believes he still doesn't get the recognition he deserves as one of English football's finest ever left-backs. Though Red Devils legend Keane slightly disagrees.",
      "\"There is a guy that I want to talk about, who I don't understand why in this country he doesn't get his respect: Ashley Cole,\" Henry stated on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Ashley Cole was outstanding.",
      "\"Firstly, in 2000, Ashley went to Crystal Palace on loan, and he saved them from relegation, playing as a winger. When you have a left-back that can dribble past their winger, he was the one who created space for the rest of the team at Arsenal. He started everything.",
      "\"For me, Ashley Cole is the best left-back I have ever seen. Me. I'm not talking about everybody. Ashley Cole… Going forward, defending, the desire, what he won and why he won it.\"",
      "While Henry sang the praises of his former team-mate, who he played alongside a staggering 195 times in the red of Arsenal, Keane then chimed in. \"I think he was a brilliant player, but when you talk about great left-backs, he doesn't spring to my mind,\" quipped Keane. \"Of course, he was a brilliant player.\"",
      "Henry rebuked Keane's claim and went on to discuss Cole's controversial and bad-blooded move from the north of London to the west, explaining he feels it is why the left-back isn't quite held in the regard he deserves. He continued: \"Ashley Cole is an Arsenal man.",
      "\"His whole family supports Arsenal. But I can understand why he left at the time. In 2005, David Dein shook hands on a deal, but he came back with something else.",
      "\"With Ashley moving to Chelsea, people don't give him the respect he deserves for everything that he has done. But for me, Cole was outstanding.\"",
      "Former Arsenal vice-chairman Dein oversaw plenty of successes during his 24 years in the role, but he previously admitted that letting the left-back leave was one of his biggest regrets before stepping down in 2007.",
      "Cole was offered a hefty pay rise by Stamford Bridge chiefs and he went on to enjoy a fruitful eight-year spell with the club, winning one league title, a Champions League, Europa League, League Cup, Community Shield and four FA Cups. He's considered very much in the debate of the greatest left-backs of all time alongside the likes of Roberto Carlos, Marcelo and Paolo Maldini.",

      "The 19-year-old is yet to appear for the United senior side but was included in Ruben Amorim's squad for their post-season tour of Asia, coming on as a substitute in both games against Asean All Stars and Hong Kong.",
      "Kone was introduced in the 32nd minute for Casemiro in the 1-0 loss to Asean All Stars before being hooked again for Toby Collyer at half time. Amorim used a similar tactic against Hong Kong to stagger his game time, bringing him on in the 27th minute before subbing him again at the interval, with Manuel Ugarte replacing him.",

      "The report claims the club have placed Kone on their list of players who are available for loan ahead of the 2025-26 season, after initially taking his first steps at United in the Under-21 side.",
      "He played nine times in the Premier League 2 for United's youth team, scoring once. His Under-21 coach Travis Binnion recently commented on his progress, admitting he struggled for fitness at first but is now at the level where he can play a string of games each week.",
      "Binnion admitted Kone still had \"a long way to go\" before he was ready for first team action under Amorim but remained upbeat over his future prospects.",
      "\"We have a long way to go,\" he told MEN in April. \"He broke down at Huddersfield, whereas now he can get through three games in a week. At the next level, first-team level, he wouldn’t be able to because he’s not quite there yet, but his decision-making will make that easier for him physically.",
      "\"If he’s not in the right position or he makes the wrong decision, the game then opens up and it’s harder to be consistently in the right positions. It’s a long-term project with him, but his ability is there for all to see.",
      "\"I think the position he plays in on the pitch requires a lot of discipline, and we’re working on that discipline and decision-making. He is a really good player, but you can see tonight he’s had three, four or five shots and it’s like, there aren’t too many No.6s who are getting into the areas he is.",
      "\"You don’t want to stifle that completely, but if he’s not in the right area of the pitch, then it’s harder for the team to function and it’s harder for him to develop, so he’s working really hard through training and language support.\"",

      "Brailsford will remain a director at the club but will return to his primary role as INEOS' director of sport. While that position means he remains a key link in the chain between United and INEOS, he is stepping back from a more hands-on role at Old Trafford.",
      "That decision is a result of Sir Jim Ratcliffe settling on a structure to run operations at United. Putting that group together had been Brailsford's primary responsibility, which is why the British cycling chief is now returning to his INEOS role.",
      "The 61-year-old has been a visible presence at the club since Ratcliffe's investment in United was confirmed in December 2023. He has been a regular at games, both at Old Trafford and away from home, and has worked out of Carrington while INEOS got their feet under the table.",
      "Brailsford spoke to staff members and players early on to gauge the mood at United and what needed to change. He was hands-on in key decisions around Erik ten Hag's future, the appointment of Ruben Amorim, and a £50million investment in the training ground.",
      "The move to relinquish his day-to-day involvement comes after Wilcox's promotion from technical director to director of football. This effectively sees him replace Dan Ashworth, who was dismissed as director of football in December 2024 after only five months in the job.",

      "There are a few common threads running through Manchester United's transfer activity in the early weeks of this summer. The club is looking to sign two Premier League-proven attackers who can bring pace, power, and athleticism to the team.",
      "But maybe the most obvious link between moves for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo is that both players will bring versatility to Old Trafford. Although both are forwards, they can play a few different roles in Ruben Amorim's system and offer flexibility.",
      "Let's start with Cunha, who has signed a five-year deal to complete a £62.5million move from Wolves. During his time at Molineux, he made 41 appearances as a centre-forward and 37 as an attacking midfielder. He looks an ideal fit for a No. 10 in Amorim's system, having played the same role under Vitor Pereira at Wolves, but he can also lead the line.",
      "He has done that at other clubs. The vast majority of his appearances for Atletico Madrid and RB Leipzig came as a striker, with a shorter spell at Hertha Berlin seeing him operate primarily as a left-winger, with a split of games as a striker and attacking midfielder as well.",
      "Mbeumo fits the same profile. He has just scored 20 goals in the Premier League from the right wing, but he isn't fixed to that position. His career with the Bees has seen him mostly play on the right, but he has also made 32 appearances as the No. 9 and 32 more as an attacking midfielder.",
      "There is a school of thought that Cunha and Mbeumo, who could cost around £120million as a pair, will be United's No. 10s next season, but it could also be that they fit into a more fluid and interchangeable attack.",
      "Having missed out on Liam Delap, United are still pursuing a move for a striker, but Cunha or Mbeumo could play there. Mbeumo could also potentially play as an attacking right wing-back in games where United dominate. He has the work rate and physicality to do it.",
      "There had been fears United would sign players to fit Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, potentially leaving themselves vulnerable if things don't work out for the head coach, who has had a difficult start to his Old Trafford tenure.",
      "But Amorim is keen to have players who can fit into different roles, and in March, chief executive Omar Berrada backed that vision and explained the players signed would be flexible enough to work in any system.",
      "\"I think it's riskier if you have a coach that doesn't have a clear idea of how he wants to play,\" said Berrada. \"And with Ruben, we don't see that risk.",
      "\"And when it comes to our recruitment strategy, without commenting too much, the idea we have is to be able to bring in versatile players that can be adaptable to multiple systems.",
      "\"And ultimately Ruben himself has said it, it's not about the 3-4-3 tactical formation, it's about an idea, a concept of how he wants to see the team playing. He wants to see the team playing more on the front foot, more of a possession, attacking-based style of football.",
      "\"So for that, you need players that can play in multiple positions that can adapt to that vision that Ruben has. And this is what we're going to try to do over the next years in our recruitment.\"",
      "Amorim has touched on having versatility a few times since his appointment last November. He has named Bruno Fernandes and Amad as two players who can fill different roles, with Fernandes comfortable as a holding midfielder or a No. 10, and Amad excelling at right wing-back and attacking midfield.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui is another who has shown versatility, having played in the centre of defence and wing-back, which is something Luke Shaw can also do.",
      "There is likely to be plenty more movement at Old Trafford before the end of this transfer window, and they could yet sign a fixed No. 9, but the addition of Cunha and pursuit of Mbeumo show the focus is on players who can operate in \"multiple positions,\" as Berrada put it three months ago."

      "Fernandes increasingly played in the deeper midfield role as the season progressed, and there are doubts about whether a partnership with Ugarte is solid enough to move up the table.",
      "There have been some good displays from Ugarte, sometimes alongside Fernandes in the pivot, but Amorim will be unsure whether they are a good enough midfield pairing for next season.",
      "If Fernandes had decided to join Al-Hilal, a new midfielder would have been brought in this summer to play alongside Ugarte, but it now feels like Ugarte will be the player facing the axe from the starting XI.",
      "To make Fernandes work in the No.8 role, a higher-quality midfield partner will be required, and it's disappointing that United might already need to sign a player of that ilk after splashing £42.3m on Ugarte.",
      "There is also the question of where Kobbie Mainoo fits in Amorim's plans next season. Does he play in deeper midfield? Cunha and Mbeumo should be the first choice in the No.10 roles.",

      "As starts to a summer transfer window go, Manchester United have made a solid one.",
      "United wasted no time in securing their first signing of the window, announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves just 14 hours after the window had opened on Sunday, following their decision to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "The Reds are determined to strengthen their attacking options this summer and now have their sights set on signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo. The attacker is understood to be keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "With that in mind, what business should United be striving to oversee this summer? MEN Sport has had a close look:",
      "Outgoings will be key to United head coach Ruben Amorim securing the incomings he both wants and needs. United's failure to qualify for next season's Champions League means their budget is not as big as it might have been, making sales all the more important.",
      "However, the Reds could find the task of shifting Sancho that little bit more challenging now that Chelsea have pulled out of the obligation to sign him on a permanent basis. They have paid a £5m penalty fee.",
      "Fellow attacker Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed by Amorim that he can leave the club for the right price. United now operate with a winger-less system, meaning the Argentine is no longer able to play his natural game at Old Trafford.",
      "The same, too, can be said of Rashford, Sancho and Antony. It is no secret that United are open to offers for every member of their squad this summer, but they are, of course, actively to offload some more than others.",
      "After a regressive second season at Old Trafford, United chiefs have lost patience with Rasmus Hojlund and he could be sold. The Danish striker is attracting interest from Inter Milan and other Italian clubs.",
      "He scored just four Premier League goals this season and is simply not good enough to be spearheading United's attack. He scored ten goals across all competitions this term.",
      "United should also be looking to cash-in on Casemiro. Despite producing an improved set of performances this calendar year, the Brazilian is close to entering the final year of his contract and will turn 34 in February. United will need to bank around £15m for him to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules [PSR].",
      "Furthermore, United should also be attempting to offload defenders Luke Shaw and Tyrell Malacia. The former has struggled to stay fit over the course of the last two seasons and Malacia was sent out on loan to PSV Eindhoven for the second half of the season.",
      "Finding a buyer for Shaw, however, a task for United that is easier said than done. His injury record has lowered his valuation and suitors will be mindful of his history on the injury front.",
      "Meanwhile, United should also be trying to sell goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. He has failed to live up to expectations when he has deputised for Andre Onana and he will almost certainly be keen to try and secure first-team football for next season ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "Despite already getting Cunha through the door, United plan for further additions in attack. As already documented, they are keen on signing Mbeumo to strengthen the right-sided No.10 position, and they also need a striker.",
      "The addition of a centre-forward has never been as crucial at Old Trafford. United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and need to reduce the risk of that happening again by landing a new No.9.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, United are yet to decide in which direction their striker search will head in. They are being linked with several big-name No.9s, including Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Napoli want to offload Osimhen this summer, making him an attainable option, but raising funds via player sales will be key to United's chances of signing the Nigerian international. He would be the perfect addition to United's attack after scoring 85 goals over the last three seasons.",
      "At the other end of the pitch, United also want to recruit a goalkeeper this summer to rival Onana for the No.1 spot. They need an upgrade on Bayindir and Amorim wants someone who can regularly compete with and challenge Onana.",
      "Should United sign Mbeumo, the likelihood is Amad will operate from right wing-back, meaning he will compete with Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui for that particular starting berth. That means there could be greater value in trying to sign a left wing-back to challenge and compete with Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The addition of a midfielder also has to be a top priority for United. Manuel Ugarte experienced an up and down first season at the club, meaning there is value in trying to find an upgrade on him.",
      "Goalkeepers: Andre Onana, Tom Heaton (if he signs a new contract) and a new goalkeeper.",
      "Centre-backs: Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven & Tyler Fredricson.",
      "Wing-backs: Noussair Mazraoui, Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Harry Amass, Amad & a new left wing-back.",
      "Midfielders: Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes & a new midfielder.",
      "Attackers: Joshua Zirkzee, Matheus Cunha, Chido Obi, Bryan Mbeumo & Victor Osimhen.",
      "*Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen will automatically leave the club when their contracts expire on June 30."

      "United snapped up the 18-year-old in January, spending just over £1million to sign him from Arsenal and a defensive injury crisis led to him getting more first-team opportunities than expected in the second half of the season.",
      "Heaven made an impressive debut as a substitute for extra-time against Fulham in the FA Cup and shone in a 45-minute outing against Arsenal, before starts against Real Sociedad and Leicester City, only for the youngster to then suffer an injury against the Foxes that kept him out until the final weeks of the season.",
      "But his impressive early displays mean he will be a member of the first-team squad next season and Heaven has revealed why Amorim felt he was an ideal for for his three-man defence.",
      "\"He just said our play style will suit me, because they play three at the back and I play on the left of the three so that allows me to run with the ball,\" Amorim told the United website. \"That's one of my strengths and defending out wide is one of my strengths as well.\"",
      "United's faith in youth was also one of the reasons Heaven was ready to swap the Emirates for Old Trafford mid-season.",
      "“The opportunities that the young players have got here in the past,” he said. \"I think United had the most minutes given to teenagers last season [2023/24]. That convinced me to come here.",
      "“And the people and the fans here are quite loving, and I felt that when I was playing. They’re so supportive.”",
      "Heaven joined the squad during the January transfer window and has revealed the role Mason Mount played in welcoming him to Carrington, recalling an early clash between the pair in a pre-season friendly in the United States, when Heaven was playing for Arsenal.",
      "\"The first day I was here at Carrington he [Mount] came up to me and introduced himself and we had a good 10-minute conversation,\" he said.",
      "\"He reminded me that we played each other in pre-season, and he remembered the tackle I hit him with in like the first minute. So yeah, me and Mason are good friends and obviously Bruno as well, the captain, he's helped [me settle]. Patrick [Dorgu] as well, we signed around the same week and we've been together since then.\"",
      "Heaven felt he was playing well before suffering the injury against Leicester which halted his progress, and he was praised by Wayne Rooney after his performance in the 4-1 win against Real Sociedad.",
      "“It’s a huge football club and at this time now, when maybe it’s not going right, to come in and play at 18 – it’s a lot of pressure, because those expectations are on you from the first minute,” said Rooney. “But I think from the games he’s played he’s been fantastic.",
      "“I came in as an 18-year-old at United and you do feel that pressure, but to come in as a centre-back - which is obviously a position where you can’t afford to make mistakes, otherwise you get punished – is very difficult.",
      "“He looks like he’s been there for years and that’s the biggest compliment I can give him.”",
      "Asked what that praise meant to him, Heaven said: \"It was more of a motivator again. I just wanted to play the next game and use it to fuel me. It always helps having someone say that about you.\""

      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

      "Bruno Fernandes has been criticised for his comments about the Saudi Pro League - with Ivan Toney suggesting that the Manchester United star may not have fully understood the quality of football in the Gulf State.",
      "Toney, who switched to Al-Ahli from Brentford last summer in a £40million deal, defended the league's standard during an interview with talkSPORT.",
      "The 29-year-old striker, who has scored 30 goals in 44 games for his new team, was recently called back into the England squad by Thomas Tuchel for upcoming matches against Andorra and Senegal.",
      "Responding to Fernandes' decision to reject a move to Al-Hilal, Toney said: \"That's his decision.",
      "\"He maybe thinks it's different to me. He obviously hasn't seen the league. The standard is high. I always say this - people always judge it on not seeing it, you know? And you have to see it first hand to have your own opinion. If people went there and went to some games, they'd soon realise.",
      "\"I know it's a good standard. You would never knock it once you've been there. It's tough.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Fernandes revealed that he had turned down a lucrative offer from Al-Hilal - after discussing it with his wife. That came amid suggestions of a would-be deal worth £100million to United.",
      "At a press conference before the game against Germany, Fernandes said: \"It was a very ambitious proposal,",
      "\"The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course. Then, I spoke to my wife and family - and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "\"It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",

      "United, as tempting as a £100m bid might have been for a soon-to-be 31-year-old, need players like Fernandes. He has been their best player of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era by some distance, and Amorim loves him.",

      "It's unprecedented for a club to pay £5m to break their obligation agreement and the ordeal is embarrassing for Sancho, whose career has sadly nosedived over the last few years.",
      "Sancho was an England international and one of the most exciting players in Europe when he arrived at Old Trafford. His decline began after signing for Manchester United and he failed to arrest his slump at Chelsea.",
      "The London-born lad scored in 4-1 victory against Real Betis in the Conference League final and will argue his loan was a success. Sancho will point to scoring in that game and his winner's medal. It's also important to note the move has collapsed due to Chelsea not being willing to meet his wage demands.",
      "That doesn't necessarily mean Chelsea don't want Sancho, but it does mean they don't believe he is worth the salary, and maybe that wouldn't have been an issue if he'd performed better.",
      "Sancho's contribution of five goals and 10 assists has been deemed not good enough for the wages he wants and Chelsea are set to move on to Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Chelsea want to sign Gittens in a £50million deal before the Club World Cup and Sancho should probably feel further embarrassment over that transfer for two different reasons.",
      "The first reason is that Gittens has leapfrogged Sancho, despite having been years behind him.",
      "Dortmund visited Leigh Sports Village to play United Under-19s in March 2022 and won on penalties, but a 16-year-old Gittens scored a brace in normal time and was the star of the show.",
      "At that time, Sancho had already spent eight months in Manchester after signing from Dortmund in a £72.9m transfer. He was regarded among the world's finest players, while Gittens was a teenager playing in front of a sparse crowd.",
      "The second reason is that Gittens is represented by the same agency - Elite Project Group - as Sancho. They know each other well and their career pathways have been similar.",
      "Sancho and Gittens both played in Manchester City's academy before joining Dortmund. There have been comparisons made between the pair and Gittens has given the impression of being a miniature Sancho.",
      "However, 'little brother' could surpass 'big brother' if he joins Chelsea this summer.",
      "Sancho will probably be happy for his agency stablemate Gittens and he might even advise him about what to expect at Cobham, although the optics of the move are not great for him.",
      "Gittens was just 16 and hadn't had a sniff of senior football when Sancho signed for United, so far apart were they in their careers, but that is clearly no longer the case.",
      "It must be said, Gittens always seemed destined to become a top player, but Sancho hasn't maintained his top player status and looks set to be surpassed by Gittens."

      "When Manchester United officials walk past supporters in their club suits, the key figures are easy to spot. Fans will be aware of high-profile chief executive Omar Berrada and football director Jason Wilcox. They will instantly recognise some of the Ineos figures, such as Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford.",
      "But Matt Hargreaves could stroll past without any recognition. Despite that, the former Adidas market director is a key figure in the corridors of power at Old Trafford and when it comes to the wheeler-dealer nature of the transfer window, arguably the most important person.",
      "This summer, Wilcox will work closely with Ruben Amorim to identify what the head coach requires, both in terms of incomings and outgoings. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell plays an important role in identifying targets and dealing with agents. Then, director of football negotiations Hargreaves seeks to strike deals with clubs for players United want to sign and for those potentially on their way out.",
      "Negotiating with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha was a relatively straightforward start to the window, given the Brazilian's release clause. It was simply a case of agreeing on a payment structure. However, Brentford have already made it clear they will drive a hard bargain for Bryan Mbeumo, despite the 25-year-old having only a maximum of two years left on his contract and having made his preference for a move to Old Trafford clear.",
      "But Hargreaves' skills might be tested most acutely when it comes to departures. Sales will make this window go round for United, and they need to extract maximum value for players leaving the club.",
      "In the case of Alejandro Garnacho, that might not be too difficult, given his age, talent and the level of performances he has already produced. Working against that will be the fact that Amorim has already made it clear he is finished at Old Trafford, giving buyers a pretty substantial edge in the market.",
      "Finding buyers for Marcus Rashford, Antony, and now Jadon Sancho might be more difficult. There will be pressure on Hargreaves as well, with Ratcliffe having made it clear he doesn't want the club to pay the wages of players who perform elsewhere. He wants the club to start bringing in more money and getting wages down, so sales rather than another loan will be the priority.",
      "One United source had previously declared the possibility of Chelsea deciding against signing Sancho permanently, and thereby paying a £5million penalty clause, as a \"win-win\" situation. You wonder if Hargreaves would have the same view.",
      "Chelsea taking the £25million option to sign Sancho would be the easiest course of action. Now, United must put the player back out to market and hope a club comes calling. The failure of the 25-year-old to agree personal terms with Chelsea suggests finding a club that can afford a fee and a salary package for the former England winger will be a challenge, although Hargreaves' ability to strike a fruitful deal with Borussia Dortmund to loan Sancho in January 2024 went down well at Old Trafford.",
      "The picture has changed since then, with Sancho about to head into the final year of his contract at the club and his future clearly lying away from United. A departure is required, which is also the case for Antony and Rashford. The former has at least enjoyed a productive loan spell with Real Betis, which United will hope to lead from interest elsewhere, as a permanent switch to Betis seems unlikely.",
      "Rashford's future also looks likely to lie away from Aston Villa. His spell in the Midlands was an encouraging return to form if not an outright success, but he once again has set his sights on Barcelona, despite the financial difficulties they are experiencing. Again, buyers have an upper hand in any potential deal for Rashford, with Amorim having made it clear he has no future under him.",
      "There had been an expectation that United could bank as much as £90million for Sancho, Antony and Rashford, but those sums are already beginning to look ambitious. Getting close to that figure will help supplement the transfer budget ahead of a season without European football, and all eyes will be on the least high-profile, but most important, executives in place at United."

This one seems to be getting further away, not closer.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is now ‘very keen’ on a move to Manchester United and a transfer expert has revealed what the Red Devils need to do in order to get the deal done for the Sporting star.",
      "After a dismal season saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and miss out on European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham, United are working quickly to secure signings to bolster Amorim’s squad ahead of his first full campaign in charge.",
      "Matheus Cunha has joined after United triggered his £62.5m release clause and a new bid is expected to be made for Bryan Mbeumo – who ‘wants to join’ the Red Devils – after Brentford rejected their initial £45m offer with £10m in add-ons.",
      "Brentford are asking for £60m for Mbeumo, while reports claim United are ‘prepared to meet Mbeumo’s whopping wage demands’ which stand at £250,000 a week, equating to £13m a year.",
      "The pair will likely play in the two inverted No.10 roles in Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, but United are also desperately looking for a new striker, with Rasmus Hojlund failing to meet the mark for them in his two seasons at the club.",
      "They were keen on Ipswich’s Liam Delap, but he’s opted to join Chelsea, but that move could open the door to Nicolas Jackson’s exit from Stamford Bridge, with United supposedly ‘interested’ in the Senegal international along with several other suitors.",
      "But according to a report on Wednesday, Amorim remains convinced that Gyokeres – who shone under the Portuguese boss in their time at Sporting together – is the man to lead the Red Devils’ line.",

      "‘Amorim is poised to win the battle to convince the hierarchy to recruit a proven goalscorer’, though United must sell at least one high-profile star in order to raise funds for the £59m star.",

      "And now transfer expert Ben Jacobs has revealed that Gyokeres is ‘very keen’ on a move to Old Trafford and explained how they can get the deal done for the 27-year-old.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “My understanding is that Viktor Gyokeres would be very keen on a move to Man United if they could pull that off, financially speaking.",
      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",

      "“He owes a lot to Thomas Frank. This is yet another example of why Frank is one of the best managers in the world, because he gets the best out of his players. He’s outstanding.",

      "Marcus Rashford’s ‘dream’ move to Barcelona is looking increasingly unlikely as Hansi Flick has reportedly ‘asked’ the Catalan chiefs to sign an alternative forward.",
      "Rashford is set to leave United this summer after a successful six-month loan spell at Aston Villa having fallen out with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Villa held a £40m option to make the England international’s move permanent, but their failure to qualify for the Champions League combined with Rashford’s desperation to join Barcelona has made that move highly unlikely.",
      "Rashford has been doing everything possible to secure a move to the Nou Camp, including changing his representatives and offering to take a significant wage cut amid Barcelona’s financial woes.",
      "Barca sporting director Deco confirmed last month that the club was interested in signing Rashford, along with Liverpool’s Luis Diaz.",
      "“We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players,” Deco told RAC1. “When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team.”",
      "One of those alternative names is Ademola Lookman, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, who claim Flick ‘has asked the sports management for his signing’.",
      "Liverpool have been heavily linked with the Nigerian, who has managed 52 goals and 25 assists in 118 appearances for Atalanta, but looks set to leave the Serie A club this summer.",
      "A report in Italy last month claimed that the Reds ‘dreamed of immediately bringing Lookman to Anfield’ in January, but Atalanta ‘did not want to lose him’ at a ‘crucial’ phase of the season.",
      "But it was added that Liverpool ‘will return to the attack’ for Lookman this summer, who is also ‘courted’ by Arsenal, Man Utd, Juventus and Napoli.",
      "Unsurprisingly, it was claimed that Atalanta ‘will not make any discounts’ and want 60 million euro (£50m) for their prized asset, but Liverpool ‘could include Chiesa in an exchange’.",
      "Fichajes claim Barcelona are hoping to secure his signing for significantly less than that – around the €30m [£25m] mark – with Flick seeing Lookman as ‘a key piece to revitalise his team’s offensive front’ and reduce the workload on Lamine Yamal and Raphinha.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘From the club’s offices, the name proposed by Flick is positively valued, although any movement will depend to a large extent on the departures that take place in the coming weeks. With several pieces already on the exit ramp, and the need to comply with the financial adjustment, the operation by Lookman could move forward if space is freed up in the template. For Flick, adding to the Nigerian would mean giving the project immediate dynamism and a constant threat in attack.’",
      "Aston Villa could pull off a de facto Manchester United swap, as they reportedly want to sign a Red Devils winger if they decide against a permanent raid for Marcus ...",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford could reportedly miss out on his dream transfer to Barcelona as the Catalan giants are now uncertain over a move.",
      "In which the Mirror do weird things with Bruno Fernandes quotes both ancient and modern, Florian Wirtz is absolutely furious and Mary Earps should be more like Joe Root.",
      "Premier League side Man Utd have been ‘offered’ a Barcelona player in exchange for Marcus Rashford this summer, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has explained why he thinks Matheus Cunha’s arrival will lead to two stars leaving this summer.",
      "Barcelona could make an offer for an Arsenal star if they fail to land Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer, according to reports."

      "After asking about the transfer of a new wing back from Ligue 1, Manchester United lost out, with their target agreeing to move to Inter Milan instead.",
      "United have had struggles in adapting to Ruben Amorim’s back three system. They went backwards from where they were when he took over, finishing 15th in the Premier League.",
      "The wing-back positions were seen as a particular area which needed improvement, given none of the players he inherited had ever really played the roles.",
      "Of late, Amorim looked into the signing of a player who has played that role on the right-hand side. TBRFootball reports that United, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Everton have all ‘asked about’ signing Marseille wide man Luis Henrique.",
      "He has played both as a winger and a wing-back in his career, and United wanted him for the latter of those roles, while the other clubs wanted Henrique to purely be a winger.",
      "He played both roles this season for Marseille, for whom he was directly involved in 19 goals in all competitions.",
      "It’s reported that Henrique was ‘intrigued’ over the prospect of a move to England, but he has instead chosen Inter Milan.",
      "Indeed, it’s believed he has agreed to move there, and will cost the Champions League finalists around £20million.",
      "The report states Henrique was ‘quick to accept’ once Inter had made their move. Should United still want to find a new right wing-back, they’ll have to look elsewhere.",
      "They have previously been linked with Denzel Dumfries, and there is a chance he becomes available now Henrique is heading to Milan.",
      "Dumfries frequents the right wing-back spot and Inter, and has done so to good effect, scoring and assisting 17 goals in all competitions this term, including some electric Champions League displays on the way to the final.",
      "He is clearly still at the top of his game, but he’s 29 and Henrique is 23, so if Inter were willing to sell, they’d know they had a quality replacement already lined up for years to come.",
      "That said, Henrique also played often as a left-winger this season, so that might be where Inter use him.",
      "With another option, though, sides like United could test the water to see if a move is possible for a player Gary Neville has advocated for them signing.",
      "He said after a Champions League game: “Do you know what I kept thinking, I was thinking with United playing with their back five and the wing-backs, I was thinking about that right wing-back Dumfries, for United.",
      "“I’d like to see him in the Premier League. Dumfries, how good was he? Unbelievable. He’s so good.”"

      "Sporting director Richard Hughes held talks with Bournemouth over a move for Dean Huijsen before the young Spaniard opted to move to Real Madrid, which has led the Reds to consider a surprise move for Branthwaite, according to the Daily Mail, who claim Liverpool have been ‘keeping a close eye’ on the centre-back.",

How much is ever or actually true? Probably less than 1%.",

      "Last year Chelsea were supposed to have ‘won’ the transfer window. And also ‘beaten’ Liverpool because of deals like Caicedo and Lavia. In reality, none shone as well as Gravenberch or indeed Mac Allister or Szoboszlai, all far less expensive.",

      "Fernandes staying isn’t necessarily good either. It’s funny and a little ironic that when playing for Portugal, who have a national team chock full of brilliant players, he has had less chance to shine as long as Ronaldo is the focus. But the same is true of the rest of the Utd team when Fernandes is playing. It’s all about him.",
      "Moving him on for big money, and allowing Amorim the chance the mold the team properly, with players that fit, may make more sense. Sure, Mbeumo is great and Cunha can go from great to sucking, but will they fit and can they fit around Fernandes? Not clear. But those are about the best signings Utd can get right now without European football.",
      "Liverpool, on the other hand, is banking on some high-risk, high-reward players. Kerkez, if they get him, is the most logical of those mooted right now. Pretty much a direct replacement for Robertson. Feisty, fast, gets forward. Might even be better than the younger version of Robertson.",
      "Frimpong and Wirtz are tricky. Frimpong is not only not a replacement for Trent, but his stats indicate he is neither a great defender nor a great forward. He might be a great wing-back, but Slot doesn’t usually play that way. He is fast, tricky, gets forward, gets into the box, and can go wide around Salah. So perhaps a way to get more out of Salah, allowing him to do his favourite thing and cut inside, and fill in when away at Afcon.",
      "Wirtz is not a winger nor a centre forward. He is more of a 10. Slot likes to play through the middle and not go wide. When playing against teams that block or high-press, he can excel. He is press-resistant but not in the same calm way as Gravenberch, but with clever flicks or the ability to dribble. Perhaps Slot realises Liverpool needed some alternative ways to break teams down, as they were easier to work out in the second half of the season.",
      "The point is, while I have said those things, we won’t know until the actual transfers are completed and the managers/coaches have had some pre-season time to get their ideas across and mould the new batch into a team. Based on last season, I would still feel Liverpool’s transfer business is going to be a lot more joined up than Utd’s.",

First of all, he is not a lightweight short arse (he is 177cm, for reference other good midfielders like Michael “the bison” Essien were 177cm, Roy Keane was 180cm at his peak playing career, he has lost some height since then, Joshua Kimmich-177cm, Moses Caicedo-177cm, Javier Mascherano-174cm, Joao Neves-177cm).",

      "3. Liverpool wants (needs?) him and he wants them-Liverpool players and fans have made it clear that they want to play with him. There is an a void in creating chances in that Liverpool team and you can see that he will fit in perfectly in filling it, a perfect match for both parties.",
      "4. He is young and that gives him a great opportunity to grow his career at a great club (he will be motivated and positive on playing for Liverpool even with changes that may impede his imminent rise).",
      "5. His signing (I hate to say this) will put Liverpool above other clubs in terms of stature and ultimately lure good players from other clubs.\nJamo, Nairobi",

      "Another bad take from Badwolf\nIt has been a long time since my last mail but seeing another bad take from Badwolf has forced my hand.",
      "Let’s start with selfish, which is defined as: “lacking consideration for other people; concerned chiefly with one’s own personal profit or please”. It does not take a genius to establish the selfish action here would have been (as captain and best player) to abandon Man Utd at their lowest ebb for the riches of Saudi oil money.",
      "Bruno is currently the only world-class player at the club, consistently ranking highest in the league (ahead of fan favourites like KdB and Odegaard) for chances created and has single handedly dragged Man Utd to any commendable position over the last 5 years – contributing 37 G/A this season. Yes he, along with the whole team, underperformed in the EL final however players have off days (see Haaland in the FA Cup final). Bruno has delivered big moments in big games; see assist for Mainoo in the FA cup final, penalty against Lyon to inspire the comeback not to mention that delightful lob against Liverpool last year.",
      "This apparent obsession with downplaying Bruno’s achievements stands in stark contrast to Badwolf’s defence of Rashford – who apparently does not have any attitude problems (despite frequently missing training / matches due to ‘illness’ following club nights out). It’s clear the culture has needed a fundamental reset after Pogba, Lindgard, Rashford, Sancho and by all means this is being achieved – we just need to shift the last two out the door.",
      "In terms of complaining about the rebuild, a reminder that we are 4 days into the transfer window and have (1) agreed a deal for Cunha, (2) become Mbeumo’s preferred destination and (3) kept our best player and captain against the lure of Saudi riches. Another reminder that the window closes September 1 which leaves sufficient time to hopefully progress and shift out more unwanted players.",
      "Lastly, unless a new set piece coach is going to sprinkle some human growth hormone in everyone’s tea to make them grow a couple of extra inches then I think you are vastly overestimating the impact they can have, without signing some taller, physical players. However, it would not be a Badwolf mail without a large dose of sensationalism. I fear we may have another Stewie on our hands at this rate.\nLOH, MUFC",
      "",
      "Bruno and basketball\nAll the talk about Bruno’s potential departure from United has made me draw comparisons from across the sporting world in my head. Disclaimer!!: I know basketball is far more impacted by individuals and there is no jeopardy in that they can’t get relegated but the thought experiment is fun anyway.",
      "The two teams in the NBA finals this year have both gone down the route of selling Bruno.",
      "Just 3 years ago, neither team made the playoffs and were not far off the bottom of their respective tables. In recent years OKC have traded away TWO mvps in favour of investing in youth, in return they received zero established stars and many draft picks, who hadn’t even proven they could play at that level at all (Equivalent would be signings from ligue 1 and below??) They now have another mvp and by far the most cohesive team unit and best defence in the league with a core that will last at least 3/4 years.",
      "Indiana have done similar, not quite as extreme but elected to get rid of their best player in order to take a chance on up and coming players. As a result (Coming back to football soon!), they have both made the finals and are both in the 4 highest scoring teams in a single playoff run in the past 40 years. One of them will win and the other will certainly be back next year.",
      "Back to United, the consensus seems that if they do return to the top end of the table, it will take at least 2/3 years, at which point Bruno will be presumably approaching the end. As much as I dislike the man, I have some respect for his ‘selfish’ ambition of staying at the top level and not pissing off to the desert to cosplay as a footballer.",
      "But football can and sometimes has to be a harsh business. United also already have some great young players, Diallo, Yoro, Mainoo (Don’t know what the story is with him) and even Zirkzee all are good players and will probably improve. Cash in on Garnacho and Hojlund while they can as well. If the United higher ups take a sort of universal approach to lessons of sports, they would find themselves at the same point OKC and Indiana did three years ago.",
      "If they back themselves to recruit properly (Big if) they could be competing again in 3 years, with a young core that will only improve. I would suggest setting up a standing order with Stade Rennais (Doué, Dembele, Camavinga, Raphinha, Doku, Cech etc…)",
      "As far as I’m aware, they also are in desperate need of money, and there’s only so many dinner ladies you can sack. Anyway, I don’t support United so if they did this and got even worse oh well, and I’m sure there’s some logical inconsistencies in the cross sport comparison but it’s interesting. Maybe even replace Onana with an NBA player! Great reach and can almost certainly catch a ball better than him, Wembenyana’s wingspan probably covers the entire goal and he can even do a few kick ups.\nC, Greece",

      "Ode to Bruno\nI see a lot of drivel bring written about Bruno Fernandes. It’s always worth noting that 14 teams finished above United without Bruno, so there’s nothing to suggest that Bruno (or any one player) is all that critical for success. But people who dismiss his ability or contribution need their head examined.",
      "Three things often get missed out in the Bruno stats comparisons. The first his is defensive work. Usually, we see the numbers around chances created, assists, and goal contributions, where he tops the United numbers handsomely, and is usually amongst the top few in the PL teams. But alongside that he also tops the United numbers for ball recoveries and interceptions.",
      "If you compare him to De Bruyne, Odegard, Enzo Fernandez, or Tielemans, you’ll see that in the just completed season, Bruno has more goal involvements than any of them, but he also completely dwarfs them when it comes to defensive stats. He has almost 3 times as many ball recoveries as Maddison, and more than twice as many as Odegard. In fact, he has more ball recoveries than Thomas Partey. I’m not sure who else is a better attacking AND defensive midfielder.",
      "The second is his effort. People are quick to point out his arm waving. Nobody complained when Keane was bawling out his teammates or Ferdinand was screaming at his midfielders. I’m actually not sure how Keane would have reacted to some of the play around him if it was like our last season. He would probably have punched a few of his own players. But putting aside these subtle cultural differences, it misses the point at Bruno’s running and minutes played stats have been amongst Europe’s best, across the top leagues. He is the player most likely to be making a tackle in his own penalty box and also attempting a volley in the opponents box within a few seconds.",
      "And the 3rd and probably most foundational point is his indestructability. At some point he will suffer injuries and I’ve probably just jinxed it. But his availability is a super-power. According to transfermarkt, he has missed a total of 6 games for club and country since 2016. That’s 6 games in 9 years, including 2 games for illness.",
      "And he seems to be a generally good egg in the dressing room, with fans, and with young players. He doesn’t sulk and shirk media duties, and fronts up more often than most others especially in this ghastly season. So yes, snide all you want but Bruno is every managers dream player, and I doubt very much there’s a single top level manager who wouldn’t have him if he was available to them.",
      "I started writing this a couple of days ago, when I thought he was leaving. As I said earlier, nobody’s irreplaceable. And sometimes a great player leaving can actually be the making of a team. But let’s not pretend that Bruno is anything but an elite player.\nVed Sen (Here’s to a few surprises next season), Man United.",

      "Manchester United have made a £55m offer for Bryan Mbeumo which is ‘some way below’ Brentford’s asking price for the forward.",
      "The United chiefs are working hard to bolster Amorim’s ailing squad that finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to secure European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s has completed his £62.5m move from Wolves, but there is far more work to do this summer amid rumours of several high-profile exits, with Alejandro Garnacho set to join Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho in leaving the club.",
      "It was claimed last month that United were planning to test Brentford’s resolve over Mbeumo by putting in a £50m bid for the winger, who got 20 goals and eight assists this season, with Brentford “open” to selling the 25-year-old, who is entering the last 12 months of his contract.",
      "And after The Athletic’s David Ornstein revealed on Monday that United were set to ‘open talks’ with Brentford, with Mbeumo ‘deciding he wants to join’ the Red Devils, the club chiefs have now made their opening bid.",
      "Ornstein’s report states:",
      "‘The proposal values Mbeumo at £45million plus £10m in add-ons, which is some way below the kind of fee it would take for Brentford to consider selling their Cameroon international forward.",
      "‘But talks are ongoing as United work to reach an agreement for a player targeted by head coach Ruben Amorim to strengthen his attacking unit.’",
      "It was previously claimed that the Bees want ‘in excess’ of £55million as they feel that Mbeumo is a ‘more proven’ Premier League player than Cunha, so a similar fee to what was paid for him – £62.5million – is seen as ‘realistic’.",
      "TBR Football’s Graeme Bailey did have some positive news for United though, claiming there’s “full confidence” in the deal and that there’s “already a broad agreement” between United and Mbeumo over his contract in a ‘major boost’.",
      "“Man United have come in with their opening offer…it’s not enough,” Bailey exclusively told TBR Football.",
      "“Brentford won’t take less than £60million – indeed they put him at least on par with Matheus Cunha at £62.5million, so United could very well need to go another £10million.",
      "“However, the two clubs are talking – and I am told there is full confidence of the deal going through. The player’s camp is already in broad agreement over terms.”",
      "Former Manchester United man Paul Parker has hailed a Red Devils target as a “dream signing” but feels he’s currently at the “best club in the world to play for.”",

      "These 10 Premier League players probably won’t be at the 2026 World Cup if they don’t move clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace and France)\nThere’s not much more Mateta can do at Crystal Palace to prove to Didier Deschamps that he’s worthy of a place in his France squad. He did enough for Thierry Henry to include him in the Olympics squad last year – as one of the three over-23 players – after scoring 14 goals in the second half of the 2023/24 Premier League season.",
      "After another 14 goals – this time across the whole of 2024/25 – Mateta still isn’t in Deschamps’ thinking. It might take a move away from Palace to change that. Will Europa League exploits be enough? Manchester United could do a lot worse…",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Manchester City and England)\nIt’s not gone particularly well for Grealish at Man City, though he has plenty of winner’s medals from his four years in Manchester. His goal and assist numbers have consistently disappointed and his best – and debatably only successful – campaign on an individual level came in 2022/23, when he played a crucial role in the club’s historic Treble-winning season.",
      "His inclusion in Lee Carsley’s first England squad raised a few eyebrows and rightly so, but the winger justified the decision with a goal against the Republic of Ireland – a delicious narrative drawn up by football’s scriptwriters. But Thomas Tuchel has not picked Grealish in his first two squads and the ex-Aston Villa captain now has a lot of work to do to earn a World Cup place.",
      "There’s no question that Grealish has to leave City this summer. That’s not just for the sake of his international career, but his career full stop. Pep Guardiola’s rotation bingo can frustrate the best, and while injuries haven’t helped, his transformation under Pep has been for the worse. The exciting, direct, risk-taking Grealish we loved has been stripped away. A move would help him rediscover himself – and maybe a place on the plane.",
      "",
      "Joao Pedro (Brighton and Brazil)\nIt doesn’t look like Pedro has much of a future at Brighton, with Chelsea reportedly interested in taking him off the Seagulls’ hands. A split seems inevitable after being left out of Fabian Hurzeler’s final two squads of the season following a training ground altercation (reportedly with Jan Paul van Hecke). Given he was the fall guy, we suspect Pedro was the one in the wrong.",
      "Brazil’s No.9 spot is wide open. New coach Carlo Ancelotti might prefer a winger through the middle – perhaps Rodrygo – but if he wants a more natural option, Pedro could still emerge as the go-to guy. The competition is Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus. Which says it all, really.",
      "Move to a bigger club, play more consistently, even just slightly up his game – and Pedro could be leading the line for Brazil next summer.",
      "",
      "Joshua Zirkzee (Manchester United and Netherlands)\nHe’s only been at Old Trafford a year, but that’s more than enough time for anyone. United’s summer intentions are clear: improve in attack. That doesn’t bode well for Zirkzee, who’s a long shot for Ronald Koeman’s World Cup squad as things stand.",
      "Zirkzee clearly has technical ability, but he’s lacked the physicality and end product to thrive in the Premier League. There’s been talk of a Serie A return – even on loan – and with Matheus Cunha already in, Bryan Mbeumo likely to follow, and a proper No.9 on the agenda, minutes will be hard to come by. No one knows his best position and there’s no European football to help showcase himself either.",

      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea and France)\nTalk of Nkunku leaving Chelsea isn’t new. Ending his Blues nightmare is essential to getting his career back on track and giving France another goalscoring option.",
      "Before moving to Stamford Bridge, he was one of Europe’s most highly rated forwards; he claimed 23 goals and nine assists in his final season at RB Leipzig after notching 35 goal contributions in the Bundesliga the year before. At Chelsea, he’s done well in the cups and Europe (11 goals in 15 games) but he’s barely started in the Premier League.",
      "Liam Delap’s arrival from Ipswich means even fewer minutes next season. Buying Nkunku is a risk, sure, but a calculated one. For the club, the player and for France, who could really do with Leipzig-era Nkunku in North America.",

      "Federico Chiesa (Liverpool and Italy)\nThere is no chance Chiesa makes it to the World Cup if 2025/26 is anything like his miserable debut season at Liverpool. Fourteen appearances. Four starts. Arne Slot’s side won the title at a canter and barely needed him.",
      "A serious knee injury after Euro 2020 prevented Chiesa from kicking on when he was being touted as one of the best wingers in the world. There was talk of a £100m move to the Premier League but he ended up joining Liverpool for around £12.5m in 2024.",
      "He’s now a shadow of his former self, and rotting on the bench helps nobody. Not him. Not Italy. He needs to accept defeat – urgently.",
      "",
      "Diogo Dalot (Manchester United and Portugal)\nDalot’s slipped down the pecking order at United following Erik ten Hag’s departure – not because of favouritism, but because he simply doesn’t suit Ruben Amorim’s three-at-the-back formation.",
      "His form has nosedived. There’s more room for improvement here than with most others on this list, but if he’s not trusted as a wing-back and can’t play centre-back, he’s going to spend a lot of time on the bench.",
      "United are open to selling anyone. They’d have flogged Bruno Fernandes if he’d been willing to move to Saudi Arabia. With a World Cup looming, this summer is pivotal for Dalot and friends.",
      "",
      "Niclas Fullkrug (West Ham and Germany)\nLike Pedro and Brazil, the No.9 spot is there for the taking for Germany. Kai Havertz is a shoo-in as things stand – and that’s not even his natural position. Then again, what is?",
      "West Ham’s 2024/25 season was a disaster. Fullkrug’s assessment of their “s**t” performances was the most entertainment they offered. The German needs service to score – and hasn’t had any. He didn’t adapt, and poor seasons from Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta and co. didn’t help.",
      "A swift return to the Bundesliga could be perfect. He scored 12 and assisted eight in 29 league games for Borussia Dortmund in 2023/24, and has 14 goals in 22 caps for Germany. If he stays at West Ham, the only justification for calling him up would be that goal record.",
      "",
      "Joe Gomez (Liverpool and England)\nGomez feels like a stellar squad player option for England, but even that might be out of reach if he spends another season doing next to nothing at Liverpool.",
      "It’s a surprise he hasn’t pushed for a move already. There’s no sign of him flying up Arne Slot’s defensive pecking order – not as a right-back, centre-back or left-back. That versatility makes him valuable for club and country. But not if no-one’s using it.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho (Manchester United and England)\nBack to square one, then? Where does Sancho go from here? A permanent exit from Manchester United is inevitable, but who’s going to take him?",
      "Swallowing his pride and moving to a West Ham or Crystal Palace might be his best option in the Premier League – they can offer European football, which United can’t. But it might be smarter to head abroad again. Borussia Dortmund gave him a lifeline and he repaid them by helping them reach a Champions League final. Maybe they’ll do him a favour again.",
      "Either way, Sancho needs to be playing regularly and impressively if he wants even a sniff of a World Cup return. Right now, he’s not even in the conversation.",

      "Chelsea have reportedly offered West Ham seven players in exchange for £85m forward Mohammed Kudus this summer in a bid to beat Manchester United to his signature.",
      "It was announced by The Athletic’s David Ornstein on Tuesday that Chelsea would not be taking up their £25m obligation to buy Jadon Sancho this summer after a loan spell at Stamford Bridge last season.",
      "Sancho and the Blues could not agree on personal terms and Chelsea will now be forced to pay a £5m penalty instead for not taking up the obligation.",
      "After the news was revealed, Sancho took to Instagram to pen a farewell message to Chelsea fans, he wrote: “Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home – team-mates, staff, and the fans.",
      "“Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful, thank you Blues.”",
      "The Blues are therefore in the market for a new forward to play to the side of a central striker and it’s claimed they have reignited their interest in Kudus having been linked with the 24-year-old when he made his £38m to West Ham from Ajax in the summer of 2023.",
      "And according to transfer expert Graeme Bailey, the Blues have offered the Hammers seven players in a swap deal for Kudus, who reportedly has an £85m release clause.",
      "Robert Sanchez has been brought up in talks as they look to bring Milan’s Mike Maignan in as their new No.1, while midfielders Carney Chukwuemeka and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall as well as defenders Tosin Adarabioyo, Benoit Badiashile, Axel Disasi and Trevoh Chalobah have also been offered up in exchange.",
      "He told The Chelsea Chronicle: “So, I’m told that there’s been talk with West Ham a little bit about possibly looking at Kudus and with players in exchange.",
      "“I believe that Chelsea were offering Sanchez and Dewsbury-Hall but West Ham didn’t want that particularly, so yeah that’s an interesting one. Kudos, again a name who could be one to keep an eye on but obviously if it means Chelsea getting these players out. Dewsbury-Hall, we know is someone who can go. Robert Sanchez is one who they’re willing to let go which tells us about the goalkeeper situation.",
      "“West Ham we know were interested in Chalobah, Disasi, Tosin and Badiashile I think two or three of them are going to leave, but I think they want money for them, especially Tosin and Chalobah, because of the pure profit. I think Chukwuemeka has been mentioned as well to West Ham.”",

      "A report earlier on Wednesday claimed Manchester United have also tried to tempt West Ham into a swap deal for Kudus, offering Sancho in exchange.",
      "The report added that West Ham and Man Utd ‘couldn’t reach an agreement, so it currently seems unlikely that this will go through’.",
      "Kudus has been the subject of interest from Liverpool and Arsenal during his time in England, while there have also been links to Saudi Arabia, but the midfielder ‘would prefer to stay in Europe’.",
      "Man Utd are desperate to offload Jadon Sancho this summer and have offered him as part of a swap deal for a West Ham star, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are ready to make a ‘massive offer’ to sign West Ham attacking midfielder Mohamed Kudus in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",

      "If that is the case, he would of course have no say on the future of Paz – unless he wanted to sign him for Inter – and whoever takes over at Como would not have the same connection Fabregas has with the midfielder, and could be open to his sale.",

      "Manchester City are heavily represented in a list of the 20 most expensive forwards in transfer history. Matheus Cunha is in but No 1) will never be shifted.",
      "",
      "1) Neymar – £200m/€222m (Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2017)\nA fee so ridiculous La Liga refused to receive the payment so PSG said LOL to FFP and handed the money straight to Barcelona, activating one of those stratospheric release clauses designed to typically make such transfers essentially impossible.",
      "",
      "2) Eden Hazard – £143m/€160m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, July 2019)\nThe initial payment of £88.5m alone would have been a disastrous transfer, but Hazard accidentally activated enough variables in between numerous injuries before his retirement to make this an all-time great waste of money.",
      "",
      "3) Philippe Coutinho – £142m/€160m (Liverpool to Barcelona, January 2018)\nIt’s difficult to pinpoint the most damning aspect of this deal from a buyer’s perspective, but it’s somewhere between the £106m initial fee, the £26.4m in clauses paid out for Coutinho’s first 90 appearances, the £89m premium Barcelona reluctantly agreed to pay if they signed any further Liverpool players in the next two years, the fact Coutinho won the Champions League with Bayern Munich while on loan from the Nou Camp, scoring twice in the 8-2 quarter-final humiliation of the Catalans, or the knockdown price of £17m paid by Aston Villa after four underwhelming years.",
      "",
      "4) Ousmane Dembele – £135m/€147m (Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona, August 2017)\nWith a bruised ego and the Neymar cash burning a hole in their back pocket, Barcelona had tried all summer to sign Coutinho but after facing resistance from Liverpool, they went cap in hand to Dortmund for their back-up instead. And lessons were learned with a £369.6m release clause inserted this time – not that the Frenchman has ever come close to warranting such lavish interest until he found his ambipedal feet at PSG.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Felix – £113m/€126m (Benfica to Atletico Madrid, July 2019)\nPerhaps the worst match of player and manager there has ever been for a club-record transfer. How strange that the skilful individualist forward who doesn’t track back never meshed with a totalitarian coach who demands suffering and sacrifice from his subordinates. How strange that Atletico committed such sums on a teenager with 45 career first-team appearances. How strange that they couldn’t find anyone to buy him until Chelsea rocked up again.",
      "",
      "6) Antoine Griezmann – £107m/€120m (Atletico Madrid to Barcelona, July 2019)\nAfter The Decision favoured Atletico in 2018, the Frenchman could no longer avoid the Barcelona pull a year later in a sale which enraged Los Rojiblancos, considering a £180m release clause had only expired a couple of weeks before. Griezmann has somehow managed to remain without a La Liga winner’s medal through it all, timing his moves back and forth to Atletico and Barca comedically poorly.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish – £100m/€117.5m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nWhile it looked like an ungainly fit at first, Grealish went an awfully long way towards justifying his astronomical fee as a key part of a Treble-winning, mass-celebrating machine in his second season at the Etihad. Then it all started to fall apart again as he lost his way.",
      "",
      "8) Neymar – £86.3m/€100m (Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal, August 2023)\nThat world-record, market-breaking move to France delivered neither the Ballon d’Or nor the non-Barcelona Champions League that Neymar craved, so the Brazilian decided to cheat by joining the most successful side in AFC Champions League history for loadsa money, loadsa cars, loadsa bedrooms and loadsa saunas. A ruptured knee ligament meant he played seven times in Saudi Arabia before being released by mutual consent.",
      "",
      "9) Gareth Bale – £85.2m/€100m (Tottenham to Real Madrid, September 2013)\nAfter cramming half of his total Premier League goals by that point into a single phenomenal season, Bale became the latest obsession of a Real Madrid side desperate to win La Decima. The Welshman helped deliver that in his first campaign with a decisive goal in the Champions League final – the first of five European Cups and second of 15 trophies for a player the supporters nevertheless came to hate.",
      "",
      "10) Antony – £82m/€95m (Ajax to Man Utd, September 2022)\nErik ten Hag put all his eggs in the Antony basket but a few must have cracked in transit from Amsterdam, the relatively slow and predominantly one-footed winger scoring eight goals and assisting three in a 44-game debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – £73m/€85m (Borussia Dortmund to Man Utd, July 2021)\nIn his three full seasons with Borussia Dortmund, Sancho’s least productive campaign was his first, when he scored 13 goals and provided 20 assists in 43 games. Across an entire Man Utd career which still technically remains a live thing after Chelsea paid £5m to return him rather than £25m to sign him, the forward has scored 12 goals and assisted six in 83 games.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe – £72m/€80m (Lille to Arsenal, August 2019)\nAfter offering the closest challenge to Kylian Mbappe for the Ligue Un Golden Boot, Arsenal spent what was a club-record fee on a player who has popped up around France, Turkey and Spain since being long outgrown by the upwardly mobile Gunners.",
      "",
      "13) Neymar – £71.5m/€86.2m (Santos to Barcelona, June 2013)\nThe financial details are wonderfully murky but official documents submitted to the authority revealed the final fee, as well as a €40m payment to Neymar’s parents.",
      "",
      "14) Kai Havertz – £71m/€80m (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, September 2020)\nExpensive flop who never fit into one defined position and suffered for regular managerial upheaval? Or scorer of the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals? A little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "",
      "15) Julian Alvarez – £64m/€75.8m (Manchester City to Atletico Madrid, August 2024)\nThe fee could rise to £80m but eyebrows were raised when Manchester City squeezed quite so much out of Atletico, even for a world champion with 54 goal contributions and six trophies in 103 appearances. A 29-goal debut season in Spain made it seem more as though the Premier League side had been fleeced.",
      "",
      "16) James Rodriguez – £63m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nA proper throwback transfer pretty much solely down to Rodriguez starring at the World Cup, the Colombian won a fair few trinkets at the Bernabeu but never came close to settling or justifying that fee.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Cunha – £62.5m/€74.2m (Wolves to Man Utd, June 2025)\nIn a welcome sign they are returning to a formerly successful transfer policy, Manchester United chucked a whole load of money at a team below them in the Premier League’s bottom half by virtue of goal difference alone.",
      "",
      "18) Kai Havertz – £62m/€71.7m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nMikel Arteta saw enough in those three mixed years at Stamford Bridge to deem Havertz crucial to his Arsenal process. Almost no-one else thought it was a signing worth making but the vision has become clearer over time, particularly so in the German’s injury-enforced absence.",
      "",
      "19) Mykhaylo Mudryk – £62m/€70m (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, January 2023)\nThe biggest possible fee is the one most often quoted but Chelsea would be absolutely delighted if they end up paying the full £88.5m/€100m for Mudryk, who is embroiled in a drugs test fiasco.",
      "",
      "20) Riyad Mahrez – £60m/€68m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nAn underappreciated Premier League legend only reinforced his status at Manchester City. Just 10 players have won more Premier League titles – none of whom have a medal with two different clubs – than Mahrez, who ranks joint 53rd all-time for goals and 21st for assists.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 08:02, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered a four-player shortlist of players Manchester United must let go this summer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window as United boss is a crucial one as he tries to assemble a squad capable of bouncing back from an all-time Premier League low finish of 15th place.",
      "United also finished the campaign trophyless, having suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, denying the club a return to the Champions League.",
      "However, Neville believes there will be an emphasis on outgoings with an inevitability surrounding some members of the squad. The former United captain believes Marcus Rashford is among the players who must leave this window.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",
      "\"From Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville also namedropped Alejandro Garnacho and Antony as two names who should also be shown the door after both players have recently publicly expressed that their respective futures at Old Trafford are uncertain. Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"Antony is perfect for Spain, and United should facilitate him leaving. Best for United, best for the club.\"",
      "After United's defeat to Spurs, Garnacho spoke to the media after the game to express his discontent at not starting the game. \"We'll see what happens,\" said Garnacho regarding his future after a scathing review of his side's performances.",
      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",
      "However, Neville took a different view in regards Kobbie Mainoo, with the 20-year-old's future reportedly also in doubt.",
      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "Matheus Cunha set for Man Utd after they triggered the £62.5m release clause in the Brazil international's contract at Wolves; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wanted to play at Old Trafford and was not deterred by their failure to qualify for the Champions League",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 07:39, UK",
      "Manchester United have announced an agreement for the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Cunha will become Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League - and the club have moved swiftly to seal the transfer on the opening day of the window.",
      "The 26-year-old is set to sign a five-year deal at United with the option for a further year.",
      "Cunha leaves Wolves as a club-record sale after United met his £62.5m release clause, agreeing to a structure of payment over two years. His signing is subject to visa and registration, say United.",
      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Wolves are happy Cunha's move has gone through as quickly as possible. The release clause which was inserted in his new contract in January has protected their position.",
      "Nobody at Wolves wanted a long drawn out saga involving the player during the summer. They will receive the full release clause in the terms set out in the contract - in three instalments payable by the summer of 2027. United were initially offering to pay in five instalments.",
      "Wolves expect to be busy this summer to build on the progress made under Vitor Pereira last season. They proved they were not a one-man team with their results and performances when Cunha was suspended.",
      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "United are understood to have been impressed with Cunha's desire to join, whether they had European football or not.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "\"Day one of this mini transfer window and Manchester United have confirmed their first signing.",
      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",
      "\"So Manchester United will have to pay a third of that transfer fee now and then the other two will come at the end of the next two seasons.",
      "\"It was in process from the end of the season. We were getting wind that Manchester United wanted to sign Cunha and he was really open to the move to Old Trafford.",
      "\"I'm sure that United will hope that now they've got someone like Cunha coming to the club, it might pave the way for way for other players.",
      "\"United still have that pulling power and the Cunha signing demonstrates that.",
      "\"This summer transfer window is going to be really important for United, particularly because it is Amorim's first summer transfer window.",
      "\"There are so many issues he has to deal with, so many player futures up in the air at the moment.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."
