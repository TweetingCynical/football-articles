      "Wayne Rooney has admitted that his time at Birmingham City was an 'absolute car crash', pinpointing the exact moment he knew that it would not work out at St Andrews. Following the culmination of his playing career, Rooney went into management but found it difficult to replicate his playing successes in the dugout.",
      "Derby County, DC United and Plymouth Argyle all employed Rooney. But it was the former Manchester United, Everton and England striker spell at Birmingham under their American ownership which ended in the worst possible manner.",
      "In just shy of three months, Rooney managed to win only two matches and he was quickly sacked at the beginning of January having not been given the opportunity to sign a single player of his own. In a sit-down interview with former United teammate Rio Ferdinand on his 'Rio Ferdinand Presents' YouTube channel, the 39-year-old admitted that the spell in the West Midlands was particularly bad",
      "\"I think I took very difficult jobs,\" Rooney said. \"Obviously, I was at Derby [as a player] and then I went in as manager and then they went in administration.",
      "\"Then I went out to the US and managed DC United, which people actually think and talk about that as if it was a big failure. DC United finished bottom the three seasons before I went in, and then we missed out on playoffs by a point, and then when I left, they went back to the bottom and people don't talk about that.",
      "\"Then I went to Birmingham, which was an absolute car crash from day one, to be honest. The fans never said that.",
      "\"I remember we played Middlesbrough away in the first game, we lost 1-0 in the 90th minute. Then we played Hull at home.",
      "\"I remember I walked out and my first game at home, and I'm stood there, and the players are shaking hands and I'm over there. And there was a Birmingham fan behind me: 'Get back to America, you fat c***.'",
      "\"I turned around, I was laughing. I turned around, I was like, 'give me a chance'.",
      "\"And so that was just never right at the time of when I went in. It was just never... It weren't a good fit.\"",
      "Rooney's comments come after Birmingham co-owner Tom Brady questioned his work ethic in the dugout. Speaking on the Amazon Prime documentary Brady & The Blues: Birmingham City which released last month, the NFL icon was filmed saying to business manager Ben Rawitz: “I’m a little worried about our head coach’s work ethic.\"",
      "After being sacked from his most recent role at Plymouth on New Year's Eve, Rooney's attention has been drawn away from management. The former striker now appears to be focusing on a career in punditry after joining the freshly revamped Match of the Day.",
      "He also features in a BBC podcast - The Wayne Rooney Show - alongside Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd. He has also appeared on the Stick to Football podcast alongside his ex-United teammates Gary Neville and Roy Keane while also joining Amazon Prime's coverage of the Champions League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United will hope the 2-1 victory over Chelsea last weekend breathes new life into their season. Being knocked out of the EFL Cup already and not partaking in European football this season means Ruben Amorim's men will have had a week's break by the time they take on Brentford on Saturday.",
      "The Premier League clash at the Gtech Community Stadium follows the recent action-packed win at Old Trafford, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro. United made the extra man count following goalkeeper Robert Sanchez's early red card for the Blues, before Casemiro himself was sent off on the stroke of half-time.",
      "Harry Kane could make his return to the Premier League next summer due to a reported secret clause in his contract. The England captain joined Bayern Munich two years ago and remains under contract until June 2027.",
      "But German outlet Bild reports Kane could be available for a cut-price of £56.7million next year, provided that he informs Bayern of his decision to leave before the end of the January transfer window. Such a request would come as a surprise given Kane has settled in well in Bavaria, winning the first trophies of his career and already scoring eight goals this season.",
      "But a return to the Premier League after the 2026 World Cup, at which point he will be 33 years old, would give him the chance to break Alan Shearer’s record as the English top flight’s all-time leading goal scorer.",
      "United, having tried to sign Kane in the past, could be keen to snap up the former Spurs star, despite Amorim's revamp of his attacking line-up with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. They may also face competition from Tottenham, given their first-option agreement from when they facilitated Kane's transfer to Germany in 2023.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has admitted he would love to take on the Manchester United job. The 44-year-old has enjoyed a growing reputation in Germany for his work with the Bundesliga side, having led them to the Champions League.",
      "Premier League fans may know him as the head coach that managed to get the best out of Omar Marmoush and Hugo Ekitike, both of whom sealed big money moves to the English top flight this year. And Toppmoller has suggested he wouldn’t turn down a move to United if he was offered Amorim’s job.",
      "“Basically, it’s a dream to be at Eintracht now,” he said, as per Bild. “It’s simply a fantastic club. Here, as a teenager, I witnessed for the first time that my father was a Bundesliga coach. That naturally creates an emotional bond with a club.",
      "“Thinking about abroad, I often played computer games as a child, always with one team: Manchester United. That would definitely be nice someday, because it’s an extraordinary club.",
      "“When I was a teenager, Manchester United was, along with Real Madrid, the biggest club of all.”",
      "The manager received a big money offer to join Saudi Pro League side Al-Ittihad in the summer, which he rejected. And he is already familiar with Manchester, should he replace the under the pressure Amorim at Old Trafford, having joined Manchester City on loan in 2001 - though he did not make an appearance for the club.",

      "Antony was Real Betis' inspiration as the Spanish side held Nottingham Forest to a 2-2 draw in the Europa League on Wednesday night. Ange Postecoglou's side dominated proceedings in Seville, but were denied victory by Antony's equaliser.",
      "Antony left Manchester United in a £21.65million permanent deal on transfer deadline day, having enjoyed himself on loan in Spain last season. While he flopped following an £82m transfer from Ajax to United, the Brazilian has already become a hero at Betis.",
      "Forest were celebrating a return to European football for the first time in nearly 30 years, but couldn't secure the first win of the Postecoglou era as the former Tottenham boss made it four games at his new club without victory. Forest striker Igor Jesus scored twice, yet it was Antony who had the last laugh.",
      "The Betis winger first found Cedric Bakambu, who opened the scoring with a powerful finish into the roof of the net. Jesus equalised with a tap-in before putting Forest 2-1 up with a header from a corner.",
      "But Antony popped up at the back post in the 85th minute to equalise before celebrating by pointing to a tattoo on his neck which reads “iluminado\" - a Portuguese word which translates as “illuminated” or “the chosen one”. Betis fans certainly won't be arguing with him after another crucial performance which means he has nearly passed his total of goals and assists for United in a fraction of the time with his new club.",
      "United owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe cited Antony as the sort of missteps in the transfer market that he wants to eliminate now Ineos have taken over the club. \"If you look at the players we are buying this summer, that we didn't buy, we're buying Antony, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying [Jadon] Sancho,\" Ratcliffe told the BBC.",
      "\"These are all things from the past, whether we like it or not, we've inherited those things and have to sort that out. Some are not good enough and some probably are overpaid. But for us to mould the squad that we are fully responsible for, and accountable for, will take time. We've got this period of transformation where we move from the past to the future.\"",
      "United made a huge loss in selling Antony to Betis this summer and his performances in Spain won't please Ratcliffe if they continue. With United not playing in any European competition this season, having finished 15th in the Premier League last season and lost the Europa League final, the petrochemicals billionaire had to go elsewhere for his football fix on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe was spotted in the stands of his other club, Nice, but it wasn't happy viewing for him in the south of France either. Nice were beaten 2-1 by Roma in the Europa League thanks to goals from Evan Ndicka and Gianluca Mancini.",
      "United will be back in action this weekend against Brentford when Ratcliffe will hope they can build on their 2-1 win over Chelsea. He may secretly be hoping that Antony's form for Sevilla stalls, while Onana, Hojlund and Sancho will be trying to prove him wrong while on loan at Trabzonspor, Napoli and Aston Villa respectively.",

      "Manchester United and Barcelona are set to hold off on talks about a permanent deal for Marcus Rashford until the end of the season, according to reports. After falling out of favour with Ruben Amorim, Rashford switched to Spain on a season-long loan.",
      "The 27-year-old snubbed other potential moves to join Hansi Flick's side following a brief stint at Aston Villa. Since he arrived at the Nou Camp, Rashford has netted twice and provided two assists in six matches.",
      "Rashford's current loan deal includes an option for Barcelona to purchase him for a pre-agreed fee of £26.2million. Before this option is exercised, the striker's development on and off the pitch and the club's financial situation will be considered.",
      "Another factor to consider is Robert Lewandowski's future. The 37-year-old's contract in Spain is due to expire at the end of the season, and Rashford's ability to operate as a No.9 could play a pivotal role in determining the futures of both players.",
      "\"I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, every player my age has watched them play, it's amazing football.\"",
      "When questioned about the duration of his stay in Spain, he responded: \"As many [seasons] as possible. We will see.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' actions have left their mark on his Manchester United team-mates with goalkeeper Dermot Mee recalling how the captain gave him a signed shirt on their first meeting - despite him losing their bet.",
      "Mee came through the ranks at Walsall but the 22-year-old moved to Manchester in 2019. After continuing to impress in the youth ranks he was invited to train with the first-team once he was 18 and engaged in a competition with Fernandes.",
      "The young goalkeeper was tasked with saving two of five shots from the Portuguese playmaker with the prize being a signed shirt from the United captain. Mee failed, but Fernandes still produced a shirt regardless with his gesture leaving its mark on him.",
      "United put out a video on social media with players asked to recall their favourite Fernandes moment and the goalkeeper recalled: \"Probably say when I was about 18, first time I went up and trained with them, he gave me a bet - If I could save two out of five of his shots he'd give me a signed shirt. I didn't do it but he went and got me one anyway.",
      "In an effort to go and further his development Mee, who is yet to make an appearance for the Manchester outfit, has had loan spells in non-league with the likes of Witton Albion and Altrincham. The goalkeeper has previously travelled to San Diego for a training camp and pre-season friendly against Wrexham.",
      "Fernandes has long been regarded as the team's talisman and a host of his team-mates referenced other major moments during his United career. Several players talked up his free-kick against Arsenal last season, a game that finished 1-1.",
      "The 31-year-old also enjoyed a memorable moment at Old Trafford against Liverpool back in April 2024, which too was referenced by the likes of Kobbie Mainoo. Fernandes was quick to seize on a mis-placed pass by the Reds and hammered home a shot first time.",
      "His effort caught Caoimhin Kelleher out of position and levelled a contest that eventually finished 2-2. Other moments included a hat-trick scored by the playmaker against Real Sociedad last term in a 4-1 win in the Europa League.",
      "Fernandes remains the team's leading light and he's scored in both of their wins so far this season. He scored a stoppage time penalty to down Burnley at Old Trafford and was also on target at the weekend when United beat Chelsea.",

      "Amorim retains the support of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos for the time being, but he is only another succession of poor results away from that stance changing. And Toppmoller has thrown his hat into the ring if the United hierarchy do end up looking for a replacement.",

      "The club's great goalscorer was poised to sign a new deal in 2010 but wanted clarity on the club's direction after he'd seen his fellow forwards Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez both sold by the Red Devils. United had just lost the league title to Chelsea and Rooney wanted to know who they were signing.",
      "Ferguson didn't take kindly to his authority being questioned and the pair clashed, leading to Rooney putting in a transfer request. The saga lasted just a matter of days before the Evertonian penned a new contract.",
      "But looking back Rooney claims his concerns were later realised. The Manchester outfit won the top flight in 2011 and 2013, but with an ageing squad that lacked the superstar talent of yesteryear and Rooney believes no answer has ever been offered as to what the club's plan was.",
      "He said on Rio Meets Wayne: \"I think that question I asked then, in 2010, it still hasn't been answered, been addressed, from 2010. And I think fans have seen... I don't think, if fans look back, they'd be like, you know what, he actually seen what was coming a little bit. And I don't think it's been fixed since 2010.\"",
      "United have failed to even challenge for the title since 2013 with David Moyes and Louis van Gaal coming in after Ferguson, but both men were left to transition an ageing squad. Huge sums were spent, but recruitment has been a major issue with Rooney holding on to the fact that his concerns in 2010 were legitimate.",
      "He added: \"Well, if I look back to 2010, I don't think it has. I don't think, we obviously won the league in 2013, but lots changed, obviously. Commercially, social media, everything changed. But I still think when we lost Ronaldo and Tevez, from that moment, we got Robin in, obviously, for a couple years.",
      "\"But from that moment the club has never had a group of forwards who... Look, before my time, with Teddy, with Solskjaer, Coley, Yorkie. Then you've got me, Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov, Saha. From that moment, the club has never had a group of forwards who can all play and come win you games. And that is Man United.\"",
      "Rooney admits with the benefit of hindsight maybe his decision to challenge Ferguson wasn't right, but ultimately claimed \"I still think I had a right to ask the question.\" The forward was unsure whether the club were entering a period of transition, which ultimately has proven to be the case.",

      "Tuchel's decision to look elsewhere has come with Mainoo becoming a frustrated figure at Old Trafford at his lack of action. He has struggled for regular starts under Amorim and his career has gone backwards in the last 12 months. And amid his frustrations, Mainoo remains keen - should things not improve at United - to seal a loan move in the next transfer window.",

Thus, Mainoo has accepted he will have no choice but to request another loan move elsewhere in January, should he still find himself on the fringes of Amorim's team.",

      "Wayne Rooney has lifted the lid on his alcohol addiction - and admitted he could have died if it hadn't been for the help of his wife Coleen. Rooney is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation, following a stellar career with England and Manchester United.",
      "The former striker remains United's greatest ever goalscorer, and led the England charts as well until being overtaken by Harry Kane. But Rooney, appearing on the ' Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast', has revealed how he faced a constant battle with the booze.",
      "Rooney admits he went to such lengths to hide his drinking from Sir Alex Ferguson, that he put eye drops in and chewed gum before heading out to training.",
      "Rooney said: \"I wanted to go out and enjoy my time with my friends and having a night out. It got to a point where I went too far, of course it did. That was a moment in my life where I was struggling massively. With alcohol. Massively struggling and I didn't think I could turn to anyone.",
      "\"I didn't really want to, because I didn't want to put that burden on anyone. I remember going into training and putting eyes drops in, chewing gum.",
      "\"I just drank for two days straight. Go training and at the weekend, I'd scored two goals and then I'd go back and go and drink for two days straight again.\"",
      "Rooney believes Coleen saved his life and he added: \"Coleen is massive. It's bad because we're two kids from Croxteth, and then we grew up together and obviously we started dating and got married and have kids. But when I was 17 she could see, she knew my mind and she knew I was a bit out there.",
      "\"You know, I loved my football. I was obsessed with football, but also I loved a night out or whatever going out. She's seen it very early on, and she's controlled that. Well, not controlled, but helped me control that massively.",
      "\"And at times you're like, 'what are you doing? Why do you keep saying don't do this or don't do that? I honestly believe if she wasn't there I'd be dead. I believe that.",
      "\"I've made mistakes in the past, which are well documented and whatever, but I'm a little bit different at times and she keeps me on that path. She's done it for 20-odd years.\"",

      "Manchester United's Diogo Dalot is set to return from injury, leaving boss Ruben Amorim with a defensive headache ahead of Saturday's lunchtime clash with Brentford.",
      "Dalot, who was absent for United's last two matches against Manchester City and Chelsea, participated in training on Tuesday and will be part of the squad travelling to Brentford.",
      "Like many of his teammates, Dalot has had an inconsistent start to the season but shone in the dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley at Old Trafford before the international break.",
      "In the triumph over the Clarets, Dalot showcased his attacking prowess in the left wing-back position, setting up Bryan Mbeumo's first Old Trafford goal. Had it not been for an injury sustained while on international duty with Portugal, Dalot would likely have started against City and Chelsea, but Noussair Mazraoui took his place in both games.",
      "Despite questions surrounding Dalot's defensive discipline and reliability, United boss Amorim appreciates his work rate and energy, crucial attributes for his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "There are also concerns about Dalot's final ball when he finds himself in threatening positions in the final third, although his assist for Mbeumo – running onto a flick-on from Joshua Zirkzee and then cutting the ball back inside for the goal – served as a reminder of his attacking capabilities.",
      "Patrick Dorgu appears to have secured his position as the left wing-back, leaving Dalot, Mazraoui and Amad to vie for the right-wing back role. Despite being the most offensive of the trio, Amad has struggled to find form and consistency this season.",
      "In the match against Chelsea, Mazraoui and Dorgu took on the wing-back roles, while Amad was positioned as one of the two No.10s, supporting Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Given that Dalot hasn't played a competitive game in four weeks, it's likely that Amorim will stick with the same line-up that served him well against Enzo Maresca's side for the Brentford match, despite the victory margin being narrower than necessary.",
      "Looking ahead, it'll be interesting to see if Amorim settles on a regular defensive line-up, as he has done with midfield and attack. In midfield, his go-to pairing is Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, although Casemiro is suspended for Saturday's game following his red card against Chelsea.",
      "His preferred attacking trio consists of summer signings Matheus Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko.",
      "However, there's more uncertainty in defence. Amorin seemed to have settled on a central three of Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro, only to drop Yoro for the Chelsea game in favour of Harry Maguire, who put in an excellent performance on Saturday and would be unfortunate not to retain his place.",
      "Dalot, on the other hand, faces a tough battle to regain his spot in the starting line-up, a task that will become even more challenging if he's left out of Saturday's squad and United manage to clinch consecutive Premier League victories under Amorim for the first time.",

      "Premier League legend Alan Shearer has criticised Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford for unprofessional behaviour after the 27-year-old was benched for being late to a meeting. The former Newcastle forward issued a stern warning about the Barcelona forward's professionalism.",
      "The disciplinary action from Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick came just days after Rashford's pivotal two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League - his first goals since his high-profile summer switch to the La Liga heavyweights from United. Fears had been sparked after issues plagued his development at Old Trafford which led to his role within the squad diminishing.",
      "Despite being relegated to the bench for Getafe's visit, Rashford entered the fray and set up Dani Olmo for a goal in their 3-0 triumph on Sunday. Rashford secured his move to a Champions League side during the summer transfer window after Aston Villa didn't exercise their buy option for the England international.",
      "Rashford was just two minutes late for the Barcelona pre-match team meeting but falls out of line with the German tactician's zero tolerance policy. Shearer has warned that such lapses in professionalism won't be overlooked at an establishment of Barcelona's stature.",
      "\"Rashford can't be unprofessional, it's not right,\" Shearer told Betfair. \"We know that if Rashford is ready and if his attitude is right then there's a player in there.",
      "\"He was sensational against Newcastle. The second finish in particular was amazing. But you can't be unprofessional.",
      "\"Why should everyone hang around just for you? Why should everyone else be on time but you be late? It's not right.",
      "\"I guess if he wants to stay there, particularly only being on-loan, you can't do that when you're at a top club like Barcelona because there'll always be someone to take your place.",
      "\"It doesn't matter if you're two minutes late or 20 minutes late. You're late and your teammates have to wait for you. Why should they all be on time and you not?\"",
      "Barcelona stars Raphinha and Jules Kounde have also punished for their lateness by Flick. Shearer's comments come after former Red Devils midfielder Paul Scholes accused the attacker of 'quitting' during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Scholes said: \"There’s no doubt the talent that kid has got, it’s ridiculous, he’s shown up in a big game, and that second goal was brilliant.",
      "\"I really struggled to feel happy for him, to feel pleased for him. Look, if you fell out with a manager, then OK, but remember, you’ve got team-mates you’re playing with.",

      "\"The amount of times I saw him at United walking because he wants to leave, I thought his whole demeanour was a disgrace. I think he actually quit on Manchester United. And once you quit once, you’ll quit again.\"",

    "body": [
      "It was always likely to be a busy summer at Manchester United following a campaign which resulted in the club's lowest ever finish of the Premier League era.",
      "And so it proved as the Red Devils spent over £200million on new recruits while moving on a number of stars who had been deemed surplus to requirements. United have gone on to endure a mixed start to the new season and some of the 10 first-team players that were moved on during the summer transfer window have had similar fates away from Old Trafford.",
      "It's been a slow start to life at Stamford Bridge for Garnacho, who joined Chelsea in a £40million deal. He was handed his first start on Tuesday night against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup but it wasn't exactly a game which will live long in the memory: he failed to attempt a single dribble during his 59 minutes on the pitch and made little impact with the overall team display falling below par. To rub salt in his wounds, he was jeered all night by Lincoln fans and left the field to a rendition of \"You're f***ing s***\".",
      "Garnacho obviously has no shortage of talent and his lack of action over pre-season means an early exit against Lincoln was probably always on the cards. But taking into account his showing against League One opposition and his two other cameo appearances for the Blues to date, Garnacho hasn't caught light yet.",
      "Perhaps the most high-profile departure from United this summer, Rashford got the move he wanted when Barcelona came calling to take him on loan for the season. And to be fair to the England star, he's been able to show some of the reasons why the Spanish giants were so keen to land him, with his magnificent match-winning double against Newcastle in the Champions League undoubtedly the highlight of Rashford's spell at the Nou Camp so far.",
      "Unfortunately for Rashford, things took a sour turn at the weekend when he was dropped for turning up late to a training session. But he came off the bench to notch another assist, so the positives have far outweighed the negatives.",
      "Like Rashford, Antony had a specific destination in mind heading into the summer and re-joined Real Betis after a productive loan spell. The Brazilian winger dazzled in Spain and looked far more like the player United thought they were signed when they splashed north of £85m on him back in the summer of 2021.",
      "In terms of the current campaign, Antony has started both La Liga games for Betis so far this term but is yet to register a goal contribution.",
      "Hojlund reportedly didn't want to leave Manchester United but he's started all three of the games he's played for Napoli since joining the Italian champions on loan. He marked his Serie A debut with a goal which should give him a major confidence boost after regularly going long periods without scoring in a United shirt.",
      "After losing his spot in the team, Onana was offered the chance to kickstart his career in Turkey after a difficult period at Old Trafford. He didn't enjoy a perfect debut but he did make a decent impression and went on to notch an assist in his second Turkish Super Lig appearance.",
      "The Cameroon star is still waiting for his first clean sheet, but two games in and the early signs are promising for a player who will be desperate to rediscover his top form.",
      "Sancho joined Aston Villa on loan shortly before the transfer deadline. He has yet to make an impression at his new club, though, featuring for just eight minutes in the Premier League as a substitute. He did play 74 minutes against Brentford in the Carabao Cup second round, with Villa going out on penalties after a goalless draw.",
      "Like Sancho, Lindelof ended up making the move to Villa Park this summer after his contract at United expired. He too has hardly featured, with his sole appearance in a Villa shirt coming in a seven minute cameo against Everton in the Premier League.",
      "Eriksen has only just linked up with another club, signing for Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg. He has made just one substitute appearance for the club - 30 minutes in their recent 1-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund - but was criticised by former Denmark international, Thomas Gravesen, for training with Swedish side Malmo before joining his new club.",
      "United have high hopes for Collyer and in West Bromwich Albion the young midfielder has joined a team who are likely to be in the running for the Championship play-offs. He has featured in all five of the Baggies' league games to date but is yet to start for Ryan Mason's side, who are seventh in the table.",
      "Amass has linked up with crisis club Sheffield Wednesday and started both of their league games since leaving Old Trafford, albeit in a more advanced role on the left-hand side. Like Collyer, it's hoped that a season playing regularly in the Championship will be benificial for the talented youngster's development.",

The Frenchman is still waiting to make his debut for the Ligue 1 side after enduring a challenging three-year spell.",
      "The midfielder is on a mission to revive his career in France, following a series of injuries, a terminated contract with Juventus and an 18-month doping ban since his departure from Manchester United. His final season at Old Trafford in 2021/22 was marred by injuries, with his last appearance for the Red Devils ending prematurely during their 4-0 loss to Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "Pogba completed a free transfer back to Juventus at the end of the season, but his injury troubles persisted. He was later provisionally suspended from playing due to a failed drug test in September 2023.",
      "Juventus terminated Pogba's contract last November - despite him only making 12 appearances for the club - even though Pogba successfully appealed his four-year doping suspension after being found guilty of taking the banned substance DHEA.",
      "The ban was reduced to 18 months in October 2024, allowing him to start training and playing again from January 2025 and March 2025, respectively. Pogba had to wait until June to secure a new club, eventually signing a two-year contract with Monaco.",
      "\"Finally the nightmare is over. I can look forward to the day when I can follow my dreams again,\" Pogba said in a statement after his ban was reduced.",
      "\"I always stated that I never knowingly breached World Anti-Doping Agency regulations when I took a nutritional supplement prescribed to me by a doctor, which does not affect or enhance the performance of male athletes.",
      "\"I play with integrity and, although I must accept that this is a strict liability offence, I want to place on record my thanks to the Court of Arbitration for Sport's judges who heard my explanation.",
      "\"This has been a hugely distressing period in my life because everything I have worked so hard for has been put on hold.\"",
      "But he has yet to turn out for his team as he continues working toward match fitness and sharpness, having been absent from competitive action since September 2023, when he appeared from the substitutes' bench during Juventus' encounter with Empoli.",
      "Minamino is one player who has certainly left his mark on Pogba at the training ground since arriving at Monaco, with the France international confessing he must take a leaf out of the Japanese star's book.",
      "\"Takumi is always the first one to arrive at training and the last to leave,\" he told Sportiva. \"I've never seen a player so disciplined yet enjoying football so much at the same time.",
      "\"That's something I need to learn from him. When you watch him play, you can clearly see he's always thinking on the pitch.",
      "\"He's incredibly smart, and his movement shows just how deeply he understands the game.\"",
      "Minamino and Pogba never went head-to-head as rivals during their respective spells at Liverpool and Manchester United, with the Japanese left warming the bench on each of the three occasions the Reds locked horns with a Red Devils team featuring his current colleague.",
      "The attacker – who shone in patches for Liverpool – clocked up 55 appearances across two-and-a-half campaigns at Anfield, notching 14 goals and three assists as he helped Jurgen Klopp's squad claim the Premier League in 2020 and both the League Cup and FA Cup in 2022, with numerous supporters believing he was undervalued during his stint on Merseyside.",
      "Having transferred to Monaco in a preliminary £12.9million deal in June 2022, Minamino has since made 105 appearances for the Ligue 1 team, contributing 21 goals and 17 assists.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been warned he could have just months remaining as Manchester United boss, with Oliver Glasner being backed as his potential replacement. The Portuguese manager has faced mounting pressure in recent weeks following United's worst start to the season since 1992-93.",
      "Saturday's 2-1 victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford in the Premier League provided some relief as his squad delivered a determined display. However, former United goalkeeper Ben Foster reckons it's merely a question of when, not if, Amorim receives his P45 after claiming his side have failed to click this term.",
      "He's also endorsed Crystal Palace chief Glasner as his natural successor following the Eagles' excellent start to the campaign, despite losing several crucial stars during the summer transfer window.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper said: \"I think he [Amorim] has got a couple months left, probably. He'll go through a bad little run of two or three or four games in a row where he loses and eventually they'll go, 'Right, we've had enough now, it's obviously not working.'",
      "\"I just watch them, and I don't really see any kind of cohesion. Somebody who would be good for Man United is Glasner. He's only got nine months left on his contract at Palace. My only worry about it is that Man United are so sick and tired of playing three at the back.",
      "\"If they go and get Glasner and he goes, 'Right, I'm playing three at the back,' they'll go, 'Nah, come on mate. This isn't going to work.' For this guy to have lost five star players though and for Palace still look like they've got better. They're fifth in the league.\"",
      "Glasner featured amongst numerous candidates previously identified on a shortlist of potential replacements for Amorim should he be dismissed from his role. Betting companies also highlighted Andoni Iraola, Gareth Southgate, Marco Silva and Mauricio Pochettino amongst the other contenders.",
      "Amorim was recently linked with a return to Portugal to take charge of Benfica amidst the continuing speculation surrounding his future at United. Those rumours were quashed when former Red Devils manager Jose Mourinho accepted the role last Friday.",

      "The left-back never featured in a first-team match for the Red Devils and was sent on loan to Preston North End and Granada before a subsequent stint at Benfica rejuvenated his career. Following an impressive half-season in Portugal, Carreras joined them on a permanent deal in the summer of 2024 for €6m plus a potential €3m in add-ons (£7.8m).",
      "His maiden full campaign in Portugal turned out to be a success and Real decided to act swiftly and secured the full-back's services. Now returned to the Spanish capital, Carreras has been making his mark and Alonso cannot resist lauding the former United player.",

As for Patrick Dorgu, signed by Ruben Amorim as the first choice for the left flank, he is currently valued at £22million, the same as Noussair Mazraoui.

      "He had endured a difficult start to life in Catalunya with some members of the Spanish press claiming the European powerhouses were going to try and cancel his loan, reports which were soon rejected by the club. After his brace in their 2-1 away victory over Newcastle United in the Champions League, it looked as if Rashford was beginning to settle.",
      "Sancho, meanwhile, made his first Premier League appearance for Villa at the weekend. The duo have maintained their friendship from their time together at United and England, which have both had many difficult moments.",
      "Last season, Sancho stirred up controversy among United fans when he announced Rashford was now 'free' after moving to Villa on loan. Rashford's stint at Villa Park rejuvenated the 27-year-old and his performances were enough to convince Barcelona to take a chance on him this season.",
      "Villa did not take up the option to sign him permanently, meaning Rashford and Sancho found themselves in the so-called Red Devils' 'Bomb Squad' after being deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho could have made a permanent move to Chelsea at the end of last season, but he returned to Old Trafford after failing to agree on wages with Enzo Maresca's team. It's rumoured the ex-Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund player reached out to Rashford about a potential move to Villa, who offered a glowing endorsement.",
      "On Sunday, Sancho made his first appearance for Villa in the Premier League, but it didn't go as planned. Unai Emery's side couldn't overcome 10-man Sunderland at the Stadium of Light, drawing 1-1.",
      "Reflecting on the recent match, Sancho uploaded a photo of him playing for Villa with the caption: \"Unfortunate not to get the win over the weekend, head up and go again to make things right!\"",
      "Rashford was quick to show his support to his former team-mate, responding with a red heart emoji to the winger's message.",
      "While Sancho is finding his feet at Villa Park, Rashford is experiencing ups and downs of his own. His brace in his Champions League debut for the club was a huge statement, particularly with Lamine Yamal currently nursing an injury.",
      "He was then dropped for Barcelona's next match against Getafe by Hansi Flick after reporting late for a team meeting before the clash. He made up for his poor time-keeping by helping create their crucial third goal in a 3-0 victory.",
      "Rashford has two goals and one assist in six appearances for Barcelona. He will be eying even more when his side travel to face Oviedo in their next match on Thursday, before they play host to Real Sociedad on Sunday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have some time to rest ahead of their trip to Brentford at the weekend with no European or Carabao Cup action. It means Ruben Amorim will have a full week to prepare for the Premier League clash.",
      "United beat Chelsea last time out thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, with the latter also receiving a red card on the stroke of half-time.",
      "United could end up being referred to the Premier League for an investigation after Maguire decided to interfere with the multiball protocol after his substitution against Chelsea. Footage has emerged of the defender departing the Old Trafford pitch after being taken off, and kicking a ball off one of the cones to send it to rolling towards the home crowd.",
      "Technically, Maguire broke one of the Premier League rules by doing this, as the rules state that not interfering with the system is crucial to \"ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",
      "The rule also reads: \"Participants (including but not limited to players, substitutes, occupants of the technical area or any other club personnel) must not interfere with the multiball system, the match ball or the replacement balls at any time.",
      "\"Any failure to follow the multiball protocol will be referred to the Premier League for further investigation and possible regulatory action under the Premier League rules.\"",
      "It is unclear if the footage has been sent to the league's hierarchy or if Maguire has been spoken to.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has told Sesko to follow in Ruud van Nistelrooy's footsteps at United's training ground and storm off if he continues to receive poor service in front of goal.",
      "The Slovenian striker is yet to find the net for the Red Devils in the Premier League, making five appearances. Speaking on his Rio Presents podcast, the ex-United defender criticsed Sesko's performances, saying: \"In the first half, against 10 men, he's had six touches. Six touches! I think the responsibility goes to the striker as well [as other players].",
      "\"In today's game there's enough at your disposal technology-wise and clip-wise that you can get it in black and white on the iPad and say to your team-mates, 'You know when you got in that position, look where I am.'\"",
      "Ferdinand went on to highlight how Van Nistelrooy once stormed off the training pitch when he became frustrated with Cristiano Ronaldo's lack of service from the wings - much like Sesko could be feeling with Amad's current form out wide.",
      "He added: \"It's decision making in the final third that's going to set him free or it isn't, and he's got to try and dictate to a lot of those players either through runs that make it so obvious or physically telling them after a game.",
      "\"They're the type of conversations he has to have because I know Ruud [van Nistelrooy] was having that.",
      "\"I saw Ruud van Nistelrooy walk off the training field because Ronaldo did too many step overs and he wasn't playing it when he wanted it. You've got to find it from somewhere to make your team-mates know, and that will be the making of him.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Marcus Rashford is lighting it up in La Liga and the Champions League for Barcelona - and the Catalan giants may be tempted to make his loan move permanent.",
      "Currently, United value the forward at £35million and have no recall clause in his contract; meaning that the 27-year-old will spend his entire 2025/26 season in Spain if all goes well.",
      "However, Barca are hoping to make this loan switch a permanent one and believe they can secure the England international's services for just £26m. While Sir Jim Ratcliffe won't be keen to let Rashford leave on the cheap, the boyhood United fan doesn't see a way back at his old club even if he does well abroad.",
      "While Barcelona and United continue to hash out a potential permanent fee for the experienced attacker, Rashford will continue to let his football do the talking as he prepares for a big season and summer ahead.",
      "Matheus Cunha made a return to the United squad on Saturday against Chelsea, coming on as a substitution in the 64th minute for Noussair Mazraoui. However, there are few other injury returns on the way, with Lisandro Martinez remaining unavailable for Amorim.",
      "Diogo Dalot, on the other hand, had been sidelined with a muscle injury that has kept him ruled out for both United and Portugal. However, United confirmed on Tuesday that the defender has returned to training ahead of the clash with Brentford, and may be in contention to return to the matchday squad.",
      "Meanwhile, Martinez has been recovering from a knee injury that occurred last season, which forced the defender to undergo surgery in February.",
      "Since then, the centre-half has returned to training and is building up fitness ahead of a return to Amorim's line-up. No return date has been given at this time, although it looks like Martinez can't be far off of joining up with the rest of his teammates on matchday - even from the bench.",
      "Casemiro is now also unavailable for United, though it is through suspension rather than injury. The Brazilian was sent off during United's win over Chelsea, meaning he will miss the trip to Brentford at the weekend.",
      "He could return to the matchday squad for United's fixture against Sunderland early next month.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was booed by Lincoln City fans as he struggled to make an impression on his first start for Chelsea as they were given an almighty scare in the Carabao Cup by their League One opponents.",
      "Garnacho, 21, was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge all summer after being informed he had no future at Manchester United by Ruben Amorim towards the end of the 2024-25 campaign. He didn't become a Blue until late in the summer transfer window, though, swapping Manchester for London in a £40million switch.",
      "The Argentina international was handed his first Chelsea start by Enzo Maresca in Tuesday night's meeting with Lincoln after failing to come off the bench in the Blues' 2-1 loss away at United on Saturday - and he did not receive a warm welcome by the Imps, whose fans also serenaded him with a chant of \"You're f***ing s***\" when he was substituted on the hour mark.",
      "Prior to that, Garnacho's every touch was booed by home fans at the LNER Stadium as Lincoln fought to pull off one of the biggest cup shocks of the season. And as Garnacho struggled to make an impression in the first half, Lincoln hit the front through Rob Street following a defensive mix-up from the visitors.",
      "Some gleeful Manchester United fans revelled in seeing him fail to impress against League One opposition. One fan wrote on social media: \"Garnacho is being substituted against Lincoln. Yeah! We weren't the problem.\"",
      "Others were quick to point out the attacker had struggled to register a goal contribution in his three appearances for Chelsea so far, with plenty posting \"003\". Another fan wrote: This Garnacho downfall … lol. He made the worst decision joining Chelsea!\"",
      "Fortunately for Garnacho and Chelsea, they spared their blushes with a second half rally as quickfire goals from Tyrique George and Facundo Buonanotte helped turn the game on its head shortly before Garnacho was withdrawn.",
      "Garnacho's early withdrawal was likely due to his lack of action in pre-season for Manchester United after it became clear he would be leaving the club. The winger will be hoping to build on his first Blues start at the weekend when Chelsea host Brighton at Stamford Bridge.",

      "Complications from ankle surgery and the subsequent infection means Rangnick will now remain in hospital for an extended period. He initially underwent ankle surgery in June but was forced to undergo an emergency operation due to complications in July. His ankle issues saw him undergo another operation last week, with Bild saying Rangnick's infection is the 'serious reason' behind his extended stay in hospital.",
      "Johannes Gabel, an ankle specialist who has worked with some of Germany's top stars including Manuel Neuer and Jamal Musiala, will oversee Rangnick's further treatment.",

      "He is expected, though, to be back on the touchline for those games. Rangnick's assistant, Lars Kornetka, will now announce the squad for those games.",

Ruben Amorim's squad will be making the journey to London for the weekend's early kick-off, with their sights set on securing their first win at Brentford since January 2022.",
      "Those tuning in or attending the match will notice a slight change in United's appearance. For the first time this season, United will be donning their black third kit. Up until now, they've sported their red home shirt in all six competitive matches, with the white away kit only making an appearance during pre-season.",

      "\"Welcome to the home of the greatest football club in the world,\" said Alan Keegan.",
      "The voice of Old Trafford was on duty to introduce Manchester United's Under-21s on Wednesday night, and Stephen Torpey attended following the unveiling of his arrival from Brentford.",
      "United officially announced Torpey as the new head of the academy an hour before the game. Torpey previously worked with Jason Wilcox at Manchester City and the pair sat together in the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "Torpey has the credentials to work in the academy of the 'greatest football club in the world', having excelled during his time at City and Brentford, but he will do well to emulate Nick Cox, who will leave behind a wonderful legacy when he becomes Everton's technical director at the end of the week.",
      "Perhaps Torpey's first observation was that Ruben Amorim's formation is not used by Travis Binnion, which has been questioned by some fans who argue it makes sense to use 3-4-3 from top to bottom.",
      "Darren Fletcher has made a superb start to his time in charge of the U18s and also does not use Amorim's formation. The U21s and the U18s are top of their respective leagues.",
      "\"It's a collective approach to decide how the academy team is going to play, so it's not my choice,\" he said. \"There's conversations between myself, Jason Wilcox, the senior coaches within the academy in terms of Trav Binnion, Dave Hughes, Adam Lawrence and Colin Little.",
      "\"We talk about the type of football that our boys will need to experience to give them a well-rounded education, which is going to equip them for the game, not just to get them to the start line and for them to make a debut, but these boys will still be playing around 2045 and 2050.\"",
      "Could the youth teams change formation now Torpey has succeeded Cox? It's possible, but it would be a huge shock to change the youth team's systems during the campaign.",
      "The priority for Torpey will be attempting to ensure there is no disruption from Cox's departure. United's academy has arguably been the only area of the club that has functioned well in recent years.",
      "United's U21 manager Binnion has been a hugely important cog in the academy system over the last few years and he named an interesting team to face Bilbao, starting Chido Obi on the bench partly due to rotation and partly to see how he would handle being rested.",
      "The U21s secured a 2-1 victory over Liverpool last weekend and Binnion rotated accordingly, but United looked like what they were in the first half against Bilbao: a team without their best players on the pitch.",
      "It didn't take long for Bilbao to open the scoring through Asier Hierro. The young striker finished into the bottom right corner at the Stretford End with a brilliantly struck free-kick. The Spaniards went into the interval with a one-goal advantage, but they had created enough chances to be leading by three.",
      "It wasn't until Binnion made four changes on the hour mark that United were able to produce quality in the final third. Shea Lacey, Amir Ibragimov, Finley McAllister and Gabriele Biancheri were introduced for Jayce Fitzergald, Jim Thwaites, Victor Musa and Reece Munro, and the changes had the desired effect.",
      "Ibragimov came close to scoring within seconds of entering the pitch - and Biancheri picked up the ball down the right a few minutes later. The youngster skipped down the wing and created a tap-in for James Scanlon.",
      "Biancheri didn't stop there and scored in the last seconds of added time to seal a late comeback. The goal meant United made the perfect start to the Premier League International Cup's group stage.",
      "It remains to be seen how Torpey will impact the academy. But his presence at Old Trafford signalled the start of a new era and he would have liked what he saw.",

Prior to his January 2024 arrival at the west London club, he had led academy coaching across all groups at Manchester City, and at the foundation phase, with Liverpool.",
      "\"He began work at Carrington on Monday, and will attend the Under-21s’ exciting Premier League International Cup clash against Athletic Club at Old Trafford on Wednesday evening.",
      "\"Everyone at the club gives a warm welcome to Stephen and wishes him the best of luck in his new role.\"",
      "In June, it was confirmed that Cox was to leave the academy after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022.",
      "Torpey was previously at Manchester City, where he spent nine-and-a-half years in different positions, notably working closely alongside Jason Wilcox, director of football at United.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is determined to win his starting role back at Manchester United this season.",
      "It's understood Mainoo has even changed his private chef at home in an attempt to improve his game. The midfielder also worked with a private coach during the September international break.",
      "Mainoo is desperate to start regularly for United again after slipping down the pecking order.",
      "The 20-year-old wanted to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, but United did not entertain his request. The MEN have been told Mainoo did not want to leave his boyhood club permanently, and only wanted a loan for the sake of regular minutes in an important season.",
      "The youngster has reacted positively to the denial of his loan request and is focused on forcing his way into United's starting team so that he can represent England at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Mainoo started against Spain in the Euro 2024 final, but he was not included in England's squad for September's international fixtures. Thomas Tuchel explained that he needs minutes to feature in his plans.",
      "Representing England next summer is a huge motivation for Mainoo.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to fight for his place and he provided detailed thoughts on the youngster when he spoke at a press conference ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "\"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,\" said Amorim when asked whether he'd seen a difference in Mainoo. \"I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed - I did this week.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling. I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League so far this term. Amorim said: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",

      "They will now look to build on that when the team travel to take on Brentford on Saturday (12.30pm kick off). They will have to play the game without midfielder Casemiro who will serve a one-game suspension after being shown two yellow cards in the first half vs Chelsea.",
      "Away from on the pitch matters, while the transfer window may now be closed, that doesn't stop speculation about possible comings and goings when it re-opens in just a few months time. Planning will already be taking place ahead of the January window opening.",

      "But this is a step in the right direction for United's recruitment policy.",

      "Reports in Germany claim that a clause in the striker's contract means that he is available for a bargain price.",

He’s beginning to look the leader of this backline, and he probably goes under the radar at times. It feels like he’s been around forever but he’s still only 26 and should only get better.\""

      "The Brazilian has started both league games since completing his permanent move to Betis, and on Wednesday night, he scored his first goal against Ange Postecoglou's side.",

      "Sancho joined Antony in securing a move away from United 'bomb squad' in the summer, moving to Aston Villa on a season-long loan.

      "Manchester United formally announced Stephen Torpey as the head of the academy on Wednesday.",
      "In June, it was confirmed that Nick Cox was set to leave after nine years of service to become technical director at Everton. During his time in charge, Cox has played a pivotal role in United's academy's renaissance, securing top youth signings and overseeing an FA Youth Cup triumph in 2021/22.",
      "Torpey has big shoes to fill. He worked closely with Jason Wilcox at Manchester City and the pair sat together at Old Trafford to watch the Under-21s against Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday.",
      "United have hired Torpey from Brentford, where he worked as the academy director from January 2024. Brentford hired Torpey to essentially build their academy from scratch and deliver Category One academy status. Torpey was previously at City, where he spent nine-and-a-half years in different positions.",
      "Torpey joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between the Under-15 and Under-23 age groups, a role in which he oversaw trophy wins.",
      "The 43-year-old is credited with helping City implement a Barcelona-style coaching system, which has subsequently enabled the club's youth teams to win trophies with a similar style of football to their first-team.",
      "Torpey played a role in the development of Cole Palmer, James McAtee and Rico Lewis, who all progressed through the academy system at City to make senior debuts under Pep Guardiola. He also played a role in player recruitment as part of a team of academy staff who pitched to potential new signings.",
      "After a modest playing career, Torpey explored a career in coaching and returned to former club Liverpool. He was welcomed back to Merseyside as a Liverpool academy graduate, and worked in the youth system while it underwent a period of change, guided by the Spanish influence of Rafael Benitez.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with The Times, Torpey said: “When you see players walk out for the first team and you’ve worked with them from the very earliest ages, they feel like one of your own.",
      "“There’s no better feeling for a fan than to watch one of your own. I think that’s the challenge here: to try and create that same special feeling for our fans when they see one of our local players run out at the Gtech and play in the Premier League and represent the club that they love.”",
      "Torpey was born in Kirby in Merseyside. He began his playing career in Liverpool's academy and played for the likes of Prescot Cables, Altrincham and FC United of Manchester during a lengthy non-league career.",
      "The new United chief joined FC United in 2005 following the founding of the club as a protest against the Glazer family. Torpey scored the club's first goal in a friendly match against Flixton in August 2005.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly very close to completing a transfer for 17-year-old Senegalese midfielder Mouhamed Dabo.",
      "According to Africa Foot, Dabo has been on trial at Carrington in recent times as United continue to broaden their scout network for the next generation of players. The central midfielder, who is also the captain of the Senegal U17s national team, is thought to have impressed the United decision makers during a trial.",
      "Currently, Dabo is on the books at the Be Sport Academy who have had ties to Barcelona in the past. And while it is claimed that the midfielder is on the radar of the Catalan club, it is thought that United are on the verge of completing the deal.",
      "Interestingly, it is believed that Dabo's 'raw talent and maturity' have convinced the recruitment team to take a punt on the Senegalese player. Should United complete the deal, it is likely that they would pay a 'minimal fee' for Dabo that could be paid back at least ten fold if he manages to progress into the first-team.",
      "While Dabo would almost certainly enter the academy at United, it is yet more evidence of the Reds looking to the future with their recruitment policy. Previously, Ineos have spoken with fondness at the idea of signing players at a young age and developing them into stars of the future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Speaking at The Times CEO Summit in June 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe made a point of insisting that signing household names alone would not take United back to the top. \"I don't think the solution is to buy a [Kylian] Mbappe,\" he explained.",
      "\"We are more grassroots than that. One player is not going to solve the problem at Manchester United.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is build a balanced squad and ultimately maybe top it off with one or two players like Mbappe. It will take two or three summer windows to get to a better place.\"",
      "So far, Ineos have had two full summer transfer windows since Ratcliffe's comments and the jury remains out on the recruitment they have managed to complete. United return to action on Saturday when they visit Brentford in the Premier League.",

      "Marc Overmars believes Royal Antwerp pulled off some 10 out of 10 transfer business by completing the sale of Senne Lammens to Manchester United.",
      "The Belgian side's technical director reckons his team produced some phenomenal business by earning healthy fees for the goalkeeper and Mahamadou Doumbia during the summer transfer window.",
      "United paid £18million for Lammens services after an unconvincing start to the season for goalkeepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana — the latter eventually moved on loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "Lammens, 23, has yet to feature for Ruben Amorim's side, only being good enough for a place among the substitutes against Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "And former Arsenal star Overmars believes his side have pulled off some fantastic work despite losing their first choice shotstopper on transfer deadline day.",
      "\"If you have zero euros to spend in the past two seasons and from that point of view you raise 45 million euros, then you get a 10 in the business world,\" Overmars told Het Laatste Nieuws.",
      "\"Value for money , that's what it's called. We got Senne for zero euros and Doumbia for four hundred thousand. That's different from investing 18 million and hoping for something to come out of it. We've been creative.\"",
      "According to Overmars, the healthy profit Antwerp earned was not always set to come from United, as the Dutchman revealed Lammens was not destined for Old Trafford at the beginning of the final day of the window.",
      "\"When Manchester United wanted Senne Lammens, we said; 'Listen, we're not Brighton or Brentford, with whom you have to negotiate for weeks'. With us, things have to move quickly,\" Overmars said.",
      "\"With Manchester United, we started as losers on deadline day. We had a deal with Aston Villa, but Martinez still had to leave and Senne didn't want to go there. Only then did Man United make a first offer. Lower than Aston Villa. Four hours later, we finally reached an agreement.\"",
      "Asked earlier this month whether Bayindir was the new United No.1 over Lammens, Amorim said: \"No, nobody has a place that is his place. Everyone has to fight. Everyone is fighting for a place.",
      "\"I'm just trying to win games, trying to see what is the best option to win the next game.",
      "\"So, in the end of the season, maybe it's a different team on the pitch. We are all just trying to win games. Trying to get the best connections to play better and, in the end, to win points.\"",

The club's legendary striker was set to pen fresh terms in 2010 but demanded answers about the club's ambitions after watching fellow attackers Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez both depart Old Trafford.",
      "United had surrendered the league crown to Chelsea and Rooney was desperate to discover who they were bringing in. Ferguson took a dim view of having his judgement challenged and the duo clashed, prompting Rooney to hand in a transfer request.",
      "The drama unfolded over just days before the Evertonian committed to a fresh deal. Yet reflecting on events, Rooney insists his fears were eventually vindicated.",
      "The Manchester giants claimed the Premier League in 2011 and 2013, but with an elderly squad lacking the world-class quality of previous eras. Fast forward to today and Rooney maintains no explanation has ever been provided regarding the club's strategy.",
      "He said on Rio Meets Wayne: \"I think that question I asked then, in 2010, it still hasn't been answered, been addressed, from 2010. And I think fans have seen... I don't think, if fans look back, they'd be like, you know what, he actually seen what was coming a little bit. And I don't think it's been fixed since 2010.\"",
      "Manchester United have struggled to mount a serious title challenge since their last Premier League triumph in 2013, despite the efforts of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal. Both managers were tasked with rejuvenating an ageing squad, but despite significant investment, recruitment has been problematic. Wayne Rooney maintains that his concerns raised in 2010 were valid.",
      "He reflected: \"Well, if I look back to 2010, I don't think it has. I don't think, we obviously won the league in 2013, but lots changed, obviously. Commercially, social media, everything changed. But I still think when we lost Ronaldo and Tevez, from that moment, we got Robin in, obviously, for a couple years.",
      "\"But from that moment the club has never had a group of forwards who... Look, before my time, with Teddy, with Solskjaer, Coley, Yorkie. Then you've got me, Ronaldo, Tevez, Berbatov, Saha. From that moment, the club has never had a group of forwards who can all play and come win you games. And that is Man United.\"",
      "Rooney concedes that, in retrospect, challenging Sir Alex Ferguson may not have been the best decision, but he insists: \"I still think I had a right to ask the question.\"",

      "Manchester United's Kobbie Mainoo is still considering a move away from his boyhood club in an effort to keep his World Cup aspirations alive.",
      "This desire could potentially result in a loan deal during the upcoming transfer window, should his situation at Old Trafford not improve, as reported by the Daily Star. Mainoo has found himself increasingly frustrated at United, having struggled to secure regular starts under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The midfielder's career appears to have stalled over the past year. Despite starting for England in their Euro 2024 final against Spain in Berlin last summer, Mainoo has been overlooked since Thomas Tuchel took over from Gareth Southgate.",
      "He has also found himself sidelined at club level. The 20-year-old has only made four appearances this season and started just one match, United's embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby.",
      "Mainoo attempted to leave United during the summer transfer window, but his request for a loan move was denied by the club's management. He accepted the decision and has been working hard to regain favour with Amorim.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, despite United's disappointing start to the new season, Mainoo has found that little has changed. Amorim held private discussions with Mainoo last week, reassuring him that he remains part of his plans while challenging him to fight harder for his place in the squad.",
      "Tuchel has made it clear that he won't consider including Mainoo in his Three Lions squad until the player secures more pitch time. With this in mind, Mainoo has come to terms with the fact that he may need to seek another loan move in January if he remains on the periphery of Amorim's team.",
      "With the World Cup in North America looming next summer, Mainoo is eager to secure a spot on Tuchel's squad. He recognises that this won't be possible if he continues to be sidelined at United.",

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Harry Maguire has leapt to the defence of Luke Shaw after he came underfire from Roy Keane following the defeat to Manchester City earlier this month. United were underwhelming in the Manchester derby, losing 3-0 to their fierce rivals. And, unsurprisingly after such a heavy loss, the critics were out in force to pick apart the Reds' failings.",
      "One man who caught particular criticism from Keane was Shaw. The former United captain insisted the full-back, who is currently being utilised in a three-man defence, 'gave up' allowing Phil Foden to score. Addressing those criticisms after defeating Chelsea a week later, Shaw admitted: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin.",

      "In an interview with United's official club website after surpassing 250 appearances for the club, Maguire defended Shaw.",
      "\"You don’t play at this club 250 or 300 times if you’re first and foremost not a good player,\" the centre-back explained.",
      "\"Luke’s an excellent footballer, and every manager that comes in, he gets questioned a lot. That’s what happens at this club.",

      "Carreras was on the books at Old Trafford from 2020 until 2024 after being picked up by United's academy from Real Madrid. However, the Spaniard was not given much of a chance to impress in the first-team.",
      "The left-back never made a senior appearance for the Reds and was loaned to Preston North End and Granada before an eventual spell at Benfica revitalised his career. After enjoying half a season in Portugal, Carreras signed permanently with them in the summer of 2024.",
      "His only full season in Portugal proved to be a hit and Real chose to strike while the iron was hot and snapped the full-back up. Now back in the Spanish capital, Carreras has been impressing and Alonso cannot help but praise the former United man.",
      "\"I was optimistic [about his signing],\" Alonso told the media on Monday. \"His personality and competitive nature have pleasantly surprised me.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He makes very few mistakes, he is very focused, he has great mental quality, great tactical and technical quality too, he is very complete. The instant impact he has had is surprising, it is fantastic news.",
      "\"We also have Fran [Garcia] and Ferland [Mendy] for that position, but his performance is excellent.\" Carreras has not missed a minute in La Liga for Los Blancos this season and that form has led to his value sky-rocketing.",
      "According to transfermarkt, Carreras has a market value of £30.5m after being snapped up for £43m in the summer by Real. United full-back Diogo Dalot meanwhile, who has been an ever-present at Old Trafford and has been utilised at both right and left wing-back prior to his injury, is only worth £26m in the current market.",
      "As for Patrick Dorgu, who was signed by Ruben Amorim to be the first choice on the left flank, he has a current market value of £21.8m. After Carreras signed for Real in the summer, United did manage to bank an extra £7.5m thanks to their sell-on clause but they may well come to regret selling him.",

      "It's a similar move to what Arsenal had to do when they travelled to Athletic Club in the Champions League last week. The Gunners' away kit contains dark blue and back with the shorts and socks the same colour, but they were forced to wear white socks and shorts due to them clashing with Athletic's home strip.",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has sent his support to Jadon Sancho after the winger made his Premier League debut for Aston Villa on Sunday at Sunderland.",
      "Both Rashford and Sancho have been good friends since their time together with both United and England. The latter landed himself in hot water with the Reds' fanbase last season when he declared that Rashford was now 'free' after joining Villa on loan.",
      "The spell at Villa Park managed to revitalise Rashford and managed to earn him a season-long loan to Barcelona this season. At the beginning of the summer, the duo informed the Reds that they wished to leave the club.",
      "Sancho had been expected to join Chelsea permanently at the end of last season but he was returned to Old Trafford after failing to reach an agreement with Enzo Maresca's side on his wage. It has been claimed that the former Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund man contacted Rashford to discuss moving to Villa.",
      "Rashford is thought to have given the West Midlands club a glowing recommendation and the deal was completed at the start of this month. On Sunday, Sancho made his first appearance for Villa in the Premier League but it did not go according to plan as Unai Emery's side failed to beat 10-man Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reflecting on the fixture on Tuesday afternoon, Sancho wrote: \"Unfortunate not to get the win over the weekend, head up and go again to make things right!\" Rashford was quick to send his support to his former teammate, replying with a red heart emoji to the winger's message.",
      "Sancho will be hoping to receive further minutes for Villa on Thursday night when his new team host Bologna in their opening Europa League fixture of the season.",

      "Christian Eriksen believes former Manchester United players can be too critical in the media.",
      "Eriksen said goodbye to Old Trafford on the final day of last season. He wrote a farewell post on social media to thank United fans for their support during his three seasons at the club.",
      "The creative midfielder won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in Manchester. Eriksen's contract with United officially expired at the end of July and he signed for German club Wolfsburg on a free transfer.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Eriksen reflected on his time at the club and suggested recent trophy wins have been underappreciated because of United's successful history.",
      "Eriksen said: \"It probably depends who you ask. If you ask a fan, they want to be back to winning the league every year for the next 20 years like they did... this time of football it is almost impossible, to do that with so many other clubs having that many good players around. It's tough.",
      "\"I think obviously they want to get back to that to being stable as a top club, but even being there, winning the FA Cup and the Carabao in the last two seasons is something that any other club would be proud to have done.",
      "\"Then there is also the size and the image and the feeling at United - it's like it's not good enough. I think hopefully that will change. Even the Carabao [Cup] is a small thing, but at that moment it is a big thing.\"",
      "When asked about whether the opinion of ex-players has an impact on United, Eriksen said: \"You see how big the club is, how much people want to be involved with the club, even on the media attention. I think even now we speak about United here. It's just the power of the club.",
      "\"Obviously the more opinionated, the more feelings towards the club are negative, the tougher it is, because the fans follow their heroes on the TV and it doesn't help the players at the club.",
      "\"At the same time at United, as a footballer, there's always someone who has an opinion on one or the other, but you're just playing football. You try to focus on that bit, and I think United were good at that. The focus was on the game itself and not so much what people say.\"",
      "Roy Keane criticised Luke Shaw after the Manchester derby, claiming he \"gave up\" for Phil Foden's opening goal before suggesting the defender \"has been getting away with murder for years.\".",
      "Speaking after the Chelsea win, Shaw responded: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin. He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it but I think he was right.",
      "\"Last week, I wasn’t at my level at all and I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me. After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts. The most important thing is knowing how good I can be and I think the manager knows that and the managers who I played under in the past know that.",
      "\"I’m always in the team, I’m always playing, so there must be something the managers [see and] must believe in me. I’m not getting any younger and I need to be consistent, I’ve had lots of ups and downs and it’s about keeping that consistently high level because I know I can do that.",
      "\"And that’s why last week hurt me a lot because I know that’s not my level and I think the criticism is completely understandable, I take it on the chin and listen to it and I move on.\"",

      "The Reds have somehow won all their five Premier League games without ever playing particularly well, which should be pretty frightening to their supposed title rivals.",
      "Obviously, Liverpool have benefited from some excellent finishing; they have outscored their xG by almost four goals.",
      "Now you might reasonably ask what XPts are.",
      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",
      "In a basic approach, xPts is calculated by simulating each shot in a match.",
      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",
      "So basically, it’s running the game through algorithms and working out the average of how many points should have been garnered from each match according to the xG created and the xG conceded.",
      "As Johns says: ‘The stat does well at giving us a decent idea of how many points a team should get on average, especially over a season.’",
      "Over the first five Premier League games, there is a shock name at the top of the Premier League xPts table, as calculated by Understat.",
      "Bournemouth have not created the highest xG this season (that is somehow Manchester United) nor conceded the least xG (that is the miserly Newcastle United) but their xPts across those five games have been calculated as 9.98. They are closely followed by the equally impressive Crystal Palace.",
      "According to the same statistics, the worst three Premier League teams this season have been Wolves, Aston Villa and Burnley, so there is some small comfort for West Ham in those underlying stats.",
      "1) Bournemouth\n2) Crystal Palace\n3) Arsenal\n4) Manchester City\n5) Manchester United\n6) Newcastle United\n7) Chelsea\n8) Liverpool\n9) Everton\n10) Brighton\n11) Tottenham\n12) Brentford\n13) Fulham\n14) Sunderland\n15) Leeds United\n16) West Ham\n17) Nottingham Forest\n18) Wolves\n19) Aston Villa\n20) Burnley",
      "Arsenal now look like a team without ego, and we should all congratulate Mikel Arteta for carrying that burden of arrogance. The man is desperate for recognition.",
      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £400m and have ended up with a Like A New Signing upstaging them all, while Carabao chances were taken at Brighton and Chelsea.",
      "It doesn’t feel like Alexander actual Isak needed a head start in his battle for minutes at Liverpool but his ‘needless and stupid’ rival is awful generous.",
      "Everyone’s having a lot of fun with Hugo Ekitike’s ‘stupid’ red card, while there’s some sad news about a different kind of red for Cole Palmer.",
      "Scoring a tap-in against Southampton in the League Cup is the same as a last-minute winner at the Bernabeu right?"

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are ‘notably unhappy’ with the ‘frustration’ over Ruben Amorim’s contentious system and philosophy at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out but there are still widespread concerns over his 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford, and ahead of that win it was claimed he was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’, with ‘senior players’ questioning his tactics.",
      "Ratcliffe was at Carrington to meet with Amorim ahead of Sunday’s game, with Amorim joking that he was there to offer him a new deal.",
      "“New contract, he was offering me a new contract,” Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe’s visit.",
      "“No, it’s normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it’s a long project. He said many times, ‘This is my third season.’ For me, it’s not. But normal things.",
      "“I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.”",
      "And TBR Football’s chief correspondent Graeme Bailey has revealed more details on that meeting between Ratcliffe and Amorim, claiming United chief is “happy” with the summer transfer window and recognises an improvement in the team.",
      "Bailey said: “They’re happy with what’s happened over the summer – the players brought in, the system he’s implementing — and the main focus is seeing progress on the field.",
      "“And we are already seeing it: they’re a much better team than when he first took over, though admittedly they couldn’t have been much worse.",
      "“The club is backing Amorim. Jason Wilcox has fully bought into his approach, and the squad is being shaped in Amorim’s image. There’s little point in cancelling the experiment now — that would set the club back even further.”",
      "But the report adds that ‘Ratcliffe and his lieutenants are notably unhappy with the number of leaks around players voicing their frustration with Amorim’s system’.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave an update on Wednesday, from what he’s heard, on Amorim’s future at Man Utd.",
      "He said: “There is certainly appreciation for names like Oliver Glasner, but the sign that Amorim is still being backed is that there has been no outreach yet. There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",
      "“Manchester United still want to try and make it work with Ruben Amorim. That’s why he is likely to get a few more games, at least, before some of these other names perhaps come a bit more seriously to the fore if results don’t go according to plan for Amorim.”",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has thrown his hat into the ring for any future Man Utd job openings amid pressure on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ruben Amorim “has got a couple of months left” at Man Utd, according to Ben Foster, but one of his likely replacements has a big “worry” hanging over him.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Premier League Sack Race. But who will be next? Not much cover for Ruben Amorim now…",

      "Manchester United are apparently now ‘leading the race for a No.6’ that they should have entered in the summer transfer window and almost certainly won’t win at the end of this season.",
      "The Red Devils opted to spend their cash this summer on an all-new forward line and a backup goalkeeper, with a late push for Carlos Baleba more of a nudge before a weird reported baulk at a £100m price tag slapped on a midfielder who was always going to be valued at that mark by Brighton.",
      "The United performances this season, featuring an inept Manuel Ugarte and a foolhardy Casemiro over wantaway Kobbie Mainoo in the double pivot with Bruno Fernandes have confirmed a need that seemingly everyone but the Manchester United decision-makers viewed as either priority one, two or three over the summer.",
      "‘Manchester United are ready to lead the way next summer in the race for No 6 midfielders with the key position expected to dominate the transfer market,’ The Telegraph claimed on Wednesday, before revealing later in the report precisely why the Red Devils won’t be leading that race.",
      "The lure of Big Club history may have been enough to persuade Bryan Mbeumo to snub Newcastle for Manchester United, but that will surely prove to be no match against modern-day behemoth Manchester City in the transfer stakes next summer.",
      "It’s claimed ‘Manchester City could look at that position to ease the workload of 2024 Ballon d’Or winner Rodri’ in a possibility we can’t imagine Nico Gonzalez will be too fond of as he works to prove himself as a serviceable backup to his Spanish compatriot.",
      "While reports suggest United will reopen talks with Brighton over Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are also on the Red Devils’ shortlist, but in an increasingly unimaginative transfer market in which top clubs chase the same players, placing particular value on homegrown talents like Anderson or Wharton, we can also assume they’re on City’s.",
      "And we wonder whether Liverpool’s likely push for Wharton as a backup for Ryan Gravenberch, having been linked with the Palace midfielder in the summer amid their apparent bid to provide Arne Slot with two brilliant footballers to choose between in every position, may in fact bring about a situation where United have to settle for current top target Baleba.",
      "As Fabian Hurzeler said at the weekend, Baleba is “not a machine” and there is a “responsibility” for Brighton to help him rediscover his form having had his head turned by United to such a degree that he doesn’t look worth the £23.5m the Seagulls paid for him in the summer of 2023, let alone the nine-figure sum they’re now asking for.",
      "A similar trajectory which saw Evan Ferguson fade into anonymity having been linked with a big-money move to United would presumably lead even the hive-minders at Old Trafford to plump for one of the two alternatives, but interest from City and Liverpool in those same players would surely result in United finishing last in a race they’re currently leading.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "A new report claims Manchester United could sign an ‘elite’ player for *only* £60m in January, though this is utter nonsense…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’."

You’re not going to play— you might be on the bench— but just to take that pressure off you. And if you’re not scoring. So it’s… I honestly don’t think it’s been addressed, since then.”",

      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",

      "Send your mails to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "I understand why F365 thinks that Scholes has a Marcus Rashford problem.",
      "Because if you haven’t put yourself through each and every rubbish match they have played over the last 4-5 years, and then check that Rashford does play a few games a season quite well, you will wonder why Rashford is being targeted. But as someone who really really liked Marcus Rashford, and has put himself through each and every minute of each and every game since 10-15 years now, let me tell you why Scholes is just saying what every fan feels.",
      "Marcus is a local lad, who burst through and gave United fans hope that this is the next Academy player to be a star. He had great talent, was an amazing human and had the right values. So when he walks around the field for 80% of the match, literally not putting 2 steps to the right to try and defend or even fake defend when United don’t have the ball, and is one of the laziest players I’ve seen to grace the pitch, right up there with Martial and the 40 year old Ronaldo playing for Portugal currently. And while the Ronaldo case is easier to understand and the rest of the team work 10% harder to accommodate him at the age of 40, there is absolutely no reason the rest of the United team should suffer because Marcus cannot be bothered to do a proper job.",
      "On the edge of his own box, with the ball in front of him, he will just walk around and let the opposition players take shots or walk past him with ease. In EACH AND EVERY MATCH. It’s extremely annoying to watch regularly.",
      "Twice or thrice a season, he will put in a performance where he is energetic, runs with and without the ball, and his decision making is on point. But the rest of the time, he is one of the most lazy, infuriating and abysmal players on the pitch. Then comes his off-pitch behavior of being late, going partying, not working with the team agenda in mind, when he was the poster boy for Manchester United, it all mixes together to bring a feeling of sadness and regret at what he could have been and what he has become. The massive wages United gave him play a part in this downfall and for that I blame the management and board.",
      "The only reason I am excited for Rashford scoring or playing well for Barca is so United can scam 30 million pounds off for him, which no one in their right minds would otherwise pay along with his stupid wages. May he excel at Barca and find his peace there. I genuinely wish him well, and unlike Scholes I am happy for him if he finds a home in the beautiful city of Barcelona.\nAman",

      "Which demonstrates that the manager sets the required culture (standards), the players have to fall in line and if they don’t the manager needs to be backed by senior leaders to enforce the required standards. This starts with disciplining the players and if they continue to misbehave they need to be removed from the team and the club. This has what has clearly happened at Arsenal.",
      "At Utd both Ten Hag and Amorim have set standards. They started by disciplining players (dropping them/fining them) then moved to excluding them and then selling them. This was clearly backed by senior leadership who allowed multi million pound assets to lose value by excluding them from the first team.",
      "Therefore the managers and senior leadership have done their jobs in maintaining culture and standards.",
      "In conclusion what is left are the players that did not uphold Utd’s standards and culture. And although it could be argued that what they are paid is irrelevant, my argument would be that a) employees earning 25k a year are expected to adhere to company standards b) chief executives earning 10m a year are expected to adhere to company standards. Therefore people earning 15m a year certainly should be.",

      "In the 2024/25 season, Liverpool had two dedicated number 9s (Nunez and Jota) with four other senior players capable of ‘doing a job’ to varying degrees (Chiesa, Diaz, Gakpo and Salah). In 2025/26 this became Isak and Ekitike, and Chiesa, Gakpo and Salah.",
      "There was literally zero prospect of a team trying to go through an entire season with just one recognised striker, so two were always going to be necessary. The fact that one of these unexpectedly turned out to be Isak may have pushed Ekitike from an expected starting role to backup, but doesn’t change the fundamental fact that he was always going to be competing with someone for his place. He was likely made aware of this when he signed.",
      "After a great start to his Liverpool career, getting himself sent off in some of the dumbest circumstances possible will have undoubtedly not helped him retain his starting position over Isak, but that has probably only accelerated the inevitable.",
      "However, with the number of games that Liverpool are likely to play and Isak’s lack of pre-season and slightly patchy injury record, Ekitike will still get plenty of starts and substitute appearances. It therefore seems unlikely that the times he spends on the bench will result in significant surprise or unhappiness on his part despite what the media and certain people BTL would have you believe.\nMatt D, London",

Ekitike was born in 2002, so for his entire football playing life, he’s known he’ll be booked if he does that.",
      "As Hesh points out, it’s a “nonsense” rule given how ultimately harmless the act is, and how unaffected the other team are by it.",
      "However, the act itself is equally as daft as the rule. Maybe it’s just me. I’ve never understood the logical connection between scoring and taking your shirt off. It’s probably the most prominent thing that doesn’t make sense outside of a football context, but even in a football context, it’s something people used to do and I’m not convinced many of them really knew why, beyond it being something lots of other people did at the time.\nEd Quoththeraven",

After the game, the coach of Brighton, Fabian Hurzeler, was very honest. He said that when a young player like Baleba is linked to a team like Man Utd and the deal doesn’t happen, this can have an influence on his performance. It can have an impact.",
      "“Baleba wanted to go to Man Utd. But he’s always been respectful with Brighton. He was keen on the move. Personal terms were never going to be an issue. The problem was only Brighton and Man Utd. Brighton might consider let him go in 2026 but in 2025 it was always a no. That situation effected the player.",

      "Paul Scholes knows the unique pressures of Manchester United – and the possible ‘mistakes’ – better than anyone. So what’s his Marcus Rashford problem?",
      "It won’t have surprised Marcus Rashford that moving to another country has failed to extract him from the Manchester United orbit, nor perhaps how strong opinions toward him remain.",
      "But it would be interesting to hear his thoughts on Paul Scholes openly and happily explaining how “I really struggle to feel happy for him” after Rashford kickstarted his Barcelona career this past week.",
      "That is a remarkable admission, an insight which reveals far more uncomfortable truths about the personality of the pundit than it does the character of the player.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude, and his attitude at United by the time he was leaving,” Scholes continued, obviously on a podcast, obviously with Nicky Butt and Paddy McGuiness.",
      "“I thought he was a disgrace at United, and not trying, which look, if you fall out with the manager then okay. But remember, you’ve got teammates you’re playing with, you’ve got a massive 80,000 there, whatever it is every single week that you have to put a bit of effort in for.",
      "“The amount of times I saw him at Man United walking, because he wants to leave…I thought his whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.”",
      "The diatribe went on with shots at his work-rate against Newcastle – in a game he decided with two excellent goals – and culminated in a rant about Rashford being dropped for Barcelona’s next game after turning up late to a pre-match meeting.",
      "“What the f**k? How do you sleep in these days?” an increasingly incredulous Scholes asked, despite it long since having been reported that Rashford had been two minutes late because of a delay in filling out an electronic form, that he didn’t miss any of the pre-match preparations and indeed that he set up the third goal in a win over Valencia from the bench.",
      "A repeat of his past indiscretion under Erik ten Hag this was not.",
      "But that is the sort of fabrication one can only expect from a professional pundit who “really struggles to feel happy for” someone whose sacrifices and shortcomings he really should almost uniquely understand.",
      "Scholes has an important platform and authoritative voice, but also an obligation to use those properly in an arena as highly charged as that of Manchester United. If he cannot relate to and explain the pressures a professional footballer faces at the elite level and the misjudgements that can sometimes force them to make, that reflects abysmally on him rather than Rashford.",
      "The line about how Rashford “actually quit on Manchester United, and once you quit once, you’ll quit again” stood out too, as did the references to his age no longer being a defence of his actions.",
      "And at 27 that is absolutely fair. Rashford should know better than many of the decisions he made towards the ostensible end of his Manchester United career suggested.",
      "He might also justifiably point out he could have “quit on Manchester United” far sooner instead of playing through the pain of back, shoulder and foot injuries to be the most-used player by Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and second for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But a 26-year-old Scholes would have been grateful not to face this constant level of withering censure and scrutiny when he made what has since been described as his biggest career regret.",
      "“I made a mistake,” Scholes has said of a moment his “head had just gone” in November 2001. “I did stupid things when I was a kid, when I was younger,” he added of refusing to play in a League Cup tie against Arsenal 24 hours after only getting 13 minutes from the bench in a defeat to Liverpool.",
      "Except he was no more “a kid” then than Rashford is now, no less responsible for his choices and actions. Scholes was fined two weeks’ wages, much as Rashford was during his infamous Belfast-based indiscretion at precisely the same age around 18 months ago.",
      "The difference is less in the players and far more in the club and its corroded culture. Manchester United in 2001 is the diametric opposite to Manchester United in 2025. The former was defined by the support network and sensational man-management of Sir Alex Ferguson; the latter protects nothing and no-one, exposing all it touches to toxicity and self-destruction.",
      "It is what Scholes and the rest of the “circle of Ferguson” so often overlook or take for granted. Their ludicrous talent aligned perfectly with the reign of a genius manager and elite structure which encouraged individual development and offered an environment in which players were protected. They speak from a position of immense ability and vast experience but also absurd fortune.",
      "Had this infernal brand of omnipresent Manchester United player-turned-pundit arrived a generation or two later, been saddled with hierarchical incompetence and intermittent coaching upheaval throughout their careers and had Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and Bill Foulkes seeking out every microphone ever manufactured to actively undermine and denigrate them at any opportunity, they too might have found it tough and ultimately decided that leaving was in the best interests of all parties.",
      "Rashford did so in the knowledge that bridges had been burned on both sides, not just his. He won’t have expected a pat on the back and a pledge of lifelong support from the fans in doing so, but it also feels entirely ridiculous for one of his presumed heroes to brand him a “disgrace” who he “really struggles to feel happy for” 10 months after his last appearance for a broken club he tried to carry as far as he could.",
      "Florian Wirtz and Benjamin Sesko are most at risk of being cast in one of the early season’s most embarrassing and undesirable modern roles.",
      "Liverpool’s performances this season have only been good enough for eighth place in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal now look like a team without ego, and we should all congratulate Mikel Arteta for carrying that burden of arrogance. The man is desperate for recognition.",
      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £400m and have ended up with a Like A New Signing upstaging them all, while Carabao chances were taken at Brighton and Chelsea.",
      "It doesn’t feel like Alexander actual Isak needed a head start in his battle for minutes at Liverpool but his ‘needless and stupid’ rival is awful generous."

      "He has scored an extraordinary 98 goals in 103 matches for the German giants and has started this season in terrific form, registering 13 goals and three assists in seven appearances, including a brace against Chelsea in the Champions League last week.",
      "The 32-year-old will hit a century of goals for Bayern in only 104 games with a brace on Friday against Werder Bremen, which would make him the fastest player in Europe’s top-five leagues to reach that milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland both reached 100 goals in 105 games for Real Madrid and Manchester City, respectively.",
      "READ: Six left-field predictions of players who could win the 2026 Ballon d’Or",
      "Kane has been Bayern’s best and most consistent player since joining for around £100million, and they are reportedly in danger of losing him in the 2026 summer transfer window.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, there is an ‘exit clause in his contract’ worth €65million (£56.8m), though he would have to ‘announce his move in the winter’.",
      "That fee for a 33-year-old represents ‘a lot of money’ but also ‘could be dangerous for Bayern’, the report states.",
      "However, that ‘doesn’t even buy half the price of Alexander Isak’ and even if Kane stays in Germany until he’s 36, ‘a model professional like him would still be tearing the Bundesliga to pieces’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "Kane is said to still be keen to break the Premier League goalscoring record. It’s currently held by Alan Shearer with 260 goals. He himself has 213, all of which he’s scored for Tottenham. Should he return to his homeland in the summer after the 2026 World Cup, at the age of 33, he would have a prime chance of breaking the record.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann recently said Kane has a clause in his contract allowing him to leave next summer and backed Manchester United to sign him.",
      "He Adventure Gamers: “I think Harry Kane has a clause that allows him to leave for a certain amount next summer. I believe the reason Bayern Munich wanted to bring Nick Woltemade in this summer was because many within the club think Kane wants to go back to England after the World Cup.",
      "“I can see Harry Kane at Manchester United next season, and I think he’d do well for them,” Hamann added.",
      "“Having said that, I always felt that as a London boy, sometimes they don’t really like to go to the north. Having played for Spurs, obviously Chelsea and Arsenal might be tricky, but then again, you never know, if they give him a chance to win the Premier League.",
      "“I always felt or thought that a London club would be more favourable than a northern club, but obviously United is probably still the biggest club in England, and if they were to ask for his services, I think it would be fantastic to see him as their number nine.”",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "Marcus Rashford winning the Ballon d’Or would be the most Manchester United banter era thing to ever happen.",
      "It’s that time of year again when we all question if we are watching the same game as the people who vote for the Ballon d’Or.",

      "Manchester United will reportedly push to sign Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which is bad news for Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side targeted Baleba towards the end of the summer transfer window but showed no desire to meet Brighton’s £100million asking price after making an enquiry.",
      "The head coach was still strongly backed in the summer, with Man Utd spending over £200m on new signings, most notably revamping their attack with the additions of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After spending big, the Red Devils turned their attention to outgoings in the final weeks of the window.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho both left on deadline day, but one player who stayed put despite speculation was Mainoo.",
      "READ: Man Utd told to get Southgate ‘in to restructure the whole place’ at Amorim’s expense",
      "There was intense chatter over his future after he was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games, with clubs ranging from Real Madrid to Tottenham linked. But the hierarchy, led by INEOS’ Sir Jim Ratcliffe, had no desire to let the England midfielder leave on loan.",
      "Since then, Mainoo has had limited minutes: 45 off the bench against Burnley, 28 against Manchester City, three against Chelsea, and the full Carabao Cup second-round defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Amorim has previously boiled p*ss by saying Mainoo is competing for Bruno Fernandes’ position in the team, rather than competing with Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte to play next to the Man Utd captain.",
      "Fernandes is not getting dropped, especially in his current form, and with Ugarte failing to impress and Casemiro suspended after his red card against Chelsea, the clamour to see Mainoo start is growing even stronger.",
      "But spending a club-record fee on Baleba would all but nail Mainoo’s Old Trafford coffin shut. While Baleba’s arrival might excite fans, their academy graduate is the last player they want sacrificed to make it happen.",
      "From a boardroom perspective, Mainoo can be sold for pure profit, a godsend for the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, which only makes his potential departure more appealing.",
      "The prospect of losing him has already angered supporters, and if Football Insider is right that Man Utd will try again for Baleba in January, then the club are effectively willing to shove Mainoo out, whether deliberately or as collateral damage.",
      "The report in question states:",
      "Sources say that Ruben Amorim’s side are likely to go back in for the 21-year-old in January, and that speculation will increase again in the new year.",
      "However, United would struggle to complete a deal during the mid-season window due to Brighton’s reluctance to sell, and would have a better chance of signing the youngster next summer.",
      "Brighton value Baleba at over £100m… Despite this, the speculation is playing into the Red Devils’ hands, with the Cameroon international suffering a poor start to the season amid claims that his head has been turned.",
      "Indeed, Baleba’s head might well have been turned by the struggling Red Devils, and Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler suggested as much after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Spurs.",
      "“Everyone has to understand with Carlos, he’s a very young player,” Hurzeler said.",
      "“It’s all a lot of theory. We can only guess. For sure, when a young boy reads that there’s interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep. Even if he’s not saying, ‘It affects me,’ maybe deep inside of him, there is something that affects him.",
      "“It’s even part of the development, to understand when you play well and a big club comes, to keep pushing, and to stay humble, to stay at Brighton and make the next step as a team.”",

I don’t want to see Ruben Amorim or any other manager lose his job, but you could do a lot worse than getting Gareth in to restructure the whole place.”",

      "Forget Kylian Mbappe or Lamine Yamal, if Ousmane Dembele winning this year’s Ballon d’Or tells us anything, it is that the era of predictability is over.",
      "While in previous years, organisers could be pretty sure the big golden ball was going to either Messi or Ronaldo, four different winners in the last four seasons suggest the Ballon d’Or is now impossible to predict.",
      "That fact could not be demonstrated more beautifully than by the example of Dembele, who appeared to be wasted potential following his departure from Barcelona but has instead scooped the shiniest individual gong in world football.",
      "With that in mind, we are getting out the crystal ball to give you six left-field predictions of players who could win the award next year.",
      "",
      "Harry Kane tends to grab the headlines whenever Bayern do well – which they usually do – but one of their best-performing players is Michael Olise.",
      "Transferring from the Premier League is not always easy – just look at Sadio Mane – but a first season in Germany saw him contribute 30 combined goals and assists in 34 Bundesliga appearances.",
      "The French international has started this season strongly too, scoring three and assisting two in four league games so far and at 23, can only get better. So much better that Liverpool are already said to be sniffing around as they scout for a long-term replacement for Mo Salah.",
      "Bayern have won just one Champions League in the past 12 years and should they double that tally this season, you get the sense that the former Crystal Palace winger will be key to that. And then there’s the small matter of France at the World Cup.",
      "",
      "There is nothing like a Barcelona midfielder to whet the nostalgic appetite but while plenty of have been dubbed the new Andres Iniesta or Xavi, Pedri seems the likeliest candidate to actually reach that level.",
      "Against Newcastle, he put in a masterclass of a midfield performance and while the likes of Lamine Yamal and Raphinha may score the goals, Pedri ensures the team behind them ticks along nicely.",
      "But, Pedri need only ask Iniesta and Xavi when it comes to midfield players not being fairly represented at the Ballon d’Or. Rodri, Luka Modric and Kaka are the only midfielders to win it this century but what does work in Pedri’s favour is that he does not have Lionel Messi blocking his path.",
      "It is also a World Cup year with Spain one of the favourites for next summer’s tournament.",
      "",
      "The Ballon d’Or went to Paris this year and there is every chance it does again next season, only this time it could be going to Kvaratskhelia.",
      "The Georgian was already impressive when he featured at Napoli but a move to PSG in January propelled him into the limelight and he played nine times in the French club’s Champions League-winning run.",
      "In Luis Enrique, he has a manager who can get the best out of him and while Dembélé will be once again one of the favourites should PSG repeat their Treble trick, Kvaratskhelia could steal the spotlight.",
      "",
      "There is nothing like leaving Manchester United to restart your career and Marcus Rashford appears to be the latest beneficiary.",
      "Having held out for a dream move to Barcelona, Rashford has so far made the most of his opportunity and looks more like the player who burst onto the scene at Old Trafford rather than the one we saw in later years.",
      "Rashford’s main challenge is the players ahead of him with Yamal and Raphinha being near undroppable but two excellent goals against Newcastle will have done his chances the world of good.",
      "More of that and Rashford may be nominated for the Ballon d’Or for the first time in his career.",

      "Okay so hear us out on this one but there is a timeline where De Bruyne could be holding the shiny golden ball this time next year.",
      "Yes we know he’s 34 and arguably past his best but making an ageing player look like a world-beater is Serie A’s premium jam.",
      "Two goals in four matches as well as his form at the end of last season show De Bruyne is not a busted flush and there is a real chance that Napoli have a very good campaign ahead of them.",
      "Antonio Conte’s side are favourites for the league and could be a Champions League dark horse even if their campaign began with a defeat at De Bruyne’s old stomping ground.",
      "Let’s not forget that the Ballon d’Or is anot decided by robots but instead humans who can very much be swayed by sentimentality (see Messi in 2023). If Napoli do go deep, could we see a world where De Bruyne, who has only been in the top three once, is given the gong? Unlikely but yes we can.",
      "",
      "Just four English players in history have ever got their hands on the Ballon d’Or, but you have to go back to 2001 and Michael Owen for the last winner from the country that invented the sport.",
      "While the likes of Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard came close in 2005 and Wayne Rooney somehow never made the top three, this current generation appears to have a much better chance of breaking the 24-year drought.",
      "Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice made it to the top 30 while Cole Palmer was somehow eighth, but in terms of the 2026 award, you get the feeling that Harry Kane is the best candidate.",
      "While there are question marks over whether the other three will win the league this year, we can say with almost certainty that Bayern will triumph this campaign, and the German giants are tipped to be one of the strongest contenders in this year’s Champions League.",
      "And there is the World Cup to consider. Thomas Tuchel has been brought in with one goal in mind and that is immediate success, and Kane is very much central to that.",
      "At 32, this will be his final World Cup in his peak, and a good club season followed by a World Cup-winning summer may see Kane join the list of Owen, Keegan, Charlton, Law and Matthews.",

      "And Scholes admits he has a hard time feeling happy for Rashford with the Man Utd academy graduate not giving his all during his final days at Old Trafford.",
      "Scholes said on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast: “I really struggle to feel happy for Marcus Rashford.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude. His attitude towards Man United towards the end was disgraceful. The amount of times I saw him walking because he wanted to leave… His whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.",
      "“I think he quit on Man Utd. When you quit once, you’ll quit again. He was late last night [for Barcelona].",
      "“He wont get away with that for long at Barca. There’s absolutely no chance. How can you sleep in these days? Your phone, f*****g alarm, whatever. How can you sleep in?",
      "“He’s definitely got the talent to be [one of the best players in the world]. But he’ll never have the mentality.”",
      "After going out in Belfast in January 2024 before calling in sick for Man Utd training, Rashford defended himself in The Players’ Tribune as he’s become a media target.",
      "Rashford said: “I think some of it goes back to the [coronavirus] pandemic. I was just trying to use my voice to make sure that kids weren’t going hungry, because I know exactly how it feels.",
      "“For some reason, that seemed to rub certain people the wrong way. It seems like they’ve been waiting for me to have a human moment so they can point the finger and say, ‘See? See who he really is?’ – listen, I’m not a perfect person.",

      "It’s only September and we’ve all already got so much wrong about this season, from expecting an actual real-life title race like damn fools, to expecting the promoted teams to just meekly surrender as has become the style of our times.",
      "We feared for Bournemouth, like massive idiots, we thought Graham Potter just needed a pre-season, like even massiver idiots. We thought Man United would be a bit less sh*t this time.",
      "We thought Viktor Gyokeres would either fire Arsenal to the title or flop hard and the awkward bugger isn’t going to do either of those things.",
      "And let’s not even start on that ‘Chelsea title challenge’ we all talked about after the Trump World Cup.",
      "As always, you can see our pre-season predictions in full here. Laugh hard.",
      "",
      "So angry about this one already. Can’t fault Liverpool, can we? They’re doing their bit. Could hardly have looked more vulnerable if they’d tried, could they? But they’ve still accidentally won all their games despite falling entirely asleep the very moment they take a 2-0 lead.",
      "Meanwhile nobody else can even be bothered. Mikel Arteta is as timid as a tiny mouse with a suspiciously full head of hair, Pep Guardiola is cosplaying Jose Mourinho sufferball for reasons we simply cannot fathom, and Chelsea… well, we’ve got more to say about them later.",
      "Look, it’s obviously very early to be writing off the entire title race, and the main reason people are keen to do so now is in the hope they can call Liverpool bottle jobs later. They are objectively the worst very good team in Premier League history, and a lot of the teams who are better than them at this stage didn’t actually go on to win the league.",
      "But with everyone else shambling about to one extent or other and the sure and certain knowledge that Liverpool are only going to get better as they all get to know each other, it does appear like the best opportunity anyone else had to knock Liverpool off their perch this season was in these early weeks.",
      "It hasn’t happened, either through Liverpool dropping points or anyone else looking much like taking advantage if and when they do. And now it probably won’t happen. The sheer extent to which Arsenal already appear certain to finish second is truly extraordinary. World-class commitment to the bit.",
      "",
      "He is already the Premier League’s most fascinating player. Incredibly awkward, almost sarcastically un-Arsenal, and entirely incapable of fashioning or creating anything for himself, which means that in the big games where Arteta’s instinct is always going to be safety-first, Gyokeres isn’t going to get a kick. Like he didn’t against United, like he didn’t against Liverpool, like he didn’t against City.",
      "",
      "But what Gyokeres does have is an uncanny ability to stick the ball in the net. So in the games where Arteta takes off the handbrake – which across the course of the season will be a far higher percentage of games than has been the case in Arsenal’s undeniably difficult start – he’ll score a whole bunch of goals.",
      "It won’t stop people calling him a massive flop, because a lot of people seem weirdly invested in the idea of Gyokeres as a massive flop. The discourse around him is very strange, perhaps because he is such an awkward-looking player to watch. Nothing about the way he plays football screams £60m superstar in the way it does with, say, a Hugo Ekitike.",
      "He’s going to score loads of goals against all the teams that aren’t brilliant. So he’s not going to be a massive flop. Even now, the only Premier League player with more goals this season than Gyokeres is literally Erling Haaland.",
      "He is, though, going to get called a massive flop because he ‘hasn’t delivered in the big games’. He’s going to be labelled a ‘flat-track bully’ (like literally here). He’s going to be told he hasn’t done enough to shift the needle, because obviously there was no evidence last season that Arsenal might have benefited from someone to consistently score goals against teams like Bournemouth or West Ham or Newcastle or Everton or Brentford or Nottingham Forest or Aston Villa or Brighton or Crystal Palace or Fulham or, well, you get the idea with that.",
      "Above all, though, he’s going to be labelled a flop despite scoring 23 Premier League goals.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola, we owe you an apology, we weren’t really familiar with your game. We should have been, because he’s been performing minor Premier League miracles for a good while now with Bournemouth.",
      "But this is surely his greatest trick yet. Having built last season’s considerable success on the strength of his back five, Iraola has now seen four of that five stolen away by assorted members of European football’s collection of big bastards. Huijsen went to Real Madrid. Zabarnyi to PSG. Kerkez to Liverpool. And, to a lesser extent, Kepa to Arsenal.",
      "That was more than enough to place Bournemouth in the large pile of similarly asset-stripped smaller clubs about whom we had significant fear.",
      "We should have had more faith, because what Iraola has done is simply instantly build another brilliant team built on another excellent defence.",
      "A Spurs team that has scored at least twice in each of its four other Premier League games this season could barely muster a meaningful chance across 90 minutes where the sheer extent of the Cherries’ total control of proceedings was almost eerie.",
      "And that was no one-off fluke. Only Liverpool have more points after five games than a team that should by rights have been thoroughly broken by the events of the summer.",
      "And only Liverpool have beaten them, after a ding-dong opening-night battle at Anfield. Bournemouth conceded four goals that night, but have shipped only one since and an upcoming fixture list featuring Leeds, Fulham, Palace and Forest between now and the end of next month offers serious scope for continued defying of Premier League gravity.",
      "Right now they are Champions League-bound and it doesn’t even feel daft.",
      "",
      "Sure, it was often very bad indeed in those closing months of last season, but patience was needed. Potter is a details man, who needed to imprint his ideas and methods on to a squad not without its charms.",
      "As it turns out, he didn’t need that at all. What Graham Potter in fact needed was a time machine to go back to the day he took the Chelsea job and punch his past self squarely in the face and talk him out of committing career suicide.",
      "We’re almost certain there is now no chance Potter can save himself at West Ham specifically. It’s just too f*cked. What’s really wild, though, given where he was just a few short years ago is that we’re really not at all sure now how he goes about saving his career at all.",
      "Seriously, think about it. When the inevitable happens and the axe falls and West Ham appoint Gary O’Neil or Nuno to try and do just enough to avoid the ignominy of relegation, where does Potter go next? What’s his next step? Who takes a chance on him, and would he be at all interested in the sort of club that would do that anyway?",
      "He might be even more screwed in this equation than West Ham themselves, and that’s a club currently in some of the deepest despair we’ve ever seen, with a fanbase apparently only now able to agree on what they don’t want rather than what they do.",
      "That’s especially inconvenient because among those things are a terrible stadium and terrible owners that they appear rather stuck with.",
      "If you ask us, it all started to go wrong the moment the entire club tried for some reason we’ve never really understood to gaslight us all into pretending their previous much less soulless stadium had always been widely known as the Boleyn Ground and that nobody had ever called it Upton Park, actually.",
      "Seriously, why did they do that? What was the point?",
      "",
      "They won the Club World Cup! And to a less noteworthy degree the Europa Conference! They bought a load of good players again! And sold a lot of rubbish at very decent prices! But still forgot to sign an actual goalkeeper! Which is costing them really badly! And forcing Enzo Maresca to make the single worst collection of substitutions in any Premier League match ever!",
      "Ah, well. An undignified scrap with Spurs et al for fourth it shall be, then. And probably a managerial change as well. He’s just too bald.",
      "",
      "The Barclays giveth and the Barclays taketh away. While the Our League Gods have again, in their infinite wisdom, not deemed it fit to grant us a Proper Title Race they are seemingly going to grant us a good old-fashioned relegation ding-dong after all that promoted-and-immediately-relegated drudgery of the last two years.",
      "Two things were required to make this happen. Some of the Settled Seventeen looking a bit cack, and the promoted trio showing signs of competence.",
      "Happily, we have both. Even Burnley haven’t been entirely wretched, and along with Leeds and Sunderland they have now amassed 19 points from 15 games at 1.27 per game. It’s already pretty much a third of the total points tally the promoted-relegated trio managed last season at 0.57 points per game.",
      "Lovely stuff. And then throw in the catastrophic awfulness of Wolves, West Ham and even Aston Villa, with high potential for your Brentfords or even Nottingham Forests to get themselves into strife and we’ve got ourselves a proper scrap for survival.",
      "",
      "Worth its own section for the sheer scale of its wrongness. But accustomed as we’d come to seeing promoted sides struggle horribly and armed with the fact that Sunderland looked like a textbook example of a team committing the disastrous error of accidentally winning the play-offs at least a year too early in their process, it was easy to imagine they might have a Southampton-esque tilt at the Premier League’s ultimate wooden spoon.",
      "Technically they still might, of course, but we’re not afraid to admit that on the balance of probabilities a Sunderland team that has managed eight points from its first five games will probably manage to scrape together at least another four from the remaining 33.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure what there is now, because at least two members of the supposed six have been clowning about for a good while now, but what we have all been given is a reminder that you can’t just elevate anyone else you feel like into that Big X territory on the back of a couple of good seasons in and around the top six.",
      "It was a lesson that should have been learned with Brendan Rodgers’ Leicester and one that is now being delivered again by Unai Emery’s Aston Villa.",
      "Newcastle are a slightly different matter because there is still the potential for them to work out means and ways of spending themselves into elite security, but they definitely aren’t there yet.",
      "It really is worth remembering that for all their impeccable banter-club credentials, Spurs’ elevation alongside the more obviously compelling Man City gatecrashing of the old Big Four was based on far, far more than a mere couple of decent seasons on the pitch.",
      "We’ve also just now noticed that Spurs now have exactly 1961 Premier League points, which is nice for them.",
      "",
      "Turns out they are just as bad, except against teams that make a series of unfathomably stupid decisions in the opening 21 minutes.",
      "Ruben Amorim remains really quite alarmingly committed to a formation that doesn’t work with a squad that doesn’t suit it, and is now openly goading the dafties he appointed him into sacking him if they don’t like it. Which they won’t because they’re desperately trying to save face themselves.",
      "We now fully expect to see Man United 14th by the November break, Amorim still egging the board on to sack him after every defeat and people still pointing with increased derangement at the ‘underlying numbers’ that supposedly point to corners being turned and a recovery that will quite obviously never come.",
      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",

      "We’re five games into the Premier League season and some of the fears over big summer signings are being realised.",
      "All of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal appear to have made striker blunders, while Chelsea have signed a downgrade and Newcastle can’t get better than Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres is a ‘flat-track bully’ \nThe major concern having watched Gyokeres plunder a gazillion goals for Sporting was whether he could match or even get near those goalscoring heights against superior opposition in the Premier League. The stats are damning.",
      "He’s scored three in five games so far, two against newly promoted Leeds and the third against a Nottingham Forest side whose manager had been in place for about four minutes. Not only has he failed to score against Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City, he’s accrued an xG of 0.0 in those three games.",
      "Mikel Arteta says Gyokeres is “trying his best”, bless him, and we assume the Arsenal boss will continue to insist a lack of service is to blame until Kai Havertz returns to fitness and replaces the Swede for these big games.",
      "",
      "Jamie Gittens is a Noni Madueke downgrade\nIt doesn’t say much for Gittens’ standing five games into his career at Chelsea that at no point amid Enzo Maresca’s irrational substitutions against Manchester United on Saturday was there any great dismay at him failing to turn to the £48.5m winger to get them back into the game. At least Alejandro Garnacho was on the verge of being introduced before being snubbed in favour of Tyrique George and Malo Gusto.",
      "He looks like a man who doesn’t truly believe he should be there, in many ways the antithesis of Madueke, who may not have set the world alight at Stamford Bridge, but never lacked for confidence. And after his fine start at Arsenal, it feels as though Chelsea have simply nurtured, developed and improved one winger to aid their Premier League rivals and replaced him with another at the start of that journey, very possibly without the same self-belief to take those positive steps forward.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz is too lightweight\nWhile we totally understand why he’s been targeted and have absolutely jumped on the bandwagon, Wirtz has not been half as bad as the Liverpool-baiting media and fan responses to his performances would suggest.",
      "As much as anything, we all just need a stick to beat the Premier League champions-elect with right now, and much of the criticism is based around the fear of just how f***ed everyone else is when he and Liverpool actually start playing well. We’re getting the jabs in while we still can.",
      "A common slam is how easily he appears to get knocked off the ball. And he does look lightweight, but we are now all looking for examples which we’re guessing could be found by analysing the footage of plenty of Premier League No.10s. We don’t particularly remember Phil Foden or James Maddison bullying their way through opposition challenges, for example.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko is the new Rasmus Hojlund\nThere has perhaps been no greater sign of just how far the Manchester United stock has fallen than their fans batting away criticism of their new £67m striker after he was hooked at half-time in the victory over Chelsea by extolling the virtues of an Andy Carroll-esque flick-on from a long punt up the pitch.",
      "That was one of eight touches for Sesko in a half of football against 10 men in which he completed three passes, had no shots and didn’t attempt a dribble. He’s had five shots in 207 minutes of Premier League football. We know what you’re thinking – if only he was getting the service. Sound familiar?",
      "",
      "Liverpool don’t need Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak\nAs great headaches for a manager go, the struggle to choose between a striker who’s already got four goals and an assist and the most expensive Premier League signing of all time is a real doozy.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Slot “has to play” Ekitike after his fine start to life at Anfield, but although we would all revel in Isak continuing to watch Liverpool games rather than playing in them after escaping that whole-season reality on deadline day, Slot also sort of has to play him, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze is not a left winger\nWe don’t suppose Arsenal fans care all that much which left winger changed the game and secured victory in their Champions League opener before scoring an equaliser against their title rivals in the very next game, but you would have got pretty long odds on that player being Gabriel Martinelli at the start of the summer transfer window. Nico Williams or Rodrygo may have been more likely.",
      "Martinelli wouldn’t still be at Arsenal if they had received a good enough offer for the Brazilian, but still looks like their best bet on the left wing over Eze, very simply because Martinelli is a left winger and Eze is not.",
      "Arteta should accept Havertz-esque defeat now.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga isn’t worth £55m\nOur suggestion that Elanga may not be worth £55m to anyone else but is to Newcastle was predicated on him being able to replicate something similar to what he did for Nottingham Forest last season for his new club.",
      "Having started the first two games of the season he’s taken up a spot on the bench for the last three, which makes us wonder just how good a right winger Newcastle need to sign in order to one day displace Jacob Murphy.",
      "",
      "Senne Lammens is not a No.1\nAsked whether Altay Bayindir is now his No.1 goalkeeper having started every Premier League game so far this season, Amorim insisted “nobody has a place that is his place”. He may very well have said the same thing had Manchester United signed Emi Martinez or Gianluigi Donnarumma, but either one of them would now definitely be in the starting XI.",
      "Bayindir may grow into the role and prove himself capable, but no right-minded United fan will have any real hope of that being the case, and they may currently be wondering why their club has spent 18 million precious pounds on a back-up goalkeeper who we can only assume is at best a minor improvement on the man currently tending goal.",
      "Liverpool’s performances this season have only been good enough for eighth place in the Premier League.",
      "Arsenal now look like a team without ego, and we should all congratulate Mikel Arteta for carrying that burden of arrogance. The man is desperate for recognition.",
      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £400m and have ended up with a Like A New Signing upstaging them all, while Carabao chances were taken at Brighton and Chelsea.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "United raced into a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro following a red card for Robert Sanchez, but the result was thrown into question when the Brazil midfielder picked up his second yellow of the evening.",
      "Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back for Chelsea with 10 minutes to go but Amorim's side held on - thanks to a defensive performance that Luke Shaw described as \"desperate\" after the game - to secure a much-needed win.",
      "United headed into the fixture with just four points from as many games, their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years, but pressure will now be momentarily alleviated on Amorim and his squad after what was described by Redknapp as their \"biggest win\" since his appointment in November 2024.",
      "\"This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",

      "\"I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls.",
      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two.",
      "\"We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",

      "Speaking after that loss, both Gary Neville and Roy Keane outlined their worries for United, with the former saying a loss to Chelsea would have caused \"big questions\" to be asked of Amorim.",

      "\"I understand that, I'm just joking around all the time. I have nothing to say to the critics; they are right most of the time. But we won, and that's a good thing for us.",

      "",
      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",

      "Amorim did not speak with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe about his system during talks this week, but says there will be changes to it should he get the time.",

      "\"So, a normal meeting, and we had several, but in this moment, it's normal that people pay attention to that.\"",

      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
