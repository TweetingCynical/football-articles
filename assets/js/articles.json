      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane questioned Arsenal's willingness to sit on a 1-0 lead despite the London side winning at Old Trafford. One goal was enough for the Gunners this time, with Riccardo Calafiori securing victory, but that might not always be the case.",
      "Last season, dropped points from winning positions cost Mikel Arteta's side dear. They led in seven of their last eight matches but won only three, throwing away leads against Everton, Brentford, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth.",
      "\"You compare that to Man City and Liverpool. They are always looking to go on and get the second or the third. Even on a bad day they can score two or three goals.\"",
      "Liverpool and City each scored four on the opening weekend of the season, though the reigning champions were pegged back from 2-0 to 2-2 before beating Bournemouth. The draws stat alluded to by Keane relates to the 14 Arsenal chalked up in the league, as they finished 10 points behind Liverpool despite losing the same number of matches.",
      "Keane's fellow pundit Micah Richards was impressed by Arsenal's resolve at the back. However, he also appeared to indicate a more ambitious attacking mindset might reduce the need for that kind of defending.",
      "“It's how much you can dig deep,\" Richards said. \"What has helped Arsenal stay in title races in recent years is that when they get into that low block, they are very difficult to break down. Then you add in the set-pieces and they are a good team. I would just like to see them be a little more brave.”",
      "Arsenal boss Arteta was under no illusions about the quality of his team's display but was happy with the result. \"We came here away and won which is a big result,\" the Spaniard said.",
      "\"We were clearly not at our best. We attacked the box and we reacted well to unusual mistakes. The team reacted time after time in an incredible way. Very proud of that because that is why we got the opportunity to win the game.",
      "\"We showed a resilience and a will to win. They put you on the ropes here, you will have to have moments when you suffer. To find a way to win at this ground, I'm very happy with the team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Football loving writer who spends much of his life on motorways getting to games all over the country. Passionate about football, my job and the Mirror. The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "It was hardly a classic but the away end celebrated to a familiar song.",
      "“1-0 to the Arsenal” rang round Old Trafford after the final whistle as the Gunners ended up sitting pretty by winning ugly for a change. Scrappy does not do it justice and the result was more about familiar failings rather than any of the new big-money signings for either side.",
      "Ultimately, it was decided by a tale of two keepers as Arsenal’s David Raya was man-of-the-match while Manchester United’s Altay Bayındır had a stinker on Riccardo Calafiori’s winner. United have spent £200m on a new front three and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were excellent while Benjamin Sesko had a decent cameo as a late substitute. But unless they sign a keeper, all of their good work elsewhere will be undermined.",
      "Last season’s No.1 Andre Onana is being frozen out, Bayındır is hopeless on crosses and they desperately need to plug the gap otherwise they will not push on. Arsenal’s own big money striker, £64m hitman Viktor Gyokeres, looked heavy, ineffective and the visitors looked way better when Kai Havertz came on. Martin Zubimendi impressed throughout.",
      "But Arsenal, for all their own big-money spending, have not solved the left sided problem as Gabriel Martinelli ran down blind alleys and Noni Madueke barely got a look-in when he came on. Arsenal certainly did not look as sharp or ready as either of their title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City, although you could argue that winning at Old Trafford is still the most eye-catching result of the weekend.",
      "Beating this United side is hardly the statement result it once was but holding on for a gritty, defiant and determined win is still probably a message of intent for the rest of the season. Whether Arsenal have enough to dig in and scrap for enough of these wins remains to be seen. But they showed real character on a day when too few of their players were at their best.",
      "It is hard to read too much into the opening day and, if anything, United should be most encouraged by Mbeumo’s threat and Cunha’s brilliance. But United ended up with Harry Maguire coming on for his aerial threat at set pieces. There were some late scares, last ditch clearances and yet Arsenal held on.",
      "Arsenal are the team which still boss free kicks and corners. That is how Arsenal won the game and the away end unashamedly sang: “Set piece again, ole, ole.” Declan Rice’s corner was whipped in and, for all the warnings about pushing and shoving in pre-season, there was plenty in the United box.",
      "Bayındır's lame attempt at a punch did not work and there was Riccardo Calafiori to head home after just 13 minutes. What a start. But Arsenal did not settle and, if anything, United took charge and provided the bigger threat. Patrick Dorgu’s low shot hit the post. Cunha’s brilliant low cross shot forced a sensational save from Raya.",
      "Mbeumo’s header forced another great save from Raya who, despite his size, looked like a giant as he punched and caught every high ball into the box. Arsenal went through their repertoire of substitutes and their bench now looks very strong but whether the depth will plug the gap for the missing quality and X Factor - particularly down the left - which they need to win the title.",
      "As for United, they do look better than last season. Mbeumo and Cunha are exciting signings and, when fully fit, Sesko will be a handful. But they have to find a solution to their keeper problem. And it is no wonder why United are still in the market for a midfielder because they have holes in the starting line-up.",
      "However, United do look better and there are signs despite the frustration. Arsenal got their reward from a high risk, high reward opening fixture. No wonder Mikel Arteta looked so happy afterwards.",

He has covered world title fights all around the world, Champions League finals, FA Cup finals and Premier League title deciders.",
      "They spent £200m on the attack but if Jim Ratcliffe and Co don’t find another lump of cash to buy a keeper at the back then there will be no improvement in results.",
      "Manchester United’s performance here was better and might give head coach Ruben Amorim hope that they won’t be as terrible as they were last season. It has been a while since United were dominant against one of the Premier League big boys.",
      "But for all the good play they didn’t score. New buys Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who was brought on for his debut in the second half - drew a blank. That will happen against the best teams and especially one as defensively resolute as Arsenal.",
      "But what is unforgivable is gifting goals to the opposition and Altay Bayindir did just that. The Turkish shot stopper was picked ahead of Andre Onana - who was left out of the squad despite being fit - but he flapped at the 13th-minute corner which led to the Gunners' winner.",
      "It’s not the first time he has shown weakness at set-pieces. He conceded a similar goal against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup last season. So there’s evidence it is an issue yet United have not sorted it this summer.",
      "It is quite clear that after two seasons at the club Onana is not good enough to be the No.1 at Old Trafford. Was Amorim sending a message to his bosses here by leaving him out and playing his deputy, who is somehow worse?",
      "If so it was a costly one because it backfired as United got their Premier League season off to a losing start in a campaign Amorim needed them to hit the ground running to keep the pressure off. Obviously United needed to bolster their front line given the fact they scored just 44 league goals last season - the lowest tally outside of the relegated three.",
      "But games against their biggest rivals are going to be won by moments and Bayindir could only slap the ball down to Riccardo Calafiori for the decisive one of this game. He should have been clearing out William Saliba as he backed into him but instead he was bullied by the Gunners’ centre-half.",
      "United haven’t been shy boasting about their sporting structure and earning plaudits for beating rivals like Newcastle to signings. Yet they’ve not thought it was a good idea to bring in a new goalkeeper before the start of the season?",
      "That’s a worrying blind spot if you’re a United supporter. They still have two weeks to sort it out before the window closes but the clock is ticking and they might fall further behind if Bayindir or Onana make any more messes in the next fortnight.",

      "The more things change, the more they stay the same. Manchester United suffered defeat in their opening Premier League match of the season, falling to a 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford - a goal from a set piece proving the difference between the two sides.",
      "That the Gunners’ winner should have come about that way shouldn’t have been a surprise. Ruben Amorim may have splashed £200million on a new attack this summer, but conceding from corners has troubled United more than any other side in the past two seasons; no one has conceded more from corners than their 23 goals in the Premier League since the start of 2023-24.",
      "Conversely, over that same period, Arsenal have scored 31 times. That’s 11 more than the next best: Liverpool on 20.",
      "For all that fingers will be pointed at stand-in ‘keeper Altay Bayindir for his role in Riccardo Calafiori’s winner - and fingers will indeed be pointed at the Turkey international because it was weak, dismal goalkeeping under the tiniest amount of pressure from William Saliba - the goal was just the continuation of a very familiar theme for United.",
      "Amorim promised a new era when he spoke to the crowd at the end of last season, but he needs to stamp out such overfamiliar problems. They will continue to cost his side until he does. And such stupid goals will continue to be conceded so long as his players aren't willing to point fingers at one another and call out mistakes.",
      "\"When you touch the goalkeeper and he can't jump, that makes it difficult for Bayindir,\" said captain Bruno Fernandes. \"And unfortunately he couldn't keep it out of the goal.\"",
      "United looked far better than the side that finished 15th last season – their worst top-flight campaign since 1974. Indeed, Amorim insisted: \"We deserved more. It is clear we were the better team but we lost.\"",
      "This was far from a vintage performance from Arsenal. They were some way below their best. But they walk away with three points and an opening day success away from home. For all their huff and puff, United left with nothing.",
      "Indeed, Arsenal allowed 22 shots on their goal. The last time United managed that many against the Gunners in the Premier League, they managed 25 and scored EIGHT in an infamous 8-2 thrashing 14 years ago. This time, David Raya only made one real save of note, a brilliant low fingertip save to deny £62.5m Matheus Cunha.",
      "For Amorim, it was his 15th defeat in 28 Premier League games. Remarkably, it is the fastest a manager has reached 15 defeats in the top flight - provided he hasn't taken over a newly promoted team - since Paul Hart hit 15 losses in 27 games as Portsmouth boss in 2009, 16 years ago.",
      "More will almost certainly follow unless he improves his side's defending at set pieces. He can focus on having his side play 'his way' as much as he likes. But they need to start doing the rest right too.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A howler from Altay Bayindir condemned Manchester United to an opening-day defeat and gifted Arsenal three points in their fresh pursuit of the Premier League title. Mikel Arteta's side weren't at their best but did enough to quell the Red Devils, who had an afternoon of deja vu - conceding from a set piece and failing to score.",
      "Arsenal took just 13 minutes to break the deadlock, profiting from Bayindir's error. United's backup goalkeeper, given the nod over the fit-again Andre Onana, flapped at a corner and allowed Riccardo Calafiori a simple tap-in after evading the home defence.",
      "An end-to-end first half saw no more goals, with the visitors in front. United pushed for an equaliser throughout the second 45, as Ruben Amorim introduced Benjmamin Sesko in search of a goal.",
      "But Arsenal held firm to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City at this early stage. For the Red Devils, it was a largely positive display but a reminder of how big Amorim's challenge truly is, on a day where he set an unwanted 16-year Premier League record.",
      "Here are five talking points from Old Trafford.",
      "Barring the two debutants for each side, the big talking point when team news was confirmed was the absence of Andre Onana from United's squad. The Cameroonian goalkeeper missed the entirety of pre-season with a hamstring injury but despite being full recovered, Altay Bayindir got the nod.",
      "Ruben Amorim would surely regret his decision when in the 13th minute, Bayindir failed his first test. Declan Rice patiently waited to swing in a corner, increasing the tension among the hosts' defence.",
      "His delivery was right on top of Bayindir and with minimal contact from William Saliba, the Turkey international was shoved out the way and could only get half a punch on the ball. Riccardo Calafiori was lurking at the back post for the simplest finish of his career, as Bayindir's appeals for a foul fell on deaf ears.",
      "It was a tale of two goalkeepers in the first half. Although Arsenal boasted the lead at the break, United had fired off double the amount of attempts on goal and hit post through Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The Red Devils were dangerous on the counter attack, with Bryan Mbeumo a constant threat in the channel between Gabriel Magalhaes and Calafiori. But it was Matheus Cunha who forced David Raya into a magnificent save which kept the Gunners ahead just before half-time.",
      "After battling with Rice on the left-hand side of the box, United's new No.10 did well to get a shot off which looked destined to find the net. In a brilliant reaction save, Raya got down to his left and flicked the ball away, leaving Cunha in disbelief.",
      "Arsenal's goalkeeper hadn't been perfect in the first half but did his job when it mattered - just like late on to push away Mbeumo's header. There was much to improve on for the Gunners in the second period but crucially, they had the advantage.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was always going to be playing at Old Trafford on Sunday, there only question for most of the summer transfer window was on which side? Arsenal won the race for his signature in July and Mikel Arteta will hope that he's still finding his feet after a rusty Premier League debut.",
      "The Swedish striker's first start for Arsenal could be summed up by one moment during the first half. After putting Matthijs de Ligt on the floor with a nonchalant show of strength, Gyokeres immediately gave the ball away in United's box, wasting an attacking opportunity.",
      "On the hour mark, his day was done. Kai Havertz entered the fray alongside new signing Noni Madueke while Amorim handed out his own debut. Enter: Benjamin Sesko.",
      "After Sesko came on with 25 minutes to go, we got to see United's new-look attack for the first time. Cunha, Mbeumo and the Slovenian striker make up the Red Devil's £207.5million outlay, showcasing where Amorim feels that his team need to improve most.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo got the crowd off their feet with a number of dribbles and darting runs, although they couldn't deliver the crucial goal. Nor could Sesko, who was given scraps to feed off as United chased a winner, with Harry Maguire brought on to help in both boxes.",
      "Where will Manchester United finish this season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "A win and a clean sheet away from home? The ideal start. It certainly wasn't a vintage Arsenal performance, particularly in possession, but they got the job done.",
      "Say that in April and you'd hail it the mark of champions. There's a long way to go this season but the Gunners are up and running, with typically steely defending and a superior goalkeeper making the difference.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The set-piece saw Ruben Amorim's men go behind at Old Trafford after making a promising start. Bayindir called for a foul following the incident due to pressure from Gunners defender William Saliba. While Calafiori and Arsenal's celebrations seemed somewhat muted, VAR did not feel the incident needed to be highlighted to referee Simon Hooper. And Neville simply believed that Bayindir's efforts were not strong enough to prevent a goal.",
      "“It’s going to keep hurting United,\" said Neville from the commentary box. \"The goalkeeper has got to be stronger. I think he will complain that he was fouled. He’s got a player in front of him, there’s a lot of pushing and shoving going on. I just think your goalkeeper has to be stronger.",
      "\"Get that player out of the way. It’s Saliba. He’s not got his arms up, I don’t think he’s done anything wrong at all. Bayandir if anything has his arm on him. He just parries it, it goes through his hands. It’s definitely a goal. He’s just not strong enough.”",
      "Clinton Morrison, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said simply: \"Manchester United need to strengthen their goalkeeper. There are top goalkeepers around that are available and you're only as good as your goalkeeper.\"",
      "Bayindir was given the nod in goal as Andre Onana missed out on Amorim's squad at Old Trafford. The former Inter Milan and Ajax star has been absent throughout pre-season due to injury but is now said to be fit.",
      "Amorim noted that he simply wanted to keep faith in the players that had performed during pre-season. United's boss left the door open to Onana returning next week however.",
      "He said: \"We try to choose the best players for each game, so next week is a different life. This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",
      "Pre-match, Onana was seen in the tunnel alongside United forward Rasmus Hojlund. The Denmark international was also missing from Amorim's squad with a move possible for the forward this summer after Benjamin Sesko's arrival.",
      "The new striker started the game on the bench after signing for the club a week ago. Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were given the responsibility of leading United's frontline.",

      "The £47million goalkeeper was left out of United's matchday squad for the meeting with Mikel Arteta's Gunners at Old Trafford. Altay Bayindir was given the nod to start with veteran stopper Tom Heaton on the bench.",
      "Onana, 29, suffered a hamstring injury in early July and missed the Red Devils' pre-season fixtures. However, both he and United had hoped that he would be ready to start the season in goal for Ruben Amorim's men. But Onana's rehab hasn't gone completely to plan, he's only trained on a handful of occasions since being given the go-ahead to resume and spent the early part of Sunday training alone at United's Carrington training base.",

      "\"This week, we chose these players. No (he is not injured), he’s recovered but the other guys did so well during pre-season, so I need to balance that.\"",
      "Onana has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford this summer, his two years at the club having not quite gone to plan with United's worst two seasons of the Premier League era.",
      "Pre-game, Onana was seen in the tunnel alongside Rasmus Hojlund - increasingly likely to exit before the close of the transfer window - laughing and joking as they watched team-mates warm up.",

      "\"Ben [Sesko] had a very good week but he is just one week here,\" said Amorim. \"It was four or five days he was not training. A lot of emotion, training countries, culture, signing a new contract and new people.",

      "Former Feyenoord defender Malacia has struggled for minutes since returning from a long spell out through injury. The Dutch international ended last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven, but the Eredivisie champions haven't made the move permanent.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim doesn't appear to see a future at Old Trafford for Malacia, leaving him out of United's pre-season tour while working to seal an exit. Sancho, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony were also left at home, with Rashford already completing a loan move to Barcelona.",
      "Sancho had been linked with Juventus earlier in the summer, with their Serie A rivals also in the mix. And now, according to reports from the continent, Roma have enquired about Malacia during discussions over a potiential Sancho swoop.",
      "Roma aren't the only ones keeping tabs on Malacia, either. Besiktas have also been mentioned, with former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer potentially linking up with Erik ten Hag's first United signing.",
      "Malacia was not part of United's matchday squad for their Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday. Patrick Dorgu was picked to start at left wing-back while Luke Shaw - another option in the position - took his place as the left-most of Amorim's three centre-backs.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo started, though there was no place for young left-back Diego Leon after his summer move. Benjamin Sesko, who joined a week ago but didn't feature in United's pre-season programme, started on the bench.",

      "\"First of all, physically, he's ready. That is a big component in our league. Then, he's really smart. Every detail he asks, he's a guy that is always thinking. He spends all afternoon here working on his fitness, so he's ready to play, we will see if he's going to start.\"",
      "United have secured a number of loan exits during the summer window but are still waiting to complete a first significant sale. Rasmus Hojlund could be the first to leave for a fee, having been left out of the squad for Sunday's opener.",

      "Manchester United's midfield could scupper Ruben Amorim's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League, according to Paul Scholes. The Red Devils have attacked the transfer window again this season by bringing in Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nearly £200million has been forked out so far, but the United boss has pumped the majority of his transfer kitty into bolstering his attacking options. Finding the back of the net proved a massive headache for United last term, but doubts still remain over the midfield.",
      "The Red Devils had shown interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, but have since cooled their pursuit after it became apparent the Seagulls won't be parting with him. Considering United's spending spree and the standard across the Premier League, Scholes confessed the engine room could prove to be Amorim's biggest headache.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Scholes, when pressed on what he believes success would look like for United, said: \"It's a tricky one after being so bad last year. Now seasons can change.",
      "\"We saw last year with Nottingham Forest, it doesn't have to take five to 10 years to get back where you want to be. Although it is looking better, I still think there are issues with the team. The midfield, I know we don't want to go through it again. But, top six. I think top six would be more than acceptable.",
      "\"As much as you don't want to say that, I always think Manchester United should aim for the very best and aim for the highest. I am just not sure. I think there are too many good teams now.",
      "\"I think Liverpool, Chelsea and City are all on the up. Arsenal [as well], I did not even mention Aston Villa, Newcastle. I think there is a lot of competition now to get top six.\"",
      "According to talkSPORT, England and Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has surfaced as a potential transfer target instead of Baleba. Nevertheless, Palace have previously suggested the former Blackburn Rovers ace carries a £100m valuation.",
      "Currently, United are expected to enter the season with Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as their primary central midfield choices. Ugarte failed to make a significant impact during his first season at Old Trafford, whilst Mainoo also struggled when deployed as one of two defensive midfielders.",
      "Furthermore, doubts remained over Casemiro's pace considering he has now reached 33 years of age, whilst Fernandes' assets lie in his creativity and finishing ability.",
      "Nevertheless, should any of the midfielders manage to take command of United's engine room, Scholes would prefer it to be Mainoo. He added: \"I think we spoke last year about, what they lack in the midfield is that controlling midfield player.",
      "\"I thought that was going to be him (Mainoo). It seems like it's a little bit confused now. Can he be that midfielder again? Can he be that midfielder who can play in a two? He'll obviously need a lot of legs around him. Or is he now one of the No. 10s? I'm just confused.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is expected to be left out of Manchester United's squad to face Arsenal in a brutal decision by Ruben Amorim. Hojlund, 22, faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after the Red Devils signed fellow striker Benjamin Sesko for £74million.",
      "The Dane has interest from several clubs across Europe, including AC Milan, but has said that he wants to stay and fight for his place at United. That's despite them sticking a £30m price tag on him and with Hojlund having been an unused substitute during the Red Devils' final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina last Saturday.",
      "Amorim's decision, as first reported by the Athletic, will undoubtedly increase speculation over Hojlund's future, having joined the Red Devils for £72m just two years ago. During his pre-match press conference, the United manager skirted around a question about whether the 22-year-old was still part of his long-term plans.",
      "\"He's one more option, we will see,\" Amorim replied ahead of Sunday's 4:30pm kick-off. \"We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "The Red Devils boss also confirmed that Joshua Zirkzee, another option up front, is now ready to return after working his way back to full fitness during pre-season. New signing Sesko is set to be involved against Arsenal in some capacity, having only had a week to work with his new team-mates following his big-money move from RB Leipzig.",
      "Privately, Hojlund has maintained his professionalism and has so far given no indication that he wants to leave. While Old Trafford chiefs were negotiating for Sesko, Hojlund insisted that he wanted to stay and fight for his place, insisting that he's 'more than ready' for competition.",
      "\"The most important [thing] for me is to keep working hard and stay focused and then we'll see what happens,\" the Denmark international told reporters during the Red Devils' tour of the USA.",
      "\"My plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready.\"",
      "Also in pre-season, Amorim hailed: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market,\" he said.",
      "\"The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. I don’t know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a lot because of the lack of goals last season.\"",
      "Hojlund has scored 26 goals in 95 games for United since joining from Italian side Atalanta in August 2023. If he were to leave, the Red Devils would prefer a permanent sale as opposed to a loan deal.",

      "Goncalo Ramos has been linked with a move to Newcastle United, where his arrival could help put an end to Alexander Isak's dramatic transfer saga. The Swede has reportedly claimed he will never play for the Magpies again, regardless of whether he secures a move away from Tyneside before deadline day.",
      "Liverpool remain the only likely destination for the 25-year-old at present, but are yet to re-enter talks with Newcastle after seeing their initial bid of £110million plus add-ons rebuffed. And with less than two weeks to go before the summer window shuts, all parties involved will hope for a swift resolution for the striker one way or the other.",
      "As a result of Isak's absence, Anthony Gordon was deployed as a makeshift striker during Newcastle's goalless draw with a 10-man Aston Villa away from home in their Premier League opener on Saturday. And without a proven No. 9 in their ranks for their clash with Liverpool a week on Monday, Eddie Howe will be eager to recruit himself a new frontman before then.",
      "The Magpies have been quoted £40m for Brentford's Yoane Wissa, who scored 19 goals in 35 outings for the Bees last term. And with the 28-year-old seemingly favouring a move to St James' Park, it could only be a matter of time before a deal between the two clubs is brokered.",
      "However, it's former Manchester United and Liverpool target, Ramos, who Newcastle have recently been linked with which could prove incredibly fruitful in finding a new home for Isak in the coming weeks. The 24-year-old has impressed with Paris Saint-Germain since joining the Ligue 1 giants in 2023, with 34 goals to his name across all competitions thus far.",
      "The Red Devils were reportedly in talks with PSG to bring the centre-forward to Old Trafford this summer before swooping for the trio of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo, while it is said that Liverpool are currently assessing the suitability of Ramos at Anfield in the event that they are unable to secure Isak.",
      "It wouldn't be the first time that the Reds have taken one of Newcastle's targets this summer, hijacking the Magpies chase of Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike and welcoming him in a £79m move. However, holding off on Ramos to allow Newcastle to sign him could prove incredibly beneficial for Liverpool in their pursuit for Isak.",
      "With two strikers in Wissa and Ramos in their ranks, it may spur Newcastle to provide a little wiggle room on their firm £150m valuation of Isak at present, which could see the Reds meet them in the middle to take him off their hands.",
      "It's a big ask for the Magpies, however, who have struggled to recruit top-tier talent in the current window. Not only did Newcastle miss out on Ekitike, Mbeumo and Sesko, but they also saw Liam Delap and Joao Pedro favour moves to Chelsea, Dean Huijsen join Real Madrid, and James Trafford return to Manchester City from Burnley.",
      "It's thought that Ramos is settled in the French capital and that he's not overly keen on a move to the Premier League, despite interest. Meanwhile, with expected wages reported to be in the region of £200,000 per-week, and with a valuation of around £68m at present, it may turn out to be yet another fruitless endeavour for Newcastle.",

      "Speaking out recently, Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini has urged more additions but admitted that the club are limited by financial constraints. He said: “This is a team that has quality and we must try to improve it along with the club. There is great clarity with the club and we share ideas on what needs to be done.",

      "A notorious former hooligan who has twice been banned from football games has named the most dangerous firms he has come up against while following Manchester City.",
      "And despite opening up about his “hatred” for Manchester United, Anthony Phythian named smaller clubs when asked about the “toughest” fans. Anthony, who famously stormed Ewood Park in a boiler suit in 2007, said: “Do you know what, it was never teams you think, like the big clubs, it was always teams like Barnsley or tough towns like Middlesbrough.",
      "“Middlesbrough would bring 50 lads and they weren’t a big firm but f***ing hell, just every one of them was just f***ing at it. Just a close knit firm.”",
      "He added: “Just small teams like that, Huddersfield as well. Smaller teams like that and smaller Yorkshire clubs as well. Barnsley, Rotherham, just rough little towns.”",
      "Anthony grew up in Miles Platting, Manchester, where he would fight in the streets and in school – with football arguments often being the catalyst.",
      "He eventually became a hooligan and he told The Content Cast YouTube channel how he always got nervous before scraps, and said you would be a \"psychopath\" if you didn’t.",
      "And asked about the “tastiest” fixture for a City hooligan, his answer was far from a surprise this time.",
      "“It has always been United for us,” he said. “Always. The rivalry runs deep, do you know what I mean? There was a real hatred. Well, there is still a real hatred.”",
      "However, while Anthony won’t be cheering on the Red Devils when they take on Arsenal at Old Trafford in their opening Premier League game today (August 17), he did say he has friends who support his rival club.",
      "And giving a unique insight into what that was like during his hooligan days, he said: “Yeah, the mad thing is, any time when we are not playing, I spoke to lads, United’s firm, who would speak to each other on the phone and arrange where we are going and where we are going to meet.",
      "“We would go and have a pint with each other and we would shake hands and everything else and then the day of the game they are f***ing bottling each other.",
      "“It is mad when you say it like that, but, that was it. That is what we were all there for.”",
      "Anthony is now a family man with two daughters and a son and he has left his days fighting on the terraces behind him.",
      "Instead, he went on to become a professional boxer at the age of 37, and before retiring, he had a record of four wins and three defeats.",
      "And referring to his past on a previous podcast with Dodge Woodall, he said: “My eldest, my lad, knows a lot of my past and now I try to advise him where not to go wrong as I did.",
      "“To be the person I am today and be able to have the relationship I have with my kids is amazing. I thank God every day and know I am totally blessed with this second chance in life.”",

      "United have been busy and, on paper, far more dangerous. A £200m trio of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbuemo brings pace, pressing and variety. The blend should trouble most back lines, even if the combinations and timing will take a few weeks to settle. Expect United to play more front foot football, look to turn Arsenal’s full backs, and draw midfielders out of shape to create space between the lines",
      "Arsenal arrive with the league’s best defensive record from last season, conceding only 34 goals. That platform remains their edge in big matches. Martin Zubimendi’s arrival adds a top class controller to a midfield already comfortable dictating tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyokeres has been recruited to supply the penalty box punch that sometimes eluded them. With those pieces, Arsenal can mix patience with directness, switching from methodical build up to quick surges when the gap appears",

      "Gary Neville was left speechless after Ian Wright pointed out one potential negative scenario involving Manchester United summer signing Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian arrived from RB Leipzig for £66.4million up front with add-ons of around £7.6m.",
      "For many years, Sesko, 22, has been considered one of the most exciting young strikers in Europe. However, considering he is still learning his trade and joining a United team that only scored 44 Premier League goals last year, there are still question marks as to how he will fare.",
      "Instead of solely focusing on Sesko, Neville also addressed fellow summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, giving the trio a target of 35 goals between them. Wright took issue with this comment, as earlier in their podcast, Neville said Viktor Gyokeres' debut campaign with Arsenal would be a disappointment if he only scored 10 Premier League goals.",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Neville opened up the conversation by asking: \"Sesko, we know less about him. Obviously, we’ve seen bits about him. We’ve seen centre-forwards come to United over the last six, seven or eight seasons and it’s not been easy. There is going to be pressure on him, obviously [Rasmus] Hojlund is still there.\"",
      "Wright then replied: \"The thing as well with him is that he scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season. [Omar] Marmoush left in December and had 15.",
      "\"That says to me as a striker he should be scoring more at that level. I think like Gyokeres, he has got such great ability and physicality, I think he will get 15 goals.”",
      "Neville then went on to say a tally of between \"10 or 13\" goals would be a success for Sesko, providing Mbeumo and Cunha make up the other 25 goals between them. However, Wright again called out the ex-United captain's verdict, comparing it with the much higher bar he set for Gyokeres.",
      "He said: \"What if Sesko only scored 10? Seriously, what if he only got 10. You just turned your nose up when I mentioned Gyokeres potentially only getting 10 and now you’re thinking about Sesko only getting 10.”",
      "As Neville pointed out Gyokeres is older than Sesko, Wright refused to let him off the hook. The ex-England defender then tried to form a point by saying: \"I think 10…” and then found himself silenced by his own internal thoughts.",
      "As Wright turned around to Jamie Carragher, Jill Scott and Roy Keane, Neville said: \"The reason I am stuttering is because I’m wondering how Cunha and Mbeumo are going to do. If he scores 10 and the others can chip in with 12 a piece, I would still say 35 from the three of them is massive.”",
      "When Wright further interrogated him about suggesting 10 goals for Gyyokeres would be nowhere near enough, Neville replied: \"The reason I said that is because I think Arsenal will create so many more chances. They will have so much more play.",
      "\"They are a much better team. He (Gyokeres) is going to be in a better team. He’s going to get more chances. Sesko is not going to get as many chances as Gyokeres. That is where I would be at with it.\"",

      "And according to a new report from the Daily Mail, United did not even make an approach for Gyokeres as they believed the 27-year-old had his heart set on a move to Arsenal.

      "\"In Sporting, they have a very good group of scouting, because we get from that the players that they can buy and then sell to survive. I think he's a very good player, he's going to give different characteristics.",
      "\"It's going to be different if we face in the beginning of the game if we face Viktor or Havertz, for example. So, we need to be prepared for that, but it's not a surprise to watch Viktor in a big club in England.\"",
      "Amorim is more focused on his own new-look attack, with Sesko joined by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. When asked about his potential new front three, Amorim said: \"First of all, we have more than three.",
      "\"They are fighting for the places. I'm really happy. I think he has great potential. In everything he does. He can play different types of football.",
      "\"He's going to feel that the Premier League is really aggressive, he's going to learn, but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That's why we paid so much money to have a striker that will have his history in our club.\"",

      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Lucky to play for United again after he conceded direct from a corner at Tottenham and he practically did it again. Should be nowhere near the starting XI. 4",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not play as much on the front foot as in pre-season and had little hassle from Arsenal's forwards in open play. Switched to the left after Luke Shaw was substituted. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Pitted directly against Viktor Gyokeres, De Ligt's own frame has been the topic of debate in the past but the Arsenal striker appeared overweight. 6",

      "Amorim instructed United to launch attacks through Shaw, who did not disgrace himself at the start of his 12th season with the club. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Offered Mbeumo ample support and got into the box to provide some crosses that came to nought. Made way for Amad before the hour. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Arsenal could have steamrollered Casemiro but they let him off. The Brazilian still merely existed in an area that Declan Rice bossed. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Scored United's goals against Arsenal last term but started badly and did not improve enough. Too rash with and without the ball. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struck the post after a positive charge towards the Arsenal area at 0-1 but struggled to maintain that level of threat in the second half. Rightly booked. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Played one memorable pass but that was about it from a player whose best work is almost always off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with him. 5",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Continued his promising pre-season form and had the measure of Calafiori. Had shots at goal but none threatening enough. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Made a good fist of the centre forward role. Had chances, drew a terrific save from Raya and worked tirelessly all afternoon. 7",
      "Subs",
      "Amad",
      "Injected energy into the attacks from wide right. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",

      "Harry Maguire",
      "Immediately conceded a foul. 5",

      "A home defeat without scoring is familiar fare from Manchester United. Their productive performance was unfamiliar.",
      "United were the more enterprising and energetic team, fuelled by the optimistic atmosphere that was enhanced by pre-match adjustments. United fashioned more goalscoring chances in one afternoon against Arsenal than they did in one month last season.",
      "Yet the bottom line is they lost their opening fixture for the eighth time in the Premier League era. United have been beaten 16 times at home in the league since the start of the 2023-24 campaign. Ruben Amorim was not on his haunches as much but his hands were often planted on his crown.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt dropped to the turf at full-time. United players and staff still embarked on a lap of honour. Purists would rather see them head straight down the tunnel for a raw debrief.",
      "Hope is at least back again at United, in spite of another home reverse. The six added minutes elicited an excitable cheer. There was no air of resignation as there was throughout the defeatist performances of last season.",
      "But no striker and no goals. Benjamin Sesko crossed the white line to the sound of an expectant roar in the 65th minute. His inactive cameo partly legislated for why Amorim did not start him.",
      "Few teams are better equipped to defend a lead than Arsenal, a throwback to George Graham's artisans. United were undone by another Arsenal set piece.",
      "This was an archetypal 1-0-to-the-Ar-se-nal. They were second best for the majority of the afternoon and their supporters were constantly irked by the referee, Simon Hooper. They still shielded their goal for 77 minutes whilst leading.",
      "United, having invested almost £74million in a new number nine, played without one. Amorim has refused to accommodate Rasmus Hojlund after he aired his intention to stay and the strikerless experiments against Everton in Atlanta and Fiorentina in Manchester signposted a similar set-up against Arsenal.",
      "Hojlund is so unwanted he was omitted from the matchday squad with Joshua Zirkzee available again. Hojlund, loitering in the tunnel pre-match, watched the first half from the directors' box but was not visible in the second half.",
      "Mason Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha made up the front three in United's final friendly against Fiorentina. The only goal United managed was an own goal. They lined up together again and this time there was no goal.",
      "Amorim's team was littered with contentious calls and the 'keeper was the costliest. Altay Bayindir was fortunate to play for United again after he conceded a winner direct from a corner at Tottenham in December and it practically happened again against the other north London club.",
      "Bayindir is not better than Tom Heaton, in his 40th year, never mind Andre Onana. United's first choice will reclaim his role at Fulham this week.",
      "Onana himself was cornered by Arsenal in their victory at the Emirates last season. The sight of Amorim's assistant, Carlos Fernandes, stood forlornly in the technical area was as familiar as United trailing at half-time without scoring.",
      "It was in the 27th minute that the absence of Amad and a striker was visible. Mbeumo delayed his pass too long for the overlapping and offside Diogo Dalot, who crossed to an invisible centre forward, much to the supporters' chagrin. The broadcasters zoomed in on a watchful Sesko. Amad was the first game-changer sent on by Amorim.",
      "Sesko remained in the dugout when the first batch of substitutes headed out to warm up a minute into the second half. Zirkzee was among those to limber up. Amad was soon summoned and his sprints along the touchline were more urgent. Sesko joined them five minutes later.",
      "Amad and Bruno Fernandes were the only two players who started in all five of United's pre-season friendlies. To bench Amad was pragmatic, bordering on the negative. United were lifted by his zig-zag bursts into the Arsenal area.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres and Sesko could have easily joined their opponents. The Stretford End heckled Gyokeres with a rendition of \"You fat b*****d\". It would be diplomatic to describe him as heavy. So heavy that Casemiro caught up with Gyokeres in the United third after losing the ball inside the Arsenal half. The hostility from the United fans continued up to Gyokeres' withdrawal on the hour.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo gave a glimpse of how productive United's new front three could be. They were responsible for the four on-target attempts from United in the first half. Patrick Dorgu pinged the post. Mbeumo had the measure of the rash Riccardo Calafiori, booked in the 42nd minute for a tactical foul. Calafiori was still the only one to get on the scoresheet.",
      "Mount continues to produce his finest work off the ball. Amorim has a blind spot with Mount, misguidedly promoted to the Europa League final starting XI at the expense of Alejandro Garnacho. Mount and Casemiro were both hooked simultaneously.",
      "United are at risk of giving up on Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro's purported heir. He replaced him and attempted an 88th-minute pot shot that endangered the Stretford Enders and caused his coach to curse.",
      "Hearty applause followed United's near-misses, such was their encouraging play. Eight minutes in, Declan Rice turned to the Arsenal back four and attempted to gee them up. William Saliba's foul on Dorgu was as much to rouse himself and his teammates.",
      "Mikel Arteta almost encroached onto the pitch to berate the wasteful Gabriel Martinelli after a breakaway broke down. One of the Arsenal analysts reacted by smacking the wall of the press box.",
      "Amorim urged United to commence attacks through Luke Shaw. Sometimes United bided their time, waiting for room to free up either side of De Ligt, the meat in the back-three sandwich.",
      "It was another middle centre back Amorim turned to up the other end. Harry Maguire practically played up front in a team that has negotiated a fee upwards of £180m on three strikers. All three were present at the stadium as United fired blanks.",
      "That was familiar.",

      "Bayindir feebly attempted to punch away Declan Rice's inswinging corner, which ricocheted towards goal and was nodded in by Riccardo Calafiori for the only goal at Old Trafford on 13 minutes.",
      "Bayindir conceded a similar winner at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-final last season when he was beaten directly from Son Heung-min's corner.",
      "Amorim opted not to start Andre Onana against Arsenal as United's first-choice 'keeper had been involved in only three team training sessions since he recovered from a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing in pre-season.",
      "Bayindir started in four of United's five friendlies, with the 39-year-old Tom Heaton the only senior alternative. Amorim bristled at the suggestion that Heaton, who has not played in two-and-a-half years, could have played ahead of Bayindir and reminded everyone of his performance at Arsenal in the FA Cup third round last season when the Turkey international saved two penalties.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal: who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.\"",
      "Arsenal scored against United from two corners in their 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium last season. Amorim felt United's set-up was naive against a team renowned for their set-piece prowess but also appeared to question the rules.",
      "\"I think you can watch the goal, I think [you’re] allowed to do a lot of things,\" Amorim added. \"In the corners we need to do the same. But when you touch the goalkeeper that way, he needs to use his hands to catch the ball, not to push players, or he chooses to push the players and let the ball pass. But again, it’s the rules, if it’s allowed we need to do the same thing.",
      "\"I’m saying that you choose to push a player or to get the ball in that moment. So he chooses to get the ball but he gets pushed and cannot defend himself. That is my feeling when I see the play but we need to do the same thing.\"",
      "Onana was not included in the United squad as academy goalie Dermot Mee assisted Bayindir and Heaton in the warm up. Onana is poised to return at Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa on loan earlier in the summer but a new goalkeeper has never been a priority and United could end the transfer window without reinforcing that department. Amorim eventually said he was \"happy with the three goalkeepers\".",
      "\"I didn’t drop Onana from the squad,\" Amorim stressed. \"I didn't drop one of the other two from the squad, it’s a case of not putting Andre Onana with just one week, without seeing a game, without training. Tom and Altay in pre-season did a good job.\"",
      "Amorim was coy on Rasmus Hojlund's future after he was omitted from the matchday squad. United are looking to sell Hojlund two years on from buying him from Atalanta in a £72million deal.",
      "\"He’s [got] to fight for the place,\" Amorim explained. \"We are going to see what happens in the market. [He has] different characteristics and Rasmus has the same characteristics as Benjamin Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",

      "What a goal that would have been. Wonderful run from Cunha through Arsenal bodies but he couldn't produce the finish.",
      "Dorgu found himself in space down the left and hit the post from the edge of the box.",
      "That was a fine pass from Casemiro but also an easy one for someone of his ability. The room Arsenal vacated was remarkable and seemed to take Mbeumo and Cunha by surprise. Cunha’s movement could have been cannier then and in the end Mbeumo had no choice but to take on the shot. That United suddenly look too reliant on counter attacks is a predictable development and a concerning one with less than 30 minutes in the clock.",
      "When Arsenal give away the ball in the final third, they are incredibly open at the back.",
      "Now you may see how dubious it was of Amorim not to pick a striker. United were bright and threatened at 0-0 but they scored one goal from open play without a striker on the pitch in their last two friendlies and Arsenal are one of the best-equipped teams to defend a lead. The goal has changed everything about this contest.",
      "Amorim just bullishly applauded United’s back four for catching Calafiori offside. The main issue is the midfield. Fernandes has not started well and Casemiro is merely existing out there. It remains a scandal that United allowed Rice to slip the net.",
      "Casemiro has been a passenger in midfield in the first 20 minutes, chasing Arsenal shadows.",
      "Fernandes hits the wall from a close range free-kick on the edge of the box."

      "A mistake from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir allowed for Riccardo Calafiori to nod home from close range midway through the first-half. Patrick Dorgu struck the post and Cunha forced a good save from David Raya. However, the error from the Turkish shot-stopper proved to be the decisive moment in the contest.",
      "Amorim made a host of bold decisions for his first starting 11 of the season with the latest arrival, Sesko, named on the bench for the Premier League opener.",
      "However, Keane felt that the low expectations at Old Trafford continue to haunt the Portuguese head coach's side. He said: \"Overall, I think the game was poor second-half, the expectations at Man United are so low that everyone's comfortable with a 1-0 defeat.",
      "\"It does worry me (that), couple of the new signings, there's a bit of encouragement with that, they get you up the pitch, results will improve - it's always tough against Arsenal.",
      "\"But it's another defeat, no goals. There's still that worry, I had it before the match, what we saw, but you never felt like United had two or three goals in them.\"",
      "He added: \"We discussed it many times before, we're going around in circles, that worry about United at the back. Ultimately, I'm hearing noises about being proud about the performance but they've lost the game.",
      "\"Talk about not being boring, you've got to score otherwise you're constantly under pressure. The first thing that comes to mind about United in the last 20 to 30 years is the goalscorers, they've brought a couple through the door but I don't see it with the other group.",
      "\"Bruno come out and said about the fans but that means little to me, I think the expectations is that low, everyone is almost happy about that.\"",
      "For United, they have the opportunity to bounce back in seven days when they travel to Craven Cottage to take on Fulham (4:30pm kick-off).",
      "Amorim will have fresh selection decisions to make, namely between the sticks after Andre Onana's exclusion, but he will be afforded the opportunity to deploy Sesko from the offset after another week of bedding into the former Sporting CP tactician's system.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

I'm not sure those are likely to come to fruition at this moment in time; they want to get players out of here, and Andre Onana is an interesting situation. They would look for a new goalkeeper, but there's no sign of him going at the moment. Garnacho, there is a good chance he goes to Chelsea. Jadon Sancho, Roma [are] in talks, club-to-club, but he hasn't decided. Rasmus Hojlund his time here looks to be coming towards an end. He's not involved today. Tyrell Malacia could also leave the club.\"",

He joined Borussia Dortmund on loan in January and when he eventually returned to Old Trafford, Ten Hag claimed he had patched things up with the winger.",
      "After a loan spell with Chelsea last season, Sancho informed the club that he wanted to leave this summer and now it is a race against the clock to get that deal done.",
      "Football Italia understand that Hjulmand is one of the midfielders Juventus are interested in signing this summer.",
      "The Danish international has reportedly been on Juventus’ radar since his time at Lecce, before his move to Portugal. The report adds that while Sporting CP are keen to keep their captain until next summer, they may consider selling if a 'suitable offer' comes in.",
      "Having decided against pursuing a deal for Carlos Baleba, United have shifted their focus to Hjulmand, alongside Adam Wharton.",
      "As per Football Insider, former Man United chief scout Mick Brown has confirmed that Maguire will not leave the club this summer.",
      "He claims United have turned down multiple offers from interested parties. \"Man United aren’t going to let Maguire leave,\" he said. \"A few clubs have been interested and had made contact to check whether he would be available, but those talks have not been allowed to develop.",
      "\"They see Maguire as a very important part of the squad, both on the pitch and off it.He’s played consistently with all sorts of pressure, speculation and issues around him, and he’s come through that and proved himself. From what I hear, Ruben Amorim is a fan of him and he doesn’t want to see him go.",
      "\"He’s a leader and an experienced head in the dressing room for the younger players, but he’s also one of their better centre-backs every time he plays. He’s an integral part of what Amorim is looking to do, and there are no plans to let him go. As long as he’s fit, he’s an important part of the squad.\"",
      "According to Caught Offside, Man United are considering a summer move for Lee Kang-in from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The winger is reportedly free to leave due to competition for places in France and has already been in direct contact with Arsenal.",

      "Behind the scenes, it's said that United had no interest in publicly losing a race they were never truly in.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims Roma are 'still waiting' for Sancho's final decision after putting forward a contract proposal.",
      "Taking to X, Romano added: \"United are ready to accept £20m fee on loan + obligation, they want to get it done ASAP. Final green light now up to Jadon.\"",
      "Betis' No.7 shirt, worn by Antony during his loan from Man United in the second half of last season, is currently unassigned.",
      "Spanish newspaper Marca reports that it will remain so, with no current first-team player expected to take the number. Betis also still have an available non-EU spot, meaning Antony could return easily if a transfer is agreed.",
      "Betis porting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing the Brazilian. \"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo.",
      "\"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here. If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "According to reports in Italy, Sancho's salary demands is a problem for AS Roma.",
      "Italian media believe that the deal is likely to be structured as a loan with an obligation to buy, for a total fee of around €23m. However, Sancho's hefty salary is said to be beyond Roma's means, and the club are proposing a five-year contract to spread the salary over a longer period.",
      "It remains unclear whether he will accept the offer or hold out for more, with interest also coming from Juventus and Besiktas.",
      "Man United are not planning to proceed with a move for Baleba this summer despite being an admirer of the Brighton midfielder.",
      "United first held discussions with Brighton through intermediaries before the two clubs later spoke directly. But the Seagulls made it clear they do not intend to sell Baleba in this transfer window.",
      "The 21-year-old has started for Brighton against Fulham this afternoon.",
      "Both Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton have emerged as potential options.",
      "Man United face strong competiton for goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "Providing an update, Fabrizio Romano said on YouTube: \"In case they go for a goalkeeper don’t forget the name I gave you in July. Lammens, the young goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"United still like the player, they still have him on their shortlist. They still have to decide whether they want to go for a goalkeeper or not. It will also depend on the budget and the [new] midfielder. So there is a kind of puzzle for Man Utd in these final two weeks of the window, also including Senne Lammens at the moment.\"",
      "Meanwhile, The Telegraph suggests United must now choose whether to persist with their pursuit of Lammens or change course, as Inter Milan are said to have entered the race 'strongly.'",
      "Reports from Belgium suggested that Antwerp would demand an upfront fee in the region of €15m-€20m (£13m-£17.3m).",
      "According to reports in Portugal, Sporting CP have no intention of selling any more of their key players this summer.",
      "It’s noted that Hjulmand’s €80m (£69m) release clause was only valid until June 15, meaning there is currently no fixed price for the midfielder. As a result, Sporting would now be free to demand whatever fee they see fit.",
      "With Manchester United also exploring alternatives to Carlos Baleba, both Hjulmand and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are believed to be under consideration.",
      "Sporting boss Rui Borges has already issued a warning to interested clubs. Speaking in his press conference this week, he said: \"They know the club's plans for potential departures. They [players] have [release] clauses; whoever wants to [sign them] has to trigger those clauses, of course.\"",
      "Ex-United captain Keane has warned that the price for Baleba's potential may be too high to pay. Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened.",
      "\"Because I still think that kid... he's got to do a bit more. You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha's wife offered her support ahead of his Manchester United debut as the forward was handed an Old Trafford bow against Arsenal. The Brazilian was handed a start in their Premier League opener against the North London club alongside fellow summer arrival Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, who completed his blockbuster move from RB Leipzig last week, was named among the substitutes with Ruben Amorim eyeing a winning start ahead of an important campaign for United. Arsenal would be looking for a positive start of their own with their title rivals, Liverpool and Manchester City, picking up wins against Bournemouth and Wolves, respectively.",
      "United's opener was the encounter of the weekend, but it posed a huge opportunity for the Portuguese tactician's side to lay down an early marker and build on the foundations.",
      "After team news was confirmed, Cunha's partner, Gabriela, sent him a message of support via her Instagram profile.",
      "She wrote: \"May God bless you on this new journey.\"",
      "Cunha made the cross-Premier League move following the conclusion of last season after United triggered his release clause to bring him from Wolves. After completing his move, the 26-year-old described his move to the Theatre of Dreams as a 'dream'.",
      "He said: “It is hard to put into words my feelings about becoming a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child in Brazil watching Premier League games on TV at my grandmother’s house, United was my favourite English team and I dreamed of wearing the red shirt.",
      "\"I want to thank my family and everyone who has helped me make that dream a reality.",
      "“I can’t wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my team-mates and prepare for the season ahead. All my focus is now on working hard to become a valuable part of the team, and helping get this club back to the top.”",

      "Therefore, for the opening match any new signings must have been registered for 12pm on Friday if they wish to play. With Sesko joining United days earlier, it means that they beat the deadline by a long way and the 22-year-old will be eligible to play against Arsenal on the opening day.",
      "If he starts, as expected, he is likley to be joined by fellow new signings Cunha and Mbeumo in the starting line-up.",
      "Sesko scored 13 times in 33 Bundesliga appearances for RB Leipzig last season. He will be hoping to get off to the perfect start with United and make an instant impression in his first game for the club.",

      "With last season's dreadful season in the rear view mirror, United have had a decent pre-season and did some exciting business in the transfer market.",

      "Here is five things to look out for ahead of the opening day of the season.",
      "United's lack of goals were a major problem last season but their summer transfer spree should go a long way to rectifying it this term.",
      "The arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who scored 58 goals between them last term has revolutionised United's front three and they could line up together for the first time against Arsenal.",
      "If they gel together quickly, United could have a much more positive season. Arsenal will hope there are teething problems at Old Trafford this afternoon.",
      "United decided to sign Sesko, as opposed to Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyokeres who was the top goalscorer in Europe for each of the last two seasons.",
      "He spent the majority of that time playing under United boss Amorim and now he will be the man looking to put a dent into their early season hopes.",
      "United should have an indicator over whether they made the right decision in the transfer market at around 6:30 this evening.",
      "One of the big decisions facing Amorim is who will partner Bruno Fernandes at the base of the midfield.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has had an excellent pre-season, while Amorim talked up Mason Mount as a potential option, too. Manuel Ugarte is the frontrunner, though, given the defensive balance he will offer alongside the United captain.",
      "Amorim is keen to add another midfielder to his squad with Carlos Baleba and Morten Hjulmand among the players linked with United.",
      "How pressing a priority that is may be clearer as United pit their wits against an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice, Martin Zubimendi and Martin Odegaard which is arguably among the best in the Premier League.",
      "United ended last season with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa and, as of yet, they are yet to win two consecutive games under Amorim.",
      "In fact, they last won consecutive games when they kicked off last season with a 1-0 win over Fulham and that consistency will be something Amorim must address if United are to be successful this season.",
      "United have won on the opening weekend of a Premier League season 22 times, which is more than any other club in the division.",
      "But they are taking on an Arsenal side who are unbeaten in their last 14 away games and unless the match ends in a draw, there may be a buck to one of those trends this evening.",

      "Ruben Amorim has changed Manchester United's pre-match routine at Old Trafford.",
      "United prepared for home matches by staying overnight in a city centre hotel before travelling to the game, but Erik ten Hag changed the routine following his appointment from Ajax.",
      "Ten Hag made the players arrive at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off. They would arrive individually in their own cars and enjoy a pre-match meal at the stadium. The Dutchman also repurposed a large hospitality suite at Old Trafford and turned it into a pre-match room for his squad.",

      "United have confirmed they will arrive at Old Trafford at 2.45pm to face Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the decision, Amorim said: “I always had the feeling that we arrive at Old Trafford and Old Trafford must be the centre of the game, but we cannot spend four hours there waiting for the game.",
      "“And I feel with these facilities [at Carrington] we can be here, preparing for the game away from Old Trafford and when we arrive at Old Trafford, we have to feel the fans and then go directly to the game, not killing the momentum of the connection with our fans.",
      "“We know that we have a lot of people waiting there for us, to be with the players and to sign autographs. We will try to do the same.",
      "“So, it's going to be the same experience for the fans. But for us it's going to be better because we are going to feel, nearer the game, the momentum with the fans and we will spend less time in there.”",

The Seagulls are reported to value Baleba at more than £100million and there are even some suggestions that a price tag may be closer to £120million.",
      "A report in The Athletic recently claimed, however, that United were no longer pursuing a deal to sign Baleba this summer. Despite that, the 21-year-old midfielder is continuing to be linked with a big-money move to Old Trafford, even if a potential transfer is not likely to happen until next year.",
      "Amid the speculation, Baleba took to social media to post a message to his 195,000 followers on Instagram. The Seagulls star posted some photos of himself during Brighton's 1-1 draw with Fulham on Saturday.",
      "\"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys,\" wrote Baleba in the caption on his post, which has received more than 10,000 likes.",
      "\"Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "Baleba has been handed a new squad number at Brighton for this season. The midfielder wore the No.20 last term and has now been given the No.17 to wear for the Seagulls this term.",
      "United have already been busy in the transfer market this summer with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo all moving to Old Trafford. It remains to be seen if United will still look to sign a new midfielder amid news that a move for Baleba will not be possible before the September 1 deadline.",

      "Manchester United's 2025/26 Premier League campaign gets under way later today, with Ruben Amorim's side taking on Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Lisandro Martinez, Joshua Zirkzee and Noussair Mazraoui are all guaranteed to miss out against Arsenal later today, while Andre Onana could return in goal after missing all of pre-season through injury. The last time the two sides met saw the points shared, with Bruno Fernandes getting on the scoresheet in a 1-1 draw.",
      "So, can United kick off the new season with three points? We used EA FC 25 to get a score prediction.",
      "To complete this simulation, we used EA FC 25 and updated the squads with the latest injuries, suspensions, and transfers. The kits from the 2025/26 season aren't available in EA FC 25, so both sides were lined up in last season's kits, while new transfers may have incorrect squad numbers in-game.",
      "We predict that United could set up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their line-up as follows: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven; Amad, Fernandes, Ugarte, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "We predict that Arsenal could line up in a 4-3-3 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori; Zubimendi, Rice, Odegaard; Saka, Gyokeres, Martinelli.",
      "Arsenal started on top at Old Trafford, and they had two big chances to take the lead in the opening 20 minutes, but Viktor Gyokeres was unable to direct any of his close-range efforts on target. They were glaring misses from the Swedish international, and just before half-time, it was the other new striker who scored first.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad combined down the right to skip past the Arsenal defence, with the latter being allowed to run freely into space on the wing. As Gabriel came across to cover, Amad picked out Sesko unmarked in the box, and after cutting onto his left foot, the striker found the net with a curling effort.",
      "After the break, Arsenal took full control of the game, and they managed to level the score in the 66th minute when Andre Onana pushed Gabriel Martinelli's shot into the path of Bukayo Saka, allowing the Englishman to tap into an empty net from close range. With the score level, the Gunners continued to dominate, and in the 91st minute, Mikel Arteta's side were able to turn the game on its head and find a late winner.",
      "A long ball forward sent Gyokeres through on goal, but as he shot, Matthijs de Ligt recovered fantastically to make an important block. The ball fell perfectly for Martinelli, with the Brazilian sending a sweetly struck volley into the far corner to secure the three points late on.",
      "What do you think the final score will be? Let us know in the comments!",

      "Viktor Gyokeres' insistence that there were \"no hard feelings\" when Ruben Amorim left Sporting CP midway through last season was an indication that he was already planning his move.",
      "Amorim made the switch from the Jose Alvalade Stadium to Old Trafford in November last year while Sporting remained at the top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga. Gyokeres was left to spearhead the team without the manager who had brought him to the club and, despite a rocky period initially, helped the side retain their domestic crown and lift the Taca de Portugal.",
      "Last month, Gyokeres followed his former manager to the Premier League, but chose to sign for rivals Arsenal rather than Amorim's Manchester United. The Swedish forward's £64million transfer fee means he arrives with enormous expectations to deliver under Mikel Arteta as the Gunners look to improve on their second-placed finishes across the last three campaigns.",
      "As if Gyokeres' debut arriving on Sunday against United at Old Trafford wasn't enough pressure, all attention will be on his display against the club and manager he essentially snubbed. Amorim will be aware of the danger the 27-year-old presents, as Gyokeres netted his first goal in an Arsenal shirt during the pre-season victory over Athletic Club last weekend.",
      "And to make the two English powerhouses' 2025/26 Premier League opener even more intriguing, United have since brought in former Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko. There is likely to be a warm embrace between Amorim and Gyokeres despite some Sporting players being upset by the manner of his departure last autumn.",
      "After United forked out £11m to release him from his contract, the 40-year-old tactician did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later, remaining with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League, and Braga.",
      "Following a 4-2 comeback victory in his final match against Braga, wing-back Geny Catamo revealed to Bar Da Liga how devastated the squad felt watching their boss leave after such a triumphant result, explaining: \"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "Gyokeres, whilst acknowledging his sadness at the announcement, emphasised that he held no grudges against the young manager’s decision during an interview with SIC earlier this year.",
      "The forward explained: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Gyokeres’ comments came despite his agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, previously stating Amorim was the main reason his client joined Sporting two summers ago.",
      "Cetinkaya had also revealed that several Premier League clubs were keen on signing the Swedish international last summer following his impressive breakthrough season, but Gyokeres chose to stay due to Amorim remaining at the helm.",
      "His soft stance on Amorim's exit may have also subtly hinted that he was already set on his own move, while his more distraught team-mates knew they'd be staying put. That, coupled with his agent's comments, means it's not surprising that he too decided to leave this summer.",
      "Sunday's fixture provides the perfect opportunity for both Amorim and Gyokeres to prove a point to each other.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim denied us the ‘battle of the new No.9s’ we were after from the off at Old Trafford, with Benjamin Sesko’s introduction after 65 minutes meaning he and Viktor Gyokeres were never on the pitch at the same time.",
      "And yet, we still got we wanted: the opportunity for a knee-jerk reaction. Gyokeres was – and therefore is – rubbish.",
      "He was hooked on the hour mark and deservedly so having bumbled around the pitch with the grace and skill of a pub player. His best moment of the game was a shoulder barge on Matthijs de Ligt which sent the Manchester United centre-back flying and was reposted roughly a billion times by Arsenal fans desperate for some sign of worth from their £55m ‘final piece’.",
      "Apart from that his first Arsenal outing consisted of quite a lot of running about, dodgy touches and a complete lack of goal threat. We particularly enjoyed that bit when he trod on the ball.",
      "He had no shots, completed no dribbles, made 11 passes, attempted no tackles and won one aerial duel before being replaced by Kai Havertz, who will be starting ahead of him before long if there isn’t a massive improvement. By Christmas at the latest, as one particularly astute F365er predicted.",
      "Arsenal spent most of the summer deciding between Sesko and Gyokeres and although Manchester United’s shiny new striker touched the ball just seven times in his 30-odd minutes, there were good signs from the guy Andrea Berta opted against.",
      "He had two half-chances, both fairly weak headers, but at least he was in position. And there were several moments in the first half as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha broke on Arsenal when it looked as though they were a £74m striker short of getting back into the game.",
      "Arsenal fans will blame the service to Gyokeres at Old Trafford – and they’re right to – but there’s also a sense that this was the sort of game, in which Mikel Arteta’s side weren’t particularly dominant, when there was space in behind the United defence, in which Gyokeres could have made a real difference with his famous barrelling runs, with or without the ball.",
      "Sure, he didn’t have much of a pre-season, the link between him and the midfield will take time and none of his fellow Arsenal forwards were anywhere near their best – Gabriel Martinelli completed five passes in his 60 minutes, FFS – but Gunners fans hoping for their Erling Haaland instead got a below-par Salomon Rondon.",
      "This was the first game since Gyokeres left Coventry that he hasn’t managed a shot on goal and on his Premier League debut at Old Trafford he looked far more like the guy who scored seven fewer Championship goals than Chuba Akpom in his last season in English football than the guy who’s got 97 in 102 games for Sporting since.",
      "After just half an hour, you can see how Sesko fits at Manchester United, in stark contrast to Gyokeres and Arsenal, for whom it is perhaps the unsuitability that’s as big a worry as anything.",
      "Gyokeres makes runs into the channel and Arsenal don’t play those passes. It’s a learning curve for him and his teammates, obviously, but that’s a difficult bond to forge during the season when Gyokeres’ qualities are so vastly different to those of Havertz or any of the other strikers who have led their line under Arteta.",
      "We can’t see it. One game and done for Gyokeres. Next.",
      "A pundit has explained why he is ‘not convinced’ about Arsenal summer signing Viktor Gyokeres as ‘alarm bells’ have been ‘set off’ for two reasons.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…",
      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright has stated that Viktor Gyokeres is “another level” to Benjamin Sesko, with the Manchester United new boy’s previous returns a “worry.”",
      "A former Brighton team-mate thinks Viktor Gyokeres will flop at Arsenal this season after he was left unimpressed by the Sweden international.",
      "There is glee about a Proper Title Race, debate over whether Viktor Gyokeres will fly or flop, a tip for Nuno to be sacked and excitement over…Everton?!",
      "Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker agree that Arsenal will not win the title this season but Micah Richards insists the signing of Viktor Gyokeres is “massive”."

      "Going to be more of this from these two this season, is it? Oh great.",
      "As the away side, Arsenal at least have some excuse for being pretty boring and uninspired after Altay Bayindir placed a pretty routine down-the-throat corner directly onto the head of Riccardo Calafiori, who we swear laughed as he gently nuzzled it over the line with as much force as it takes to go nose-to-snout with a big stupid friendly labrador.",
      "Still, we had hoped for more from them – some sense that they might have upped their game from last season, or that they were keen to see what Viktor Gyokeres could actually do if they, you know, gave him the ball in front of goal or something. Feels a bit weird to cry out for a good centre-forward and then pretend he doesn’t exist – not that he especially helped himself when the ball did come his way. Maybe another day.",
      "We are left once again that Arteta has grown much too conservative for his own good. With the home crowd deflated by that all-too-familiar route to goal, United were there to be got at again. Kill the game off, lads? Nah. But hey: they won on the road, so fine. Chalk it up as a rugged, resilient victory.",
      "MORE PREMIER LEAGUE ON F365\n👉 Chelsea pair give Maresca ammo to win battle with Blues bosses in laboured Palace draw\n👉 Guardiola and Wolves left with same hope: that New Man City really are as good as they looked\n👉 Nottingham Forest’s impressive evolution could make them even bigger contenders",
      "Manchester United meanwhile…well, they were clearly better than Arsenal for much of the game, but to come from a goal behind, they had to be a lot better. It turns out playing nine of the side that stank the Premier League out last season plus the actually-good Bryan Mbeumo and Mattheus Cunha still isn’t a vast improvement. Better, but not great.",
      "United fans have continued reason to feel frustrated about that. For us as neutrals, though, their greatest sin in the nine-month old Ruben Amorim era is just how persistently dull they are for such long spells of games.",
      "The repeated errors Bayindir and Andre Onana have committed in that time as a valid talking point, but the criticism has been amplified by the fact that United have so rarely given us hacks anyone else of note to talk about. They only continue to call Old Trafford the Theatre of Dreams because it’s been a fantastic place to go to catch up on your sleep.",
      "Here, Mattheus Cunha was the only United player to bring any kind of verve to the side in the first half. Seeing Cunha driving his way through the entire Arsenal defence several times in the first half was particularly fun, and it took a stupendous reaction save from David Raya to keep Arsenal in front as the former Wolves man shot from a narrow angle.",
      "It wasn’t until the final half hour that United really started to click into gear. They can take some encouragement from that; it’s something, anyway.",
      "Mbeumo looked especially bright in the second half, and helped inspire United into finishing the game strongly. Amorim’s side showed quite a bit more promise here than they did at almost any other point last season. Cunha, Mbeumo and ever-dynamic substitute Amad should have better luck against less defensively capable sides than Arsenal – which, in total fairness, is basically everybody in this division.",
      "Until we see that happen, though, promise is all it is, and there is clearly still plenty more work to be done in the transfer market – particularly between the sticks.",
      "There have been plenty of other sides who have not been anything like their best and have issues to address: Liverpool, Newcastle, Villa.",
      "But for the sake of our continued sanity over the course of the season, it is United and Arsenal we most want to see raise their game and show us something more."

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "17=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "11=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "11=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "11=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "9) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season was encouraging but that opening defeat to Forest really was stark. If things do not pick up against Aston Villa and then Sunderland before the first international break, a rethink might well be prompted.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer."

      "Arsenal have made an early play for the Premier League prize money crown as the only side to have all of their possible games so far picked for live TV.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Liverpool) – £45m",
      "5th (Nottingham Forest) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Brighton) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Fulham) – £37.1m",
      "8th (Aston Villa) – £34.5m",
      "9th (Chelsea) – £31.9m",
      "10th (Crystal Palace) – £29.1m",
      "11th (Newcastle) – £26.5m",
      "12th (Arsenal) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Everton) – £21.2m",
      "14th (Leeds) – £18.6m",
      "15th (Manchester United) – £15.9m",
      "16th (Bournemouth) – £13.3m",
      "17th (Brentford) – £10.7m",
      "18th (Burnley) – £7.9m",
      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "1st) Arsenal (6 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £4.98m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Nottingham Forest (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=7th) Brentford, Everton, Newcastle and West Ham (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "=11th) Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Leeds and Spurs (3 games) – worth around £2.49m",
      "=16th) Brighton, Sunderland and Wolves (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",
      "=19th) Bournemouth and Burnley (1 game) – worth around £0.83m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in October – by August 20\nMatches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival."

      "Undoubtedly the highlight of the opening weekend is Manchester United’s home fixture against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s start at Manchester United was the stuff of nightmares, with a 15th-placed finish and a disappointing defeat to Spurs in the Europa League compounding a miserable time for the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "However, a triple swoop for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha has many predicting a better season for the Red Devils.",
      "There are also rumours surrounding a potential move for Carlos Baleba, so it’s clear to see that Amorim has been backed from the boardroom, but the real question is whether he can succeed where many predecessors have failed and transfer that on to the pitch.",
      "The start to the season hasn’t been kind to them, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City in their first five, so it’ll be a big test for this new-look Man United team.",
      "Arsenal will be a tough test and they have also had a transformative summer in terms of recruitment.",
      "Mikel Arteta has finally filled the void in front of goal by capturing Amorim’s former player Viktor Gyokeres, while they have also brought in Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and Chelsea winger Noni Madueke.",
      "Fans from other teams have ridiculed Arsenal for coming second over the last three seasons, but it’s clear to see the solid foundations are there and their very own Swedish marksman could bridge the gap to Liverpool.",
      "As always this fixture promises to be a fascinating prospect and you can follow it on our live score centre.",
      "",
      "Sesko will likely make his debut after signing from RB Leipzig last week, while Mbeumo and Cunha will likely start for Amorim’s side.",
      "They are currently without Lisandro Martinez at the back as he is unavailable with a knee injury, while Noussair Mazraoui is ruled out with a thigh injury.",
      "There are also doubts over Joshua Zirkzee and Andre Onana.",

      "Gyokeres has been added to their squad and he’s raring to go according to Arteta, so a goal from the Swede is a worthwhile bet.",
      "Despite their woes in recent years, Man United have a good attack on paper and usually find the back of the net in this fixture, so both teams to score is a decent shout as it has happened in seven of the last nine meetings between the two."

      "We get the sense that Ruben Amorim will be looking forward to Manchester United’s opening-day clash with Arsenal far more than Mikel Arteta, for whom anything other than a win at Old Trafford will result in some gloriously early sack chat.",
      "Here are five reasons why a trip to Old Trafford is a nightmare first fixture for Arteta…",
      "",
      "Polar expectations\nEven a couple of seasons ago, Mikel Arteta would have been praised to the hilt for beating Manchester United on their own patch on the opening day of a season; even a draw would have been commendable.",
      "But this is the worst Manchester United team in living memory, or at least it was last season, when the 1-1 draw in the same fixture saw Arsenal described as ‘utter toss’, with Arteta condemned for his ‘Tony Pulis tribute act’. It’s no longer acceptable for Arsenal to do anything but beat Manchester United.",
      "Only one of us reckons Arsenal will win the Premier League, which is as much to do with our burgeoning lack of faith in Arteta to get the job done as much as anything, but they were in all of our top fours, while the only shred of positivity for United to be found in our pre-season predictions came from our resident Red Devils fan Ian Watson, who believes ‘they will be a lot less sh*te if they get a midfielder with legs and a competent goalkeeper’.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres vs Ruben Amorim\nWe’re bracing ourselves ahead of a fixture featuring a new £70m striker per club, both of whom were heavily linked with the other before making their moves to grant us the delicious prospect of immediate knee-jerking into labelling one a genius and the other a flop amid gloating and gnashing of teeth depending on your red allegiance, for Arsenal and Manchester United to start with Kai Havertz and Rasmus Hojlund up front. We beg you – give the people what they want.",
      "At this stage we would be picking one over the other through a flip of a coin, which doesn’t appear to be far off Arsenal’s strategy. But we do predict Gyokeres will have the tougher time on Sunday.",
      "That’s again partly down to expectation – Gyokeres is ‘the final piece of the puzzle’ for Arsenal, who needs to drive them to the title, whereas Benjamin Sesko has a laughably low bar to clear in order to be a dramatic improvement up front for United.",
      "But there’s also no manager who knows what Gyokeres is capable of – and therefore in an excellent position to stop him –  better than Ruben Amorim, without whom the Sweden international would not have got his dream move to Arsenal. Whether the United defenders are able to carry out Amorim’s orders is another matter.",
      "",
      "Manchester United might actually be quite good\nThe defence looks pretty good though. They’ve conceded just five goals in five pre-season games and that area of the pitch was rarely picked out as a problem under Amorim last season. Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven looks to be a nice mix of experience and youth to rotate in the three centre-back positions.",
      "There have been good signs from Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon on the left in pre-season, while Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot provide very different but decent options on the right. The midfield is the obvious concern as Manuel Ugarte hasn’t got near to proving himself capable of granting United enough stability alongside Bruno Fernandes, hence the interest in Carlos Baleba as a ‘perfect’ fit for that role, at odds with the imperfect Kobbie Mainoo and the formerly perfect Casemiro. And sure, we’re also far from convinced by Andre Onana.",
      "That front three could be a real handful though. It’s about as good a trio as Amorim could have hoped for now that United aren’t able to fish in that top pool of talent. The dynamism and hunger to succeed feels like the big thing among all three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with the deep-seated love of Manchester United (or at least greater love for them than Newcastle) key to Amorim’s desire to sign them.",
      "And while an entirely new forward line could be a problem for United, with the relationship between them not yet embedded, it also makes it very difficult for Arteta to prepare his team as he has no idea what to expect from them.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim might actually be quite good\nIt became easy to forget as Amorim lost game after to game to drum up the worst record of any Manchester United manager in the Premier League era last season that he didn’t want to be Manchester United manager last season.",
      "He made it very clear to Omar Berrada when he approached Sporting that his preference was to stay in Portugal and take over at Old Trafford this summer, and said the same again when he was unveiled as the new Red Devils boss, revealing he was forced into a corner by Berrada’s “now or never” ultimatum.",
      "He made a compelling case for not arriving mid-season being the right course of action, admitting on several occasions last term amid some quite extraordinary sack pressure that he may not be the man for the job while many of us queried his unwavering belief in his principles and style of football.",
      "But he’s still here, with his reputation largely intact, after a pre-season he craved to bed in ideas which worked so brilliantly at Sporting and now at least have a serviceable chance of proving successful at United.",
      "There’s a sense of no harm done about Amorim at United. He’s got rid of or sidelined the ‘bad apples’, got a few of his players in and has had time to work with a squad which crucially (hopefully) knows what the end goal is. Could we about to see a ‘new manager bounce’ from someone who’s already been in the job for nine months?",
      "",
      "Or Arsenal might be a bit sh*t?\nWe’re thinking more about the post-match reaction here. We don’t think Arsenal are sh*t, nor do we think they will be sh*t in this game. But, because we will have no barometer for how good Manchester United are, no other games to provide context for their quality, we suspect most fans and pundits will see a United victory as proof that Arsenal have no chance of winning the title rather than say, proving Ruben Amorim’s side could qualify for Europe.",
      "If in doubt, football stakeholders take the path of pessimism, and it’s far more fun to suggest Arteta’s set for the sack than Amorim might be an alright manager, actually.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s first big call of the season came back to bite him just 13 minutes into Man Utd’s opening game against Arsenal.",
      "Halfway through the first weekend of the new Premier League season and we already have a brand new favourite in the Sack Race. It’s a brutal game.",
      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’."

      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes.",

      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",

      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this weekend, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "6) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "5) Joao Pedro (0)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning.",
      "",
      "4) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (0)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal?",
      "",
      "2) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an opening-day goal. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Arsenal legend Paul Merson thinks Liverpool should be looking to sign another centre-back before worrying about signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle.",

Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked.

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.

It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front.

      "8) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million. So this stand off will likely remain until late in the window when everyone starts to get a little more desperate. And Chelsea know United need the deal to happen more than they do.",

      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",

      "6) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Roma\nDortmund remain interested which we think is more out of habit than curiosity these days and Besiktas have emerged as a possible destination for Sancho, but a move to Roma is now looking likely. The Italians have reportedly bid £20m for the 25-year-old. That being true, United should be snapping their hand off.",

      "",
      "3) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nForest have won the race for McAtee, who had attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. A deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons was agreed and Ramsey flew to Tyneside for a medical on Thursday evening."

      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "Here are five things we can’t believe happened only a year ago…",
      "",
      "Scott McTominay replacing Kobbie Mainoo\nMainoo wasn’t quite ‘untouchable’ as he started at the base of Manchester United’s midfield in their opener against Fulham last season. Amid interest from Chelsea and financial constraints which were resulting in mass redundancies under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, no-one was. But he was The Future to a greater degree than the other two members of the trident of hope: Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "He still is in so far as Garnacho is the living, breathing antithesis of what Ruben Amorim wants to create at Old Trafford as the most unwelcome member of the current bomb squad, while Hojlund remains the ghost of the feast. But Mainoo, having been a beacon of light under Erik ten Hag after scoring in the FA Cup final and playing a major role for England at the Euros, now enters a season knowing any football he plays will be out of position under Amorim, who is currently desperate to source a new midfield destroyer who we suspect will limit Mainoo’s game time to such a degree that he will be pushing for the exit come January.",
      "McTominay meanwhile, having been either the midfield bridesmaid at United – as illustrated by his six-minute cameo against Fulham a year ago – or one half of the widely deplored McFred axis, heads into his second season with Napoli as the Scudetto winner and Serie A’s Most Valuable Player, given the freedom of a city in which the love bestowed upon him has rarely, if ever, been trumped since the deification of the arguably the greatest footballer to ever play the game, Diego Maradona.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho assist for Joshua Zirkzee winner\n“What a big moment for Joshua Zirkzee,” said Gary Neville on commentary, after the £36.5m summer signing came off the bench to score the winner two minutes from time at Old Trafford. We all assumed that was the first of many after that introduction to Premier League football.",
      "There was discussion after that game as to whether it was a “smart finish” or something closer to a lucky scuff, and there’s little doubt that the thousands of Manchester United fans who jeered Zirkzee off against Newcastle just over four months later plumped for the latter in hindsight.",
      "He scored just two further goals in the remaining 31 games of his debut Premier League season, combining with Hojlund’s goalscoring woes to force United into spending £74m on a Benjamin Sesko this summer, with Zirkzee’s game time surely set to be further limited by the arrivals of Matheus Cuha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It was Garnacho who came off the bench to provide the assist, having done his typical busy dribbling thing to get Ten Hag’s side back into the game and give the cartel of United pundits plenty of ammo to claim ‘this will be his season’, while the hackneyed insistence that Marcus Rashford ‘isn’t a kid anymore and needs to lead this team’ was also rolled out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha on the bench\nIt says a fair bit about the management of Gary O’Neil that he opted for a three of Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Rodrigo Gomes – a right-back he fielded on the left wing – to operate behind Jorgen Strand-Larsen against Arsenal while Cunha sat on the bench for the first hour.",
      "The Brazilian who would go on to smash their club-record departure by moving to Manchester United for £62.5m at the end of a season in which he would score 15 Premier League goals. Hwang, Bellegarde and Gomes got six between them. It would make more sense if Cunha has been a bit sh*t the season before, but he also finished that campaign as top scorer with 12.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko starts\nHaving been one of Arsenal’s key players in his first season after arriving from Manchester City, Zinchenko should perhaps have seen the writing on the wall by the time his third season rolled around after the second ended with Mikel Arteta preferring to field Takehiro Tomiyasu out of position at left-back over the Ukrainian.",
      "The £42m spent on Calafiori and the return to fitness of Jurrien Timber will only have added to those fears, though those concerns will have been assuaged greatly by him being named in the starting XI to face Wolves on the opening day. But that was just one of five Premier League starts, and three of those were at the back end of the season when Premier League title hopes were lost and focus had shifted to the Champions League, with the stratospheric rise of young upstart Myles Lewis-Skelly doing nothing to improve his standing and mood at the club.",
      "And you get the sense that he doesn’t really know why he’s been sidelined – like he’s been ghosted by a lover whom he talked to about building a life together – as indicated by quite the harrowing excerpt from his recent autobiography.",
      "“In pure personal terms, it was easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional. A player who doesn’t play is nothing. Imagine this little boy who’s dedicated his entire existence to becoming good at one particular thing and then finds at 28 that he’s essentially no longer needed, that there are others who can do the job for him. It’s not a nice feeling.”",
      "",
      "Jarell Quansah as Virgil van Dijk’s partner\nQuansah must have wondered while sitting on the bench for all but three of Liverpool’s remaining 37 Premier League games after the curtain-raiser at Ipswich just what Arne Slot had seen from him in that opening 45 minutes before he was hooked for Ibrahima Konate that caused the Liverpool boss to strip him of his badge as Van Dijk’s centre-back partner and hand it to the Frenchman.",
      "Liam Delap had made life difficult for him, but that proved to be a theme for Ipswich’s opponents throughout the season. They hadn’t conceded. It felt almost cruel at the time, but then, Slot will point to the title and the excellent defensive partnership which was crucial to that and shrug his shoulders.",
      "We would suggest that the thought of Quansah playing under Ten Hag in a year’s time as he walked out at Portman Road would have been met with open mouths and giggles, but then there can’t have been more than a dozen people thinking the Dutch manager would still be in charge of Manchester United at the start of this season.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives."

      "",
      "20) Fulham\nThey’ve signed a back-up goalkeeper. That’s the summer. The only flicker of intrigue is the potential signing of a Brazilian called Kevin, which is as amusing as it is genuinely exciting.",
      "",
      "19) West Ham\nGraham Potter’s a top coach, but his first few months have been flat. Jarrod Bowen, an in-form Lucas Paqueta, and the occasional James Ward-Prowse free-kick are the only real reasons to tune in this campaign.",
      "",
      "18) Burnley\nTheir 100-point promotion was built on defence, and Scott Parker looks set to keep it that way. It might be smart, but it won’t be fun.",
      "",
      "17) Wolves\nMatheus Cunha was the one player worth watching. He’s gone. Unless Jhon Arias takes the league by storm, expect some dull viewing.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nThomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and (pretty much) Yoane Wissa have all gone. There’s still some talent here, but with rookie boss Keith Andrews in charge, survival looks tougher than entertainment.",
      "But the tough season people are expecting makes them one of the biggest talking points going into the opening weekend.",
      "",
      "15) Aston Villa\nMinimal changes this summer. Yawn. Unai Emery’s still brilliant, but the squad feels a bit samey compared to last year.",
      "",
      "14) Nottingham Forest\nLots of new signings, all attack-minded. Big fees for James McAtee and Omari Hutchinson add intrigue. I’m excited to see them, just less so than the teams above.",
      "",
      "13) Crystal Palace\nWithout Eberechi Eze, they lose some sparkle. Oliver Glasner’s style should keep them watchable, but the drop-off in quality will be obvious if he leaves.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nDefence has been gutted, attack remains strong. Andoni Iraola should still serve up entertaining football, though perhaps in the same way that Blackpool did under Ian Holloway in 2010/11.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nLeeds are back, and that’s always fun. They’re back where they belong, people.",
      "Their signings haven’t necessarily been exciting, but they’ve been very smart and point to a more controlled, well-rounded Whites team this time around. We could get some delicious managerial drama as well, with Leeds reportedly considering sacking Daniel Farke at the end of 2024/25, despite leading them to the Championship title. A poor start could see the Elland Road bosses act…",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United\nA grim summer in the transfer market, but still a squad full of players worth watching — Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Hall. Results might dip, but entertainment shouldn’t. Even without Alexander Isak, Newcastle are a good team.",
      "",
      "9) Everton\nDavid Moyes with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye could be box-office. Throw in Tyler Dibling and I’m becoming a fully-fledged Evertonian.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland\nA proper Barclays club returns, with a new face for the top flight in Regis Le Bris and a busy summer. Granit Xhaka might provide us with a lovely meltdown if Sunderland struggle. And lots of young players from foreign leagues are in, which is becoming the norm for a promoted club’s summer window. Not necessarily to great success.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal\nBig summer signings, big expectations. Viktor Gyokeres could be a hit or a disaster. Martin Zubimendi looks superb. Just hope Arsenal don’t go full set-piece robots again, otherwise they’ll plummet down to 20th here.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham Hotspur\nIf the Super Cup is any clue, they’ll attack big games the right way by not being completely gung-ho, while finally looking dangerous from set-pieces. Ange Postecoglou refused to work on the latter and was too proud to move away from the former.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton\nTalented squad, promising coach, attractive football. They should be right in the mix for a top-five finish. Yes, that’s right. I’m going big on Brighton this season.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea\nCole Palmer is reason enough to watch, but there’s quality and flair all over the pitch. Estevao might make us forget Neymar never played in the Premier League. Joao Pedro looks f***ing brilliant. And as always, there are plenty of new faces around the place. The Blues are expected to challenge for the title this time around…",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United\nUnpredictable and capable of glorious chaos. Could be great, could be a mess, often in the same match. That’s why we love them. Kind of.",
      "Bring on a front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, though, with Bruno Fernandes pulling the strings behind them. Yum.",

      "The two Premier League clubs then held talks, but there has been no breakthrough as Brighton want around £100million for the Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba would be an outstanding signing for the Red Devils, but a deal appears dead in the water, for now, anyway.",

      "Arsenal had only won two of their previous 11 trips to Old Trafford. An opening-day victory at a stadium where they have so often struggled is something to be celebrated, however narrow.",
      "They did it by falling back on characteristic strengths. Riccardo Calafiori's winner came from a new corner routine. \"We don't want to be predictable,\" said Arteta. But the outcome was familiar. It was their 31st goal from a corner since the start of 2023/24.",

      "They were indebted to David Raya too, of course. He made seven saves in total, including an outstanding intervention to deny Matheus Cunha in the first half. But few sides can rival Arsenal when it comes to summoning the grit and savviness required in circumstances such as the last 20 minutes at Old Trafford.",

      "\"They were never at their best, but to come here to Manchester, whether it's Old Trafford or Manchester City's ground, is always tough. To get three points is a big for Mikel Arteta.\"",
      "The Arsenal boss described his side's defensive efforts as \"phenomenal\" but there was also an acceptance that, overall, their performance was \"not at their standards\". In truth it was not even close. \"We need to improve a lot of things,\" he added.",
      "The main challenge for him and his players, having only scored 69 goals to Liverpool's 86 last season, is to get back to offensive levels demonstrated during the 2023/24 campaign, when they hit a club-record total of 91 having netted 88 in the previous one.",
      "The club have acted this summer with that in mind, spending a combined £115.5m on Viktor Gyokeres, who started at Old Trafford, and Noni Madueke, who came on for Gabriel Martinelli as a substitute in the second half.",
      "Arteta spoke with obvious excitement about the qualities Gyokeres, scorer of 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, will add to his side ahead of the game. But the early evidence suggests there is a lot of work to do to adapt, both for him and for the team.",
      "Gyokeres worked hard and showed glimpses of his physical qualities up against Manchester United's defenders but he made way for Kai Havertz on the hour mark having only completed four passes and not registered a single shot.",
      "Gyokeres will need more service. He will need to build up chemistry with his new team-mates too. But he was not helped by Arsenal's collective sloppiness in possession.",
      "Their passing accuracy rate of 75 per cent was their lowest in a Premier League game since the 2-2 draw with Manchester City last September and fell well below last season's average of 89 per cent.",
      "Arteta will hope that is down to early-season rustiness but there are broader questions about Arsenal and their relationship with risk, brought into focus by Liverpool and Manchester City opening their campaigns with four-goal victories this weekend.",
      "\"Going forward, competing with the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City, they seem to want to go for that second or third goal, whereas Arsenal are thinking, 'Oh, we're 1-0 up, maybe we'll hold onto it'.",
      "\"That backfired on them last year when they had too many draws. That won't win you league titles and has to improve. Arsenal need to be clinical in their play and really go for that second or third goal.\"",
      "What matters most, of course, is that Arsenal left with the result they came for. History tells us Old Trafford is not the ground for a free-wheeling approach, even at the best of times. But finding the attacking fluency to match their defensive strength is key to their title hopes this season. It remains a work in progress.",

      "The Old Trafford side had splashed out on three attacking players this summer - Matheus Cuhna, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko - who all made their Manchester United debuts on Super Sunday.",
      "But the game was ultimately decided on a goalkeeping error. Altay Bayindir - deputising for the absent Andre Onana - failed to deal with Declan Rice's corner, allowing Calafiori to nod home inside 13 minutes.",
      "And David Raya needed to be at his best at the other end to keep out the lively Cunha and Mbeumo, who signed from Wolves and Brentford respectively.",
      "Late in the first half, the Arsenal goalkeeper needed to make a low, one-handed save to fingertip Mbeumo's latest shot away from danger. Cunha too had already fired some efforts his way, but were handled well by Raya.",
      "The spell of pressure began when Patrick Dorgu rattled the bottom of the post with a thunderous shot. Manchester United continued to probe for a deserved equaliser in the second half, as Arsenal - despite their lead - looked a touch behind their opponents as the game continued.",
      "In the pick of the chances, Mbeumo nodded another effort goalwards after a deflected cross from Dorgu, but Raya was out again to make a spectacular save.",
      "The Gunners registered zero shots on target in the second half and just four overall after the break, with only a few efforts of note after the goal. Martin Odegaard shot from range in the first half, while Declan Rice saw a free-kick deflect behind for a corner.",
      "But crucially, they came away with a vital three points, showing their experience to win a game they were not at their best in. While Manchester United were beaten, there will surely be plenty of encouragement that this season will be more successful all around than the last.",

      "\"The Manchester United players look dejected. They are on the floor but if they keep up this level of performance, which is the big question, they will win a lot of points this season.",
      "\"I thought they did a fair few decent things out there but Arsenal were strong, and that set piece in the first half was the big difference in the game.\"",

      "\"The expectations at United now are so low, that even Gary said on commentary, everyone is okay with a 1-0 defeat. They've got to do better.",
      "\"It does worry me. Some of the new signings, there was encouragement with that. They were getting you up the pitch with a bit of power.",
      "\"Things will improve, it's tough against Arsenal, but no goals and another defeat. There's still problems there with Manchester United.\"",
      "\"And we did it - one - because of the way we reacted to mistakes and - two - unfortunate mistakes and mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have, and we constantly reacted to that. And that's the reason why we had opportunity to win again.",
      "\"You're talking about character and spirit, that's it. I can make a mistake. How do I react to that? In open spaces, we should have killed them.",
      "\"The way everybody tried, the defence was phenomenal.\"",

      "Another Old Trafford defeat. But this wasn't same old Manchester United.",
      "There were shoots of hope in their 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "They played with sharp bursts of electricity and actually hurt the Gunners from different angles with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo maintaining their Premier League form of last season.",
      "Finally Ruben Amorim has players in central areas in attack that can cause chaos with their direct running and power.",
      "Cunha ranked top for dribbles (6) and duels (20) whilst everything Mbeumo did was very positive despite being tightly marked for most of the encounter.",
      "If they play like that at Old Trafford this season consistently, the place could become a tough place for away teams to play. An expected goal tally of 1.59 suggests they were good for at least a goal. No points but promising start.",
      "Something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "Nottingham Forest made a bit of a mockery of Nuno Espirito Santo's pre-match concerns during a fruitful season opener.",
      "Nuno had referenced a 'lack of options' in his squad midweek, something he doubled down on after an emphatic 3-1 victory. \"The club knows the needs of the squad so we have to be patient and see. The faster they come, the better,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps Forest do need additional bodies to compete on European frontiers in addition to Premier League commitments, but this is already a fairly complete team.",
      "New signings Omari Hutchinson and James McAtee were unveiled before kick-off at the City Ground, before new team-mates put on a show of class. They did everything better than Brentford, which, in truth, was not hard.",
      "Still, Morgan Gibbs-White oozed style. Elliot Anderson ran midfield and produced an early contender for assist of the season. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last year, scoring twice. Callum Hudson-Odoi was a handful too.",
      "Nuno should count himself lucky. This is an exciting squad with exceptional talent. What more could he want?Laura Hunter",
      "When Chelsea comprehensively dispatched Paris Saint-Germain in the New Jersey heat back in July, there was a sense of excitement growing around Enzo Maresca's squad. Perhaps they could be a dark horse for the 2025/26 Premier League title.",
      "Cut to their opening game against Stamford Bridge and the difference is night and day. Of course, no one was expecting a similar style of game. Crystal Palace were never going to be as open as the European champions, and the hosts weren't going to rely on blistering counter-attacks. But the drop-off in intensity from Maresca's men was clear to see.",
      "Chelsea looked sluggish, as if they were still dusting off the cobwebs. And it brings into question what their preparation was like before the start of the new campaign. Due to going all the way in the Club World Cup, the Blues only returned to training on August 4 and played just two pre-season friendlies.",
      "Maresca even admitted after the game that this was his side's first proper game since the tournament, as he had taken the exhibitions with Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan as opportunities to distribute minutes evenly, rather than just to his star players.",
      "Some may point to the fact that Manchester City were also present at the Club World Cup and managed to comfortably dispatch Wolves 4-0 in their opening fixture. However, their shocking elimination at the hands of Al Hilal gave Pep Guardiola a chance to bring his players back a few days earlier - July 28 to be exact - and that clearly aided them.",
      "Ultimately, perhaps Chelsea's downfall in their preparations continued to be the size of their squad, with Maresca's willingness to give everyone pre-season minutes costing them against a well-drilled Palace side.",
      "A goal from a set-piece and plenty of defensive resilience. Arsenal's hallmarks were on display as they edged to victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford. But they were also indebted to the heroics of their No 1 David Raya, who is making a case as the Premier League's best goalkeeper.",
      "Raya, who shared the Golden Glove award with Nottingham Forest's Matz Sels last season, having won it outright in the previous campaign, was the outstanding performer in the game, deservedly named player of the match for keeping Manchester United at bay.",
      "Gary Neville was similarly impressed. \"That is one hell of a save,\" he said on co-commentary. It was one of seven made by Raya over the course of the game, the most by any goalkeeper on the Premier League's opening weekend so far.",
      "It was not just the saves that stood out. While his opposite number Altay Bayindir was punished for failing to command his box for Arsenal's goal, Raya was dominant, claiming crosses, connecting with punches and spreading calm through his defence.",
      "There are of course others who have a case as the Premier League's best, Liverpool's Alisson Becker being chief among them. But Raya's performance at Old Trafford was a continuation of last season, and a reminder that he should be part of the conversation.Nick Wright",
      "If anyone looked likely to hand Crystal Palace all three points at Stamford Bridge, it was Eberechi Eze. And he nearly did, if not for VAR stepping in to rule out the free-kick that he fired past Robert Sanchez.",
      "Since the start of the 2023/24 season, the Eagles have won once in 15 games without the England international. Palace have lost big players before and replaced them. Ismaila Sarr is proof of that as he has stepped in magnificently after Michael Olise joined Bayern Munich.",
      "However, an Eze departure could turn out to have major consequences for the FA Cup winners moving forward.Callum Bishop",
      "Based on a one-off 90 minutes, granted it's a small sample size, pre-season assertions that Brentford might struggle this season are right on the money. Keith Andrews' depleted side, missing Yoane Wissa, underwhelmed in every department at the City Ground.",
      "No team reaches top level on opening weekend, it's unrealistic to expect that. But as Andrews himself acknowledged, there was very little to like about the performance levels of any player in a Brentford shirt. They were the antithesis of stylish Nottingham Forest, in fact.",
      "Andrews has undergone a baptism of fire, having to swallow a bitter pill after conceding to a Chris Wood corner routine just five minutes into the game - the irony of which was not lost on the former set-piece coach. He made all the right noises post-match, with emphasis on \"players taking responsibility\", but it's clear he needs a bit of help.",
      "If the Brentford hierarchy do sell Wissa, having already let Bryan Mbeumo leave in this window, they will need to reinvest - and fast.Laura Hunter",
