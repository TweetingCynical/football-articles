      "Mason Greenwood has largely kept a quiet profile since moving to Getafe from Manchester United but the forward has posted a photo of partner Harriet Robson on social media as she celebrates her birthday",
      "Mason Greenwood has shared a photo of his partner Harriet Robson, hailing her as the \"best mum\" in a birthday post on social media.",
      "The forward is currently on loan at Getafe and posted a picture of his partner and their child at a game. Greenwood became a father back in the summer and he and his family have spent their time in Spain following his move to the country's capital.",
      "Greenwood and Robson have largely kept their lives private after the Manchester United academy graduate was arrested back in January 2022, before charges were later dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service. The Getafe star has given very few interviews in recent years with his social media show of appreciation a rare insight.",
      "The player's future in Manchester appears uncertain with the club admitting it was best for him to rebuild his career away from England before sanctioning his loan switch to Spain, where he's largely impressed, attracting interest from several top sides.",
      "A source told The Sun: “They have had time and space to enjoy being a young family and are facing up to the challenge of living in a foreign country. He has had lots of problems off the pitch in his short career, but he finally seems to be addressing them and sorting himself out.\"",
      "Greenwood has scored seven times in 23 outings for Getafe, who have taken well to the forward. Reports have indicated they want to keep the player permanently, although United are set to demand a hefty fee for a player they still have under contract.",
      "The 22-year-old has spoken to Getafe's in-house media team regarding his Spanish switch: “Everything’s fine, I adapted pretty quickly. My team-mates took me under their wing and I’ve just been happy ever since coming here, training and playing the games.",
      "\"The fans mean a lot to me. The best feeling so far is when I scored my first goal here at the stadium.\"",
      "\"It meant a lot to me, I heard the fans quite a lot. Also we had the training day and a lot of fans came out and watched so we always appreciate the fans, they’re like an extra man out there on the pitch when they’re out there supporting us.”",

      "If Manchester City can retain their crown and boost the Premier League's coefficient then they could well do their local rivals a massive favour and drag them into next year's Champions League - which will have a big impact at Old Trafford",
      "Picture the scene. Erik ten Hag settles down in his front room with a glass of wine to cheer on Manchester City in the Champions League.",
      "Yes, that’s right. Ten Hag may be a Red, but he’s most-definitely in the Blue corner when it comes to the Champions League.",
      "The Premier League badly needs to boost its UEFA coefficient after Ten Hag’s Manchester United and Newcastle exited the Champions League in the knock-out round. Ten Hag needs City, and Arsenal for that matter, to go deep in the competition and boost the Premier League’s hopes of getting an extra spot in next season’s expanded competition.",
      "That would mean fifth place in the Premier League earning the lucky recipients a coveted spot in the Champions League.",
      "This is hugely relevant to United as they battle for the top places and they are sixth, five points behind fifth-placed Aston Villa. Fourth place would guarantee United’s passage back into the Champions League, but Tottenham, with all their stars back, look in no mood to give that up.",
      "The stakes could not be higher for ten Hag and his future as United boss is riding on this.",
      "Finish outside the Champions League places, and he will almost certainly be sacked, as was the case with his compatriot Louis van Gaal, who suffered the indignity of finding out Jose Mourinho was replacing him in the hours after winning the FA Cup in 2016.",
      "Finish in them, and Ten Hag might have done enough to persuade Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he is turning around the supertanker that is Manchester United.",
      "United are coming with a flourish and they are unbeaten in 2024, winning four of their last five games. They have won their last three Premier League games in impressive style, overtaking West Ham and closing in on Villa in the Champions League race. Ten Hag finally has momentum for the first time since lifting the Carabao Cup last season and United appear in the mood to do something this season.",
      "Ten Hag has luck on his side, which should never be underestimated, and any other manager would surely have been sacked in December when United exited not only the Champions League, but Europe.",
      "But Ratcliffe was still finalising buying his minority shareholding in United and agreeing to take over the running of all football operations. He did not need finding a new manager added to his huge to-do list, especially when United could not have got the top-quality candidate they would have wanted. United are also still scarred by the memory of Wreck-It-Ralph [Rangnick] and interim bosses when the club hit new lows as it drifted along, rudderless.",
      "Ten Hag must now convince Ratcliffe he is still the man for United when May arrives and clubs traditionally change managers. Qualifying for the Champions League would be his ace card, even more so than winning the FA Cup.",
      "All this brings fifth-place into play and if supporting City and Arsenal in the Champions League were not unpalatable enough, ten Hag could secretly root for Liverpool in the Europa League.",
      "Victory for the Merseyside Reds would also boost the Premier League’s coefficient and possibly make United and ten Hag holders of the Champions League’s golden ticket.",

      "Manchester United ace Kobbie Mainoo is not expected to make an immediate decision on his international future despite increasing interest from England boss Gareth Southgate.",
      "The 18-year-old has started in each of United's last 10 Premier League matches after breaking into Erik ten Hag's starting XI. Mainoo has impressed with some eye-catching performances, none more so than in their 4-3 win over Wolves earlier this month where he scored a stoppage-time winner.",
      "Southgate watched Mainoo, who has already played for England at Under 16s, Under 18s and Under 19s level, during United's trip to Aston Villa on Sunday. However, the Stockport-born midfielder is also eligible for Ghana through his parents and is being targeted to represent the African nation.",
      "Ghana FA board member Randy Abbey told the Times last week: \"The Ghana Football Association is interested in monitoring, attracting, and persuading all eligible talents for its various national teams. Kobbie is definitely one of these incredible talents, and the association would love to work with him and many like him at home and abroad.\"",
      "But according to the Daily Mail, Mainoo is expected to keep his options open until he is confident of securing a place in the England squad, which is not likely until the autumn at the earliest. Other than the European Championships, the Three Lions do not have any other competitive matches until September.",
      "Despite this, the FA are confident of securing Mainoo's services. As per FIFA rules, a player can switch their allegiances at any time if they have only played friendlies, while those under the age of 21 are able to move after three years should they only have played less than three competitive games.",
      "England face a double-header at Wembley against Brazil and Belgium in two international friendlies in March as they ramp up their preparations for Euro 2024. This is before Southgate's side take on Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iceland in their final two matches before the tournament starts in June.",
      "Although Mainoo may not get his senior chance yet, Southgate is set to recommend that the midfielder is promoted into Lee Carsley's Under 21s squad moving forward. The young Lions are next in action when they face Azerbaijan and Luxembourg in two U21 Euro qualifiers next month.",
      "Mainoo has become an important member of the United side in recent weeks, partnering Casemiro in a double pivot. This has allowed Bruno Fernandes license to venture further forward, with Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford providing support for Rasmus Hojlund up front.",

      "The Manchester United boss worked with Haller at the start of his career in charge of Utrecht and later signed him for Ajax. And the Dutchman became a big source of personal support to the player when he was winning his battle with testicular cancer a couple of years ago.",
      "When the former West Ham forward scored the historic winner for Ivory Coast in their 2-1 victory over Nigeria in Abidjan, the Dutchman was watching on television just hours after he had guided United to a vital Premier League win at Aston Villa. Ten Hag admitted it was an emotional moment.",
      "He said: “I had direct contact with Seb on Sunday night after the final. There has also been frequent contact during his period of illness. I tried to support him as much as possible. Of course, he had only been away from Ajax for a fortnight when the illness was diagnosed. For me too, that was a huge blow.",
      "“A sportsman in the prime of his life with a young family of three children and then such an illness. The way he dealt with it deserves great respect. He did not flee in anger but accepted it immediately and took everything he could to improve his chances of recovery and be resilient.",
      "“He has fought his way back tremendously and then it is great that this is now followed by such a well-deserved sporting highlight.” Haller was told he had cancer in July 2022, just weeks after joining Borussia Dortmund from Ajax. He moved to the Amsterdam club in January 2021 after an 18-month spell with West Ham following a £45million move from Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "But the striker has never forgotten the role Ten Hag has played in his career and the pair kept in touch when the striker was undergoing extensive chemotherapy treatment to beat his disease. He returned to action with Borussia Dortmund last season - only to miss a crucial penalty in a 2-2 draw with Mainz on the final day of the season which cost his club the Bundesliga title.",
      "Ten Hag said: “This highlight is so much to Seb's credit after everything he has been through. His story is of course super emotional. From a sporting point of view, it was difficult for him. Last year he missed the title with Borussia Dortmund and missed a penalty in the decisive match.",
      "“That he then is now an African champion is great. Seb is a fantastic personality, a real team player. That attitude doesn't suit a striker, but that's how he always sets himself up. He is modest and humble, just a great player to have in your squad.",
      "“And he radiates calmness and tranquillity. You can see that in his game. He is imperturbable and therefore able to score such a decisive goal at such an important moment in difficult circumstances.”",

      "The offer was due to expire on Tuesday night but the bid, which was part of Ratcliffe’s deal to become the minority owner of the Premier League club will now be extended. On Christmas Eve it was announced that the Ineos chief had agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the Manchester outfit.",
      "It was confirmed that Ratcliffe would offer to buy up to 25 per cent of all Class A shares at a price of 33 US dollars (£26) per share. That is alongside him buying Class B shares held by the Glazer family, who have given him control of the footballing operations at Old Trafford.",

      "He wrote in his blog : \"Of course Casemiro was off-side from the free-kick that led to the corner - that led to the goal! BeinSPORTS viewers knew that on Sunday when Andy and I pointed it out. The assistant should’ve seen it. Casemiro made himself active when he challenged for the ball.",
      "\"There was no way VAR could get involved though because the incident didn’t lead immediately to the goal. It was never a free-kick mind you. Having worked Fernandes out referees have got to be as strong with Rashford now. He should’ve been booked for diving, not rewarded for his cheating.\"",

      "\"Moyes chased him all last summer, but couldn’t agree a fee with United. They wanted £40m for McTominay - Moyes offered £30m. Because he got frustrated, Moyes went shopping elsewhere - only for United to offer the player for £30m on deadline day. By then it was too late.

      "Cristiano Ronaldo had Diogo Dalot’s back when Rio Ferdinand questioned his ability early in his Manchester United career.",
      "Dalot has been a mainstay for Erik ten Hag this season, making 32 appearances at right-back across all competitions. He has two goals and three assists in that time and earned plaudits for his pinpoint cross which Scott McTominay headed in to earn a 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "The 24-year-old joined United for £19million from Porto back in July 2018 and has now made 139 appearances for the club altogether. His future at the club previously appeared precarious after spending a season on loan with AC Milan in 2020/21, but he is now enjoying his most settled spell in the side.",
      "Former United defender Ferdinand was one of those to question Dalot’s place in the United side, but he says Ronaldo convinced him he would come good. “Dalot needs a special mention,” Ferdinand said on Vibe with Five after the Villa win.",
      "“He is someone I doubted early on. I remember speaking to Cristiano Ronaldo and said, ‘Is he really that good?’ – and Cristiano said he will work hard, make himself better and 100 per cent improve.",
      "“He saw it behind the scenes so he knew that. I said to Darren Fletcher when I was at the training ground the other day that he has really impressed me. Darren said that he is a worker, he’s going to make himself the player he needs to be.",
      "“I still think defensively he probably needs to work a little bit. But yesterday [against Aston Villa] I thought he was very good defensively. With the ball, that cross, if we have players running onto them, the forwards will make the runs and we will score more goals.”",
      "Dalot also earned praise from Ten Hag for his performance against Villa. “Everyone gets criticism but he is a fantastic player who is developing very well,” the Dutchman said. “He can play in so many positions and he is improving on crosses. He can score and his defending is improving so I am very pleased with him.”",
      "Dalot has managed to nail down his position in the team at right-back and is now firmly ahead of Aaron Wan-Bissaka in the pecking order. Wan-Bissaka arrived from Crystal Palace for £50m in the summer of 2019, but could be let go in the summer transfer window when he will enter the final year of his contract.",
      "United are planning for that eventuality, having sent scouts to watch Bayer Leverkusen star Jeremie Frimpong. They are far from the only side interested in Frimpong, who has six goals and six assists in the Bundesliga this season while playing on the right side of Xabi Alonso’s impressive table-topping team.",

      "There was interest in McTominay's services back in the summer from West Ham, although a £30million proposal was rejected. It seemed, though, as if Erik ten Hag was more than happy to allow the United academy graduate to move on despite rebuffing said bid.",
      "But McTominay has been invaluable to the Dutchman since staying put, plundering seven goals in 21 Premier League appearances including a number of important late strikes. And his latest has even earned him some lofty praise from Diogo Dalot.",

      "“We need this type of mentality at this club and I think he is the perfect person to show this season that even coming from the bench, he always has a good impact.”",
      "Although he looked destined to be sold for most of the summer transfer window, McTominay has persevered in recent months and managed to re-establish himself as a key part of United's squad.",
      "And in a weird twist of fate, McTominay has been Ten Hag's saving grace on more than one occasion after pressure grew on the Dutchman as a result of the club's worst start to a season for decades.",
      "It was reported back in November that Ten Hag had changed his mind on McTominay, who was subsequently not made available for transfer in January window. And it's even been reported since that McTominay, whose current deal expires in 2025, could be offered a new contract.",
      "Ten Hag's comments post-match on Sunday, where he hailed McTominay as an example to his teammates, underlines that the midfielder has fully won him round. He said: \"There are not many players who can come from the bench and bring this energy and contribute to the team.",
      "\"Scott is an example for many other players, always giving the spirit and always doing the right things. He is ready for one minute or for minute 90, he is always ready. It is great to have such a player.\"",

      "Manchester United relocated club legend Norman Whiteside from his regular seat at Old Trafford, with the Red Devils now moving to apologise to the former fan favourite",
      "Manchester United have apologised to Norman Whiteside after dumping the club legend out of his seat at Old Trafford.",
      "Whiteside spent 11 years at Old Trafford, winning two FA Cups during his time with United. He is viewed as a legendary figure by many at the Red Devils, having become the youngest player to score in both the FA Cup final and League Cup final while with United.",
      "He is also the youngest player to score a senior goal for United and the youngest man to feature in the World Cup. Whiteside came through the academy at Old Trafford and became a hero for his home fans.",
      "The midfielder was forced to retire early due to injury and has held a platinum season ticket at United for more than 25 years. But the club relocated him for a recent game as they reconstruct hospitality areas at Old Trafford.",
      "Whiteside's wife Dee was left furious at the move. She wrote on Twitter : \"So, it doesn’t matter how long you’ve been a loyal supporter. Doesn’t matter if you played for your club, @ManUtd can just dump you from your seat when they feel like it, so they can expand exec seating! Absolute disgrace!",
      "\"I’d like to make clear that this post is not just about Norman. There are a whole block of loyal supporters who expressed their views to me at the West Ham game, but they feel as if they have no voice or platform to voice their anger.\"",
      "United have now responded to Whiteside's wife's claims, insisting they have the \"greatest respect\" for him. But they have insisted the reasons for the relocation are valid despite the anger of season ticket holders.",
      "A spokesperson said: “We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"These happen for various reasons, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders - in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.”",
      "But Mrs Whiteside has been left unhappy despite that apology. She wrote: \"It's not just about Norman, many of the 'United family' we sit with have been in that block for 20-30+ years, and are all really angry about this ENFORCED seat relocation.",
      "\"At a time when the football has been less than spectacular and the season ticket price is increasing!\" Replying to another fan, she added: \"There are so many of us who have supported United together in that block who are angry as hell, and it looks like we count for nothing\".",

      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag has Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba on his summer wishlist - but interest in Bayer Leverkusen head coach Xabi Alonso could complicate things",
      "Manchester United have identified Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba as summer transfer targets - but their chances of doing a deal could be impacted by Liverpool's interest in Xabi Alonso.",
      "Despite failing to make a single signing during the January transfer window, Erik ten Hag is expected to be backed in the summer and a defensive overhaul is on his agenda.",
      "Not only are there question marks over the long-term futures of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Raphael Varane and Victor Lindelof - while Jonny Evans is set to leave when his contract expires - United are keeping tabs on Frimpong and Tapsoba with a view to firming up their interest at the end of the current campaign.",
      "As first reported by The Manchester Evening News the duo's impressive form at Leverkusen, who are top of the Bundesliga after going unbeaten so far this term and having thrashed Bayern Munich at the weekend, has not gone unnoticed at Old Trafford.",
      "Interest in Frimpong initially emerged back in January with Ten Hag understood to be keen on signing a right-back ahead of the 2024/25 campaign. Diogo Dalot has impressed in recent weeks but they're looking to strengthen with Wan-Bissaka likely to be sold as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "Strengthening at centre-back is also on United's agenda with Varane and Evans both due to become free agents in the summer. Lindelof could also yet be sold despite extending his deal for a further year and Tapsoba has been identified as a potential replacement.",
      "While it remains to be seen if acquiring both players would be financially viable - particularly as they look to also add in other areas - United's chances of doing a deal for the defensive duo are also likely to be complicated by Liverpool's interest in Alonso.",
      "The former Reds midfielder has been heavily touted as the ideal candidate to replace Anfield chief Jurgen Klopp, who announced last month that he would be standing down from his role at the end of the season.",
      "Alonso, 42, has earned plenty of plaudits for the impressive body of work he has achieved at Leverkusen who are now five points clear at the Bundesliga summit.",
      "And if Liverpool do decide that Alonso is the man to replace Klopp on Merseyside, then any potential transfer activity at Leverkusen would be delayed, with sporting director Simon Rolfes - who insists Alonso could stay put at the BayArena this summer - keen to let the club's head coach have their say on who stays and who goes.",

      "Premier League managers would be exempt from blue cards under rules outlined - but there are no special exemptions for goalkeepers, who would be sent to the sin bin for 10 minutes",
      "Goalkeepers would be eligible to be sent to the sin bin under proposed new rules relating to blue cards - meaning an outfield player may have to deputise in goal.",
      "It emerged last week that the International Football Association Board (IFAB) have outlined a proposition for blue cards and sin bins : a punishment which would see players banished for 10 minutes should they commit tactical fouls or be caught time wasting.",
      "The idea has already been met with a fierce backlash from several high-profile people within the game, including Premier League managers such as Jurgen Klopp and Ange Postecoglou, but further details around the initiative have now emerged.",
      "FIFA were quick to outline that there are no plans to utilise blue cards at at an elite level immediately after reports circulating the idea were met with derision and outrage.",
      "But, a new report from The Telegraph has outlined that while managers would be exempt from sin bins, there are no special exemptions for goalkeepers.",
      "If a goalkeeper were to be shown a blue card, they can either be replaced by an outfield player temporarily or substituted for another shot-stopper.",
      "However, any substitutions would be permanent. That leaves managers with a decision to make, particularly early in games: Do you give an outfield player 10 minutes, or turn to your No.2 immediately?",
      "As well as widespread criticism from football fans online, prominent figures in the game were not shy in voicing their opposition to the idea, including Klopp.",
      "The Liverpool chief, who was shown a yellow card during Liverpool's 3-1 win over Burnley on Saturday, stressed in his pre-match press conference: “I think everything what the actual situation shows is we should keep it as simple as somehow possible, for the referees as well.",
      "“It’s a difficult job, often quite emotional when we speak about it more so because it’s after the game, and I think the introduction of a blue card would just give more opportunities to fail as well because the discussion will be: ‘It was a blue card, should it have been a yellow card, now it’s 10 minutes off, in the good old times it would have been a red card or only a yellow’.",
      "“These kind of things just make it more complicated. If they want to test it I have no problem with testing if that’s the first step to agreeing or it already being sure it will happen – I don’t know that.",
      "“It doesn’t sound like a fantastic idea in the first moment but actually I can’t remember the last fantastic idea (which) came from these guys, if they ever had one. I am 56 and, pah, never.”",

When he gets used more often to those games, we will get even more joy from it. Because then his scanning and his speed of action, he can get such passes, three or four passes in and get switches in, and he is the player who can really hurt opponents.\"",

      "THE BIG DEBATE: Manchester United moved to within five points of Aston Villa with Sunday's victory at Villa Park, raising hopes for potential Champions League qualification",
      "They've won their last three games, they've got a forward bang in form and their rivals immediately above them are stuttering. Could Manchester United qualify for the Champions League?",
      "That is the question the club's fans are asking now following Sunday's 2-1 win at Aston Villa, and with fifth place potentially enough for a spot at European football's revamped top table next season, Erik ten Hag's side are suddenly right in the mix.",
      "Villa are still five points above them, but with 14 games of the season left, and other clubs above them in sight too, then it is no wonder than optimism is suddenly rising around Old Trafford. We asked our team what they make of it all.",
      "Unbeaten in 2024, with five wins in six games, Manchester United are starting to look like a winning machine again.",
      "That’s not to say they have become trophy challengers again. They clearly now have the jump on faltering Aston Villa in terms of form, but there is one underlying issue that means Spurs, or Villa, will pip them to fourth place.",
      "Despite an upturn this year, United’s Premier League ’s goalscoring record is so poor, and not one that guarantees a long range tilt at top four. Just 33 goals. Everyone else in the top seven is in the 50s.",
      "Maybe Rasmus Hojlund is finding his touch, and while they have Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford too, all are stuck on five goals in the league. You don't finish top four with Scott McTominay as your top marksman. He's currently on just seven goals.",
      "Two lucky wins, in which they had to survive 45 goal attempts, doesn't make Manchester United Champions League material. They were flattered by a 3-0 win against West Ham, and pinned back in their own half for long periods at Aston Villa on Sunday, so spare us the propaganda that Erik ten Hag is a genius.",
      "He still doesn't know his best central defensive partnership and he's still more likely to get a tune out of a subway busker than £85million enigma Antony. Let's put it this way: If United had to play at Tottenham, Brighton or Brentford tomorrow, would you back them to win?",
      "If the answer is 'No' in one, two or all three instances, then a top-four finish is likely to be beyond them. United teams built on conviction would go to those places and dominate the ball, swarm all over their opponents and take away most of the points.",
      "As for going to Anfield, the Etihad or the Emirates... don't even think about it. After 18 months of Ten Hag, we still don't know whether United are best when they press high or sit deep - and nor, by the looks of it, does he.",
      "So Champions League football at Old Trafford next season? If there are only four places up for grabs, the chances are slim and none. And slim is out of town right now.",
      "The top four, in my opinion, will end up being made up of Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. That means Manchester United will be relying on the Premier League, sneaking a fifth Champions League slot.",
      "There are extra places available for next season’s new-look competition and at the start of the season it looked like a shoo-in for English clubs to get a fifth slot. But United crashing out in the group stage did no-one any favours - especially themselves. However, if City and Arsenal go deep into the knockout stages then all is not lost.",
      "And I fancy United to push Aston Villa very close for fifth. United have been a streaky team all season. They go on good runs - Erik ten Hag was Manager of the Month in November, for goodness sake - and then get derailed with one bad result.",
      "But if you look at their next seven games, they only face one opponent who is above them: Manchester City. If you wanna get into Europe they have to expect to beat Luton, Fulham, Everton, Sheffield United, Brentford and Chelsea. I think United will sneak into the Champions League by the skin of their teeth.",
      "Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Yes, Manchester United have won three Premier League games in a row. But they still don’t look anything like the real deal – and they still rely on Scott McTominay to score crucial late headers to win.",
      "United have scored 33 goals in 24 league games this season – the same number as Luton and Fulham. Rasmus Hojlund has found form, scoring five in his last five, but they can’t be pinning their hopes on a 21-year-old rookie striker. There is a distinct lack of strength in depth in key positions, which is sure to come back to bite them in the run-in.",
      "All that said, they could well close the gap to the top four in the next month, with matches against Luton, Fulham and Nottingham Forest on the horizon. But if we’ve learned anything from the Erik ten Hag era, it is that there have been many false dawns before. When it comes to the crunch, I am not backing United to come up clutch.",
      "Yes, but only if qualification extends to the fifth place. Manchester United aren’t going to catch the top three - forget that - so you’re talking about fourth or fifth place to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "With potentially four more games in the FA Cup, Erik ten Hag’s players aren’t going to be over-worked, so they’ll stay relatively fresh. I think that will matter because a few of them are still in their first full season - Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Kobbie Mainoo - for instance, so that will help.",
      "Their problems are at the back with Lisandro Martinez’s absence. Villa should have earned themselves a point and Ten Hag’s side got out of jail at Molineux.",
      "Who are they going to overhaul? It was a big weekend for Spurs. I think they’ll nab fourth but Utd might sneak fifth from Villa who are struggling themselves defensively. If Unai Emery loses Ollie Watkins, Villa will be hard pushed to keep their momentum. So, a tentative ‘yes’ but they still look miles off the pace set by the top three.",
      "Every so often there are moments when you're watching football matches, even passively, when you wonder if you're witnessing the same game the coaches are. Unai Emery is a brilliant manager who has done a superb job at Aston Villa, but how on earth he looked at Leon Bailey enjoying a generous helping of Victor Lindelof on toast and decided to change it is beyond me.",
      "Sunday's game altered there, and while credit should go to Erik ten Hag for picking his moment - something United have been good at in recent years regardless of their manager or their struggles - it still felt a bit more like Villa tripping themselves up than anything the visitors did to impact the game.",
      "United still don't convince you that they can do that on a consistent basis, and I'd still say Villa are a more cohesive side than them, while I'm happy to back Tottenham and their calm, cool culture imposed by Big Ange to come fourth. In the Premier League's zero sum game that leaves United sixth, and on the balance of what we've seen so far that table wouldn't lie.",
      "After 24 Premier League matches, Manchester United have a goal difference of zero and you have to go as far down as 13th-placed Bournemouth to find a team that has scored fewer. So, let’s not get carried away by a run of three victories, the last of which was a slightly unlikely one against an Aston Villa team who dominated large parts of the game.",
      "But leaving aside a trip to the Etihad at the beginning of next month, United have a series of very winnable fixtures immediately ahead of them. Six of their next seven Premier League games are against teams below them in the table.",
      "But while there has been distinct improvement in this United team, is it better than Villa and Spurs, the sides above Eric ten Hag’s sixth-placed men? The answer, quite simply, is no. And that is why there will be no Champions League football at Old Trafford next season.",
      "I think Manchester United will finish fifth. It’s unclear at this stage whether that will be enough for the Red Devils to qualify for the Champions League, but I can’t see anyone forcing Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City out of the top four.",
      "This would leave a gap for United to jump into. Erik ten Hag’s side sit sixth, five points behind Villa but they have won their last three league matches and are hitting form at a good time. They are also not in Europe and face much less disruption compared to Villa. If United can keep Rasmus Hojlund fit and firing, then I have no doubt they will finish fifth. With five goals in his last five matches, he is that important at the moment.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle are five points worse off than United in seventh, but I feel that they aren’t consistent enough both offensively and defensively to challenge the top six. I think the Magpies will finish seventh, with Chelsea eighth, Brighton ninth and West Ham in 10th.",
      "United have gathered some momentum but I still think they have given themselves too much to do - even if five Premier League teams qualify for the Champions League.",
      "United are relying too much on individual moments of genuine quality at the moment. Until they start to dominate games from start to finish then they remain outsiders, in my opinion.",
      "United have a couple of “winnable” games approaching, but at the moment it wouldn’t be a surprise if they dropped points at Luton or at home to Fulham. Until that stops then they can’t be considered serious contenders for Champions League qualification.",
      "There are two ways of looking at this. The fact Scott McTominay has become Manchester United’s unlikely saviour is testament to Erik ten Hag’s ability to resurrect once unsalvageable careers, and isn’t that the DNA of a Champions-League qualifying team?",
      "McTominay’s game-winning header against Aston Villa was not only the latest episode in the Scotland international’s redemption arc but evidence of United’s ability to find ways to win. Also: Manchester United + super-subs = winning!",
      "The other way of looking at this is United’s undying reliance on McTominay to pop up with crucial goals (his seven goals have given Ten Hag’s side an additional 12 points, the most by any player in the Premier League, without which United would be stewing in 12th) points to a raft of weaknesses.",
      "Once again, United failed to kill off a match, succumbing to a lack of control and needing to overload the box late on to save themselves. If they are to bridge the gap to the top five, that habit needs fixing, and fast. Until then, it’s apparently super-sub Scott McTominay to the rescue.",
      "United's hopes of Champions League football next term rest on how many places English clubs are granted in the next edition of the competition.",
      "If it's four, I think Erik ten Hag's men will come up short, given three are almost certainly going to be occupied by Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal. The idea of United managing to leapfrog BOTH Tottenham and Aston Villa between now and May is far-fetched given their own defensive frailties.",
      "However, if a fifth-placed Champions League qualification then United could sneak in. Spurs have a history of struggling to hold their nerve, while Arsenal fans will confirm Unai Emery's record when the going gets tough and the stakes are high isn't fantastic either.",

      "Leading from the back and, in one crucial moment against Aston Villa, leading from the front. It might be old school but Maguire’s mountainous presence remains a valuable attacking asset for club and country.",
      "Remember World Cup 2018? In the early stages of that tournament, Maguire was performing media duties at England’s remote training camp in a place named Repino on the Gulf of Finland.",
      "Bored and resigned to a fringe role in the squad, Jamie Vardy popped along to have a nose around and was in typically waggish mood, joining the reporters who were talking to Maguire.",
      "“It’s Jamie Vardy here from the Vardy Express,” he chimed. “How big is the diameter of your head?” Vardy then revealed he had given his Leicester City team-mate the uncomplicated nickname of Slab Head.",
      "And in the days and weeks that followed, Maguire’s head became an important factor in England’s progression to an agonising semi-final loss to Croatia in Moscow.",
      "The header that sticks in the memory was the thumping effort from a good 10 yards out that gave England the lead against Sweden in the quarter-final. But just as crucial was Maguire’s aerial assist for Harry Kane’s late winner in the opening game against Tunisia.",
      "Maguire’s latest aerial assist came in the United victory at Villa Park, his wonderfully-controlled header giving Rasmus Hojlund a straightforward task.",
      "That was one of seven aerial duels contested by Maguire in United’s third successive Premier League win - and he won all seven, including one just before half-time that almost certainly averted a Villa equaliser.",
      "So, while the injury to Lisandro Martinez - likely to be out until April at the earliest with knee ligament damage - is a major blow for Erik ten Hag, Maguire’s presence will give him that extra measure of attacking threat from set-pieces.",
      "Maguire scored seven goals in his first 41 games for England and Gareth Southgate will hope the United defender can recapture that sort of scoring form at Euro 2024.",
      "Fitness permitting, Maguire will be there, that is for sure. Southgate has never lost faith in him and Ten Hag now appears to be finding some faith in him.",
      "Watched by the England manager, Maguire was outstanding against Villa, winning four out of four tackles and four out of five ground duels to also prove his capabilities on the deck.",
      "The idea that Ten Hag wanted Maguire to leave the club - and it was an open secret that he did - now seems like a preposterous one, the 30-year-old from Sheffield being the most dependable and the best centre-half Ten Hag has at his disposal right now.",
      "And as Unai Emery and Aston Villa found to their cost on Sunday, Maguire could yet produce moments upfront that might help United earn Champions League football after all.",

      "The Champions League will be revamped for next season with 36 clubs taking part - four more than usual - and that could increase English participation.",
      "Of the additional four, two of those places will go to the leagues who have performed the best across all three European competitions this season. It all comes down to coefficient points - effectively UEFA's way of determining which leagues are doing the best across all their tournaments.",
      "Points are handed out for wins and draws, effectively pitting the leagues against each other, and the picture will change again this week with the knockout stages in the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League all beginning. The more teams your country has doesn't necessarily increase your ranking though, as it is determined on averages.",
      "For example, the Czech Republic, whilst their clubs aren't perhaps considered the most competitive, have an average of 12 points and sit fifth in this season's coefficient - above the likes of France. The Czech clubs only have 48 points, but that is split between four teams. Ligue 1 clubs might have racked up 69.5 points, but that's split between six teams, giving them an average of 11.5 points.",
      "This year England began with eight teams in European football - four in the Champions League, three in the Europa League and one in the Europa Conference League. That is now down to six with Newcastle United and Manchester United getting dumped out of the top tier competition.",
      "However, as explained previously, English teams have actually amassed more points that their rivals from Italy and Germany. (England 109, Italy 98, Germany 95.5). However there were only seven teams from Italy and Germany competing, so once you do the average per team they sit higher than the English.",

      "One issue is that some teams - albeit not the English ones - will play the knockout playoff round in the Europa League and the Europa Conference League this week and next. It means points can be added to the national association score, but not every club gets that chance.",
      "So while you gain more bonus points for winning a group - something Liverpool, West Ham and Brighton did in the Europa League, and Aston Villa did in the Conference League - rather than finishing second, the runners-up are capable of adding greater points because they will feature in the knockout playoff round, whilst all group winners go straight into the last 16.",
      "To make it real, Europa League group winners get four bonus points, and the runners-up get two bonus points. But the runners-up play in the knockout playoff round with an additional four points available through the results of each leg, if they win both matches.",
      "English teams, especially in the Champions League, will be chuffed with their ties. Not least because they've avoided their rivals. Arsenal take on Porto with defending European champions City facing Danish side Copenhagen.",
      "Italy, Germany and Spain - who are the three main threats to the England teams - have found themselves facing each other, which could see them taking coefficient points off each other. Inter Milan take on Atletico Madrid, Napoli face Barcelona, RB Leipzig will be against Real Madrid and Lazio have been drawn against Bayern Munich.",
      "Basic points",
      "2 - win",
      "1 - win in qualifying and play-off matches",

      "1 - SF, final",

Lens, Marseille, Rennes and Toulouse are all in action with PSG and Lille already into the last 16 of their respective tournaments.",
      "But it is the fifth spot that could prove crucial. Champions League is crucial for United whilst it would be massive for Villa's development. Work still needs to be done by the English teams in Europe if they are to jump up a spot in the coefficient rankings.",
      "City will be fancied to go far and potentially defend their title. But it is in the other two tournaments that the Premier League sides could really make inroads. With the bookies City, Liverpool and Villa are the favourites to win their respective competitions, which would mean an English clean sweep. If that happens, a fifth team from England will almost certainly be in the Champions League.",

Villa's Brazilian midfielder levelled from close range and celebrated with a dance in front of United's Raphael Varane and Andre Onana.

      "Roy Keane has questioned Gary Neville 's decision to name Harry Maguire as his Player of the Match in Manchester United's crucial 2-1 victory over Aston Villa.",
      "Maguire started alongside Raphael Varane in central defence at Villa Park and the England international impressed as United boosted their chances of qualifying for the Champions League. Scott McTominay struck an 86th-minute winner for the Red Devils after Douglas Luiz cancelled out Rasmus Hojlund's opener.",
      "The result moves United to within six points of fourth-placed Tottenham and five behind Villa in fifth as the race for the Champions League intensifies. Erik ten Hag's side have also won their last three Premier League matches and are in a strong position to push for a place in Europe's elite club competition.",
      "As the game was petering towards the full-time whistle, Neville picked Maguire as his Player of the Match - but it's safe to say Keane didn't agree with that decision. \"I thought he did alright today, obviously some lads give defenders Man of the Match because they've been defenders themselves - that type of scenario. It was definitely going to be a defender,\" Keane said on Sky Sports.",
      "When quizzed on who he would have picked instead of Maguire, Keane continued: \"No big deal about that but we've praised the defenders considered the amount of chances Villa had.",
      "\"Winning Man of the Match the bottom line is it's no big deal, what's important for Maguire is he's getting games under his belt and he's getting back up to speed. He's a good, solid, experienced defender. The problems are still there for Man United, they got away with it today because the attacking players are scoring goals.\"",
      "The win could be significant in United's season and Ten Hag was delighted to get the three points over the line. The Dutchman said in his post-match press conference: \"It was massive. It's a massive win for us. So, we get closer. And that was the aim for today and was absolutely our target. And we did it.",
      "\"I think also the way we did it, I think I liked it, and of course, I liked especially the first 20 minutes. And when we are dictating the game, after I think we are dropping a little bit too much. We had our moments in the counter attacks, but yeah, I think then at 1-1, to fight back, we are really happy for today.\"",

      "Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz appeared to celebrate in front of Andre Onana after equalising against Manchester United as Rio Ferdinand delivered his verdict",
      "Rio Ferdinand has poked fun at Douglas Luiz after Manchester United's 2-1 win at Aston Villa.",
      "Scott McTominay scored a 86th minute winner for Erik ten Hag's side after Luiz had cancelled out Rasmus Hojlund's opener. The travelling United faithful were jubilant after the final whistle as they acknowledged the significance of the victory in the race for the Champions League places.",
      "However, United could have been even more motivated to topple Villa following Luiz's provocative celebration. After firing beyond Andre Onana, Luiz decided to roar in front of the Cameroonian, before executing a shoulder shimmy. Luiz then teared off towards the Holte end, but was pulled back by John McGinn as Villa looked to win the game.",
      "And Ferdinand decided to take aim at Luiz after the final whistle as United closed the gap on the top four to six points. The ex-United centre-back posted an image of Luiz performing a knee slide after scoring and tagged the midfielder on X. He wrote: \"You ok @dgoficial?\" It was followed by four laughing emojis.",
      "Meanwhile, Erik ten Hag was quizzed on Luiz's celebration in his post-match press conference and admitted it may have motivated his players to win the match. He said: \"I don’t have an opinion on it.",
      "\"I haven’t spoken to the players. It may have fuelised (fuelled) the players. I don’t know. We have to think about our game. Not about the opposition. We always want to control the game and dictate it. That should be our approach.\"",
      "His celebration wasn't Luiz's only talking point from the game as the Brazilian was involved in an altercation with Hojlund as the Denmark international left the pitch in the final couple of minutes. The United ace was in no rush to leave the pitch after being substituted and that incensed Luiz, who went over to grab his opponent and usher him off.",
      "The win is United's third on the bounce in the Premier League as they look to mount a serious challenge in their hopes for Champions League qualification. \"It was massive,\" Ten Hag said on the meaning of the Red Devils' win. \"It's a massive win for us. So, we get closer. And that was the aim for today and was absolutely our target.",
      "\"We did it. And I think also the way we did it, I think I liked it, and of course, I liked especially the first 20 minutes. And when we are dictating the game, after I think we are dropping a little bit too much.

      "United are undefeated in 2024, they have won three games on the bounce in the league and Rasmus Hojlund has five goals in as many games. The spring flowers will bloom soon, the lighter nights will arrive and there is genuine reason for optimism if you're a United fan.",
      "The first half of the season was bleak and it was a winter of discontent, but results have improved and there is hope Erik ten Hag's side can enjoy a strong end to the campaign.",
      "United are currently in sixth position in the table and it would be a shock if they finished lower than that. Newcastle, West Ham, Brighton and Chelsea are the chasing pack but those four clubs have been inconsistent this season and are unlikely to secure a finish in the top six places.",
      "The Reds have 41 points, Aston Villa have 46 and Tottenham sit on 47. Spurs are the bookies' favourites to finish in fourth place but they face competition from United and Villa.",
      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal are in a title race and seem guaranteed to occupy the top three positions, which leaves just one place for Champions League qualification up for grabs.",
      "That could change, as two leagues will be rewarded with an extra Champions League place for next season, but they are going to Italy and Germany as things stand.",
      "However, there's barely anything between Italy, Germany and England on the coefficient ranking system and Spain are not far behind, which means who gets the extra places will be decided by the performance of teams from each country in the knockout rounds of the competitions.",
      "For example, the further teams from England progress in the Conference League, Europa League and the Champions League, the more likely an extra place in the Premier League will be.",
      "Regardless, the priority for United during the remainder of the season is to finish in the top four and already crashing out of European competition should give them an advantage.",
      "United have rarely been knocked out of Europe before Christmas and, after exiting from the Carabao Cup in the early rounds, the fixture list looks kind in the next few months.",
      "Two games per week is normal for United, who intend to compete in four competitions, but the majority of the midweeks are fixture-free from now until the end of the campaign.",
      "At the moment, there are just two weeks in the next three months when United play twice, although that could change if they progress into the latter rounds of the FA Cup.",
      "Even if they do, most of the weeks will remain without a midweek fixture and that should be a huge benefit as the team recovers, prepares and trains at Carrington for the next match.",
      "The load on the players will be easier to manage and fewer injuries should occur. United have close to a fully fit squad and should be able to operate with their best players starting games.",
      "Luke Shaw was substituted as a precaution on Sunday and is being assessed. He is expected to be fit for Luton Town, but if a midweek fixture was in the schedule, he would likely be absent.",
      "There are also obvious tactical benefits to not having a midweek fixture because Ten Hag has more time on the training ground to convey his message, work with the players and prepare.",
      "After failing to qualify for Europe last season, Tottenham are in the same boat, but Aston Villa are still in the Conference League and that's an opportunity for 'meaningful' silverware.",
      "Unai Emery's focus is not just on the league and he'll have a busier schedule to contend with, whereas United can 'treat every game like a cup final', as Ten Hag keeps reiterating.",

      "European vs Brit. Attack vs defence. Mourinho vs Solskjaer. But it is Erik ten Hag who has settled on an outcome to Man United's right-back duel.",
      "Diogo Dalot has picked his moments for assists this season. The first teed up Alejandro Garnacho for the goal of the season and the second invited Scott McTominay to resume his matchwinner mode.",
      "Dalot's centre for McTominay was billed as a \"David Beckham cross\" by Paul Merson in the Villa Park studio. Dalot has tallied a modest nine assists for United and Sunday's was his finest.",
      "\"I think I have the ability to do it,\" Dalot said in the mixed zone. \"I still think I can get even more, so hopefully in the future.\"",
      "The United website queried whether Dalot is in the form of his life. He isn't. That was in his first months under Erik ten Hag when he started all but one match (missed through suspension) and sustained that momentum at the World Cup. Dalot ousted Joao Cancelo from the Portugal team in Qatar.",
      "Dalot's whipped cross against Aston Villa possibly closes the chapter on the five-year right-back battle at Manchester United. Dalot is nearing the performance level of the first third of last season whereas Aaron Wan-Bissaka has gone missing again.",
      "When Dalot was firmly cemented at right-back last term, Wan-Bissaka was absent for 10 successive Premier League matches. Now he has a problem with his leg.",
      "He is unlikely to be given a leg up. Wan-Bissaka, who withdrew from United's training session on Thursday, is out of contract next year. Dalot signed a new contract last year. Wan-Bissaka is sidelined and Dalot is starting.",
      "United have room for improvement at right-back and Wan-Bissaka is the obvious makeweight. United were prepared to sell him in Ten Hag's first summer.",
      "Jose Mourinho bought Dalot for £19million in 2018 and a year later United agreed a £50m fee with Crystal Palace for Wan-Bissaka. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer peculiarly favoured British recruits, a strategy that was abandoned as early as his second transfer window.",
      "Wan-Bissaka played 46 times for Palace before he became an automatic pick at United, where he drew acclaim for his sliding tackles and, in particular, his one-sided duels with the Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling.",
      "Dalot had such an injury-ravaged season in 2019-20 he played only 11 times but the nadir came when he was fit. With left-backs Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams both injured, Dalot was expected to start away to Palace on account of his versatility. Instead, Solskjaer resurrected Timothy Fosu-Mensah for his first United appearance in over three years. Dalot only got a look-in when Solskjaer picked a heavily-rotated team to face Norwich in the FA Cup quarter-final.",
      "With Wan-Bissaka a certain starter, Dalot secured a season-long loan to AC Milan in October 2020. Wan-Bissaka started in all 15 of United's Champions League and Europa League games and in 34 of their 38 Premier League matches (Solskjaer rested regulars for two of those games to prioritise the Europa League) that season.",
      "Yet Wan-Bissaka had not improved on an impressive first season. Teams started to target his doziness at the far post and two goals and six assists were flattering numbers. United also proved to be one of the most misleading teams in the fake football era of crowdless stadia.",
      "In summer 2021, United wanted Kieran Trippier and Bury-born Trippier wanted United, but Atletico Madrid priced him out of a homecoming. Dalot had spent a steady and, crucially, injury-free season at Milan that ended with an 11th-hour call-up to the Portugal squad for the European Championship. Dalot made his debut against France in the group stage and started in the round-of-16 defeat to Belgium.",
      "With Dalot's stock rising, United fielded enquiries. Milan were interested in re-signing him while Borussia Dortmund touched base. Any move was blocked when United failed to make headway with Trippier.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was still Solskjaer's man. Dalot's only starts under the Norwegian in 2021-22 were in the League Cup third round defeat to West Ham and the fortuitous Champions League group stage win against Villarreal when he was run ragged by Arnaut Danjuma.",
      "Solskjaer quipped to a United staff member afterwards, \"It's a shame Diogo can't f-----g defend.\" Dalot creditably fronted up for a virtual mixed zone chat.",
      "With United still keeping tabs on Trippier on the assumption his valuation would decrease in the 2022 January window, Roma - now coached by Mourinho - expressed interest in Dalot.",
      "Only United had started to spiral, shipping four goals at Leicester, five to Liverpool and another four at Watford within five weeks. Solskjaer apologetically raised his hand to the away end at Vicarage Road. It also signalled his goodbye and he filmed a tearful exit interview the next day.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was in the midst of a personal downward spiral but caretaker manager Michael Carrick favoured continuity in the back four. The turning point came in Carrick's second match in the manager's seat when Wan-Bissaka suffered a hand injury in the draw at Chelsea.",
      "Dalot was recalled against Arsenal four days later for what was his first Premier League start in 788 days. United won with interim manager Ralf Rangnick watching in the stands.",
      "For the first time, Dalot was the favoured pick at right-back over Wan-Bissaka, who started in only one of Rangnick's first 13 matches in the dugout. Dalot started in 22 of United's 29 games under Rangnick, who favoured more intense and front-footed characters.",
      "For Dalot, the season was progressive in that his playing time had soared. He played in 30 games having appeared in 34 in his previous full seasons with United. He was also a fixture in the Portugal squad. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive Englishman who has never played for England.",
      "United received more enquiries about Dalot but informed interested parties the right-back they wanted to cash in on was Wan-Bissaka in the summer of 2022. Ten Hag replaced Rangnick and brought with him Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, instrumental to the Latino rebranding of the United defence. Dalot tallied with the grinta - grit or determination - of Martinez, Casemiro and one-time Madridista Raphael Varane.",
      "Such was United's weak position in the transfer market there were no takers for Wan-Bissaka. With the summer transfer window open for only a few more days, United briefed Wan-Bissaka would be staying.",
      "Wan-Bissaka had four minutes of playing time under Ten Hag before the World Cup interrupted the club calendar in November. Dalot sustained a hamstring injury in Portugal's quarter-final defeat to Morocco and Wan-Bissaka marked his return for United with a rare assist against Burnley in the League Cup fourth round.",
      "For the next six months, Wan-Bissaka had the momentum. Dalot suffered a recurrence of his hamstring strain in the League Cup quarter-final against Charlton Athletic and he was hooked at half-time in the League Cup final after Allan Saint-Maximin rode roughshod over him. Wan-Bissaka came on and Saint-Maximin hit a force field.",
      "Wan-Bissaka performed creditably in the second half of last season and he was United's only acceptable performer when they went down with a fight to Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Dalot was an unused substitute and began this season on the bench.",
      "During pre-season in the United States, Ten Hag had still not settled on his right-back for the season opener against Wolves. Wan-Bissaka lined up in the first two matches against Arsenal and Real Madrid but Dalot returned with a goal against Dortmund in Las Vegas.",
      "United returned home and back at Old Trafford, Dalot's careless pass inadvertently assisted Florian Sotoca's audacious lob over Andre Onana. The next day, Wan-Bissaka contributed to a last-minute equaliser for Facundo Pellistri in Dublin.",
      "Wan-Bissaka started this season as he ended last season - as United's best player. That was all too brief as he succumbed to a hamstring injury against Brighton in September.",
      "Dalot has been injury-free all season. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, he has extraordinarily missed only eight out of a possible 192 games through injury.",
      "Both full-backs have started in the same XI nine times this season amid Tyrell Malacia's interminable absence with a knee problem and Luke Shaw's brittleness. Each has shown admirable resilience at stages of their United career. Wan-Bissaka has overcome homesickness and plans to jettison him.",
      "But Dalot has always had the edge under Ten Hag. 74 of his 139 appearances for United have come under the Dutchman whereas Wan-Bissaka has played 51 times for the incumbent United manager.",
      "Wan-Bissaka has always been the more secure defender and Dalot the more accomplished attacker. Wilfried Zaha has tormented Dalot for Palace and Galatasaray yet was denied a one-on-one with David de Gea by Wan-Bissaka last season.",
      "\"I had a little look back and I thought, 'Oh my God, it's Aaron,'\" Zaha lamented. \"He's the only one who can do the scoop tackle.\" James Maddison was so in awe of Wan-Bissaka's marshalling of Brighton livewire Kaoru Mitoma during last season's FA Cup semi-final he tweeted, \"AWB is ridiculously good at 1 v 1 defending. Probably the best in the world bar none. So many wingers run out of ideas when playing directly against him.\"",
      "Yet right-backs are judged on their attacking output and Wan-Bissaka is as shy at attacking as he is at speaking. Wan-Bissaka had to \"pick up on the coaching\", in Ten Hag's words last January.",
      "Dalot executed a couple of sliding interventions reminiscent of Wan-Bissaka in the first half at Villa Park on Sunday. He then bent it like Beckham in the second half.",

      "Andre Onana was praised for his performance in Manchester Utd's win over Aston Villa but he still divided opinion.",
      "For the second season in succession, a Manchester United goalkeeper could win the Golden Glove award. For the second season in succession, they are also dividing opinions.",
      "Andre Onana earned plenty of praise for his performance in United's weekend win over Aston Villa, but at the same time, he also drew some criticism for his divisive style of play.",
      "How you rate Onana depends on what you judge a goalkeeper's job to be. If it was just to keep the ball out of the back of the net, then he did that with eight saves in total on Sunday afternoon, five of which were inside the box.",
      "CHAMPIONS LEAGUE HOPES: United handed huge injury update that could swing Premier League top four race",
      "But if that is the trait that reigns supreme, then is he really an upgrade on David de Gea? Onana was signed to be an improvement on the Spaniard shot-stopper, yet all he has really done is emulate him in his debut campaign.",
      "Onana catches the eye for his reactionary stops, no matter how unorthodox they might be, yet he has been exposed all season for limited distribution and an uncertainty brought to the entire defensive line.",
      "The quirk is that the Cameroonian still sits second in the race for the Golden Glove award in the Premier League, though you only have to watch how United play to realise he is not the second-best goalkeeper in the league.",
      "What further muddies the perception of him are the statistics that can be twisted to fit whatever narrative you wish. Onana has kept as many clean sheets as Alisson Becker in three appearances more, but then again, he has been part of a dysfunctional defence that changes most weeks. He has made more saves than both Becker and clean sheet leader Jordan Pickford, but he has conceded more goals as well.",
      "It is difficult to fairly compare goalkeepers given the varying circumstances they perform in, and perhaps a more relevant one regards the specific trait he was signed to strengthen.",
      "Erik ten Hag targeted the signing of Onana in the summer, not only for his shot-stopping ability but also because of the distributional skills he was supposed to bring to the side.",
      "Yet he is averaging fewer passes per match than both Alisson and Pickford and sits at just seventh place for the most passes by a goalkeeper in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "This was opitimised at Villa Park when Onana awkwardly attempted to pass out from the back to Victor Lindelof, who lost possession and gifted Ollie Watkins a shot at goal, which was saved well. Onana was putting out fires all afternoon, but some of them were acts of arson in the first place.",
      "Another area of his game that has been unconvincing has been his positioning. He started the corner that resulted in Villa's goal in an unfavourable position, failed to reach the cross, and made a save before Douglas Luiz beat him a few seconds later. This was a De Gea esque performance in which fine saves masked underlying areas of concern.",
      "Again, you have to look at the bigger picture. Onana is still very much a work in progress, and there is hope he will get even better once he is playing behind a settled back-four, a luxury he has rarely been afforded. Yet at the same time, United spent £47.2 million on him in the summer window, and he hasn't been that much of an upgrade of De Gea, if even one at all.",
      "Onana deserves more credit than criticism for his performance at Villa Park, but it is in the wake of triumph that the most brutal reflection is required.",

      "Keep across all the latest Manchester United transfer news this Tuesday afternoon as we await INEOS' Premier League ratification",
      "Manchester United are awaiting the arrival of INEOS founder Sir Jim Ratcliffe this week as his takeover is set to receive ratification from the Premier League.",
      "Ratcliffe announced on Christmas Eve he would be arriving at Old Trafford and taking over the football side of the project. However, his official arrival was delayed by the Premier League's ratification process.",
      "While Ratcliffe is understood to have been attending meetings last week, the INEOS era is expected to begin in full when the Premier League gives the green light. One of their top priorities will be signings and Bayer Leverkusen defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba are on their radar.",
      "Follow all of the very latest United news, views and transfer updates via the blog below:",
      "INEOS founder Ratcliffe has received regulatory approval from the Premier League for his investment in United.",
      "United are now awaiting approval from the FA but this process is believed to be proceeding positively.",
      "The deadline for the tender offer to Class A shareholders has been extended from February 14 to February 16.",
      "During the midst of the takeover uncertainty, the share price was considered a key factor in determining the likelihood of the sale being completed.",
      "When it rises, a deal is thought to be more likely because the markets are backing the club to flourish from fresh investment.",
      "This recent rise following Ratcliffe's announcement means the New York Stock Exchange has been reassured by Ratcliffe's decision to extend his deadline.",
      "Welcome back to the United transfer blog on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "My name is Jack and I will be keeping you across the latest Reds news until 4pm.",
      "First up, we will be discussing the United takeover with the club's stock price positively effected thanks to Ratcliffe's decision to extend his offer deadline until the end of the week.",
      "Former United striker Louis Saha has waxed lyrical about right-back Diogo Dalot following his performance in yesterday's 2-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "The Portuguese international provided a pinpoint cross in the closing stages, enabling substitute Scott McTominay to head home a dramatic winner with time running out.",
      "Saha told Betfred:",
      "\"He will always have to prove it because there’s good competition for his spot. This season for me, he's shown that he's a quality player, especially going forward and he's improving when it comes to his defensive duties. The potential is there, he's playing for his country as well, and nowadays, there's a lot of demands on players in his position and Diogo is helping his forwards find the confidence they need too. Against Aston Villa, he put in the kind of performance that can help the whole team improve and congratulations to him, but this is just the start for him because he has to restart next week and the week after. It will be tough, but that's part of the challenge and I’m sure he’s looking forward to it.\"",
      "Following the sharp rise of Kobbie Mainoo, question marks surround how Mason Mount forces his way back into United's strongest XI once he has returned from his current injury.",
      "The midfielder was signed from Chelsea last summer to provide control and energy in the deep-lying No.8 position. However, injury issues and Mainoo's development have meant he has been unable to stamp his authority at Old Trafford, as Senior Football Writer George Smith has explained:",
      "\"Though Mason Mount has cited the No.8 role as his best, he is also capable of playing in the No.10 position, meaning he could offer rotational support and backup for Bruno Fernandes. United do not currently have a backup attacking-midfielder who specialises in playing as an out-and-out No.10. Donny van de Beek is supposedly an attacking-midfielder, but he is highly unlikely to play for United again after leaving on loan for a second time last month. Having someone of Mount's talent, as he has displayed in the Premier League several times in recent years, is not a bad thing for United, but it could see a £60m signing tied to a backup role.\"",
      "According to a report by FootballTransfers, United are in 'pole position' to sign Bayern Munich centre-back Matthijs de Ligt ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "We brought you a report coming out of Germany earlier, claiming De Ligt is 'not 100 per cent happy' with his current situation at Bayern. He has not played as regularly as he would have liked this term, playing 16 times.",
      "He worked with United manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax and is vastly experienced, despite only being 24. United plan to sign a new centre-back ahead of the 2024/25 season.",
      "He is also being linked with a move to Arsenal.",
      "\"But United are still living on their wits. There is a sense that their biggest weapon over the last few weeks has been their character, a refusal to cave and a willingness to fight that was perhaps also missing before the New Year. It helps to have experienced players back. Casemiro is key in that regard, as is Raphael Varane. Harry Maguire’s leadership is to the fore once again after rediscovering his best form. At Villa Park, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes were a spiky and combative midfield pair, arguing with the opposition and referee Robert Jones. But there is more to it than that. Hojlund has shown the right attitude all season but that is only growing now he is in the goals. Witness his reaction to being subbed in injury time and the way he sought to waste time and wind people up. He relishes the battle across 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo is the baby of this team, but the 18-year-old is holding his own in terms of technique and temperament in midfield.\"",
      "Following yesterday's 2-1 win at Villa Park, United have considerably boosted their chances of securing a top four finish this season. They are now just six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "With their current run of form boosting confidence levels, do you think United will be back in the Champions League next term? You can have your say via the poll below.",
      "According to a report by Defensa Central, Real Madrid's chief scout, Juni Calafat, has been asked to 'keep a close eye' on United striker Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "After a slow start to life at Old Trafford, the Dane scored his 11th goal of the season in yesterday's 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park. He has now scored in each of his last five Premier League games.",
      "It is reported that Calafat was 'watching' Hojlund prior to his move to United from Atalanta last August. He is being linked with a move to Madrid if their plan to sign either Kylian Mbappe or Erling Haaland fails.",
      "The report adds that if Hojlund is to be considered as the answer to 'Plan B', he must maintain his current hot-streak.",
      "2024 has been kind to United thus far. Yesterday's 2-1 win over Aston Villa marked a fifth win in six games since the turn of the year.",
      "\"If the precautionary withdrawal means Luke Shaw misses Luton and Fulham but he is fit for the FA Cup tie at Nottingham Forest and Manchester derby on March 3 then so be it. Without Lisandro Martinez, Erik ten Hag paired Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire for the first time in the Premier League. Maguire was the man of the match at Villa and Varane was key again.\"",
      "Championship clubs Birmingham City and Watford are 'lining up' offers to take United winger Amad on loan next season, according to a report by The Sun.",
      "The Ivorian was linked with returning to Sunderland in last month's transfer window, but United have retained him for their own use for the remainder of this season. He spent last season on loan at Sunderland and excelled, scoring 14 goals.",
      "Amad has since been heavily linked with a return to the second tier, with Birmingham and Watford now being linked with his signature. Birmingham are managed by Tony Mowbray, who was in charge of Sunderland for the duration of Amad's time at the Stadium of Light.",
      "AS Monaco and Marseille are 'showing interest' in signing United forward Anthony Martial ahead of this summer's transfer window, according to a report by The Sun.",

      "Netherlands international Matthijs de Ligt is 'not 100 per cent happy' at Bayern Munich amid reports linking him with a move to United, according to a report by Bild, as cited by 90min.",
      "The centre-back, who worked with United manager Erik ten Hag at Ajax, has been linked with a move to Old Trafford recently. United plan to strengthen their defensive options with the addition of a new centre-back this forthcoming summer.",
      "De Ligt, 24, has struggled for regular minutes this season, playing just 16 times in all competitions for Bayern.",
      "United are on a roll right now, aren't they? Yesterday's 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park marked a third successive Premier League win and fourth on the bounce in all competitions.",
      "Like last week, United have a clear midweek to prepare for this coming weekend's Premier League fixture, which will see them travel to Kenilworth Road to face Luton Town. United will fancy their chances of using that as an opportunity to maintain their impressive run.",

      "Both Frimpong, who is a right-back, and Tapsoba, who is a centre-back, have played key roles in Leverkusen's outstanding Bundesliga campaign thus far. Saturday's 3-0 win over Bayern Munich moved Xabi Alonso's side five points clear at the top of the table.",
      "Frimpong, who scored against Bayern, has made 27 appearances this season, while Tapsoba has played 25 times.",

      "England defender Luke Shaw was taken off as a precautionary measure at half-time. Relegation-threatened Luton Town are next up for Ten Hag's side on Sunday (4.30pm), so there will hopefully be sufficient time for Shaw and others to recover.",

      "Erik ten Hag explained his thinking HERE",
      "Scott McTominay's late header gave Manchester United a priceless three points at Aston Villa. to close the gap to a possible Champions League place to five points.",
      "United had gone in front in the 17th minute when Rasmus Hojlund poked home from close range. But the home side were always a threat and were deserving of their second-half equaliser through Douglas Luiz.",
      "Villa had further chances - Andre Onana had made some fine saves to keep them out in the first half - but McTominay proved to be the matchwinner.",
      "Erik ten Hag has explained Luke Shaw was taken off as a 'precaution' at half-time in the win against Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Shaw has already suffered thigh and muscular injuries this season and many feared the worst when he was substituted for Victor Lindelof at half-time.",
      "The Manchester United boss said: \"Was precaution, Luke Shaw, he gave some messages about complaints. With Luke Shaw, we know his history with too many injuries and we couldn't go into that risk. A very important game but we can't miss him for six weeks.\"",

      "Reinforcements in attack, in midfield and in central defence are being spied, while right-back is also a position due to be addressed. Diogo Dalot’s contract does not run out until 2028 but Aaron Wan-Bissaka could be on the move.",
      "The 26-year-old recently had his year-long contract extension triggered but perhaps only so he can be sold for a fee this summer. United held talks with Frimpong last year and MEN Sport understands that he is still on Erik ten Hag’s shortlist.",
      "Frimpong came through the ranks at Man City but decided to leave for Celtic in 2019, where he won the Scottish domestic treble in 2020 before leaving for Bayer Leverkusen in January 2021. “I wanted first-team football and if that wasn’t coming at City then it had to be somewhere else,” he said of his exit from the Etihad Stadium.",
      "“It wasn’t easy for me leaving, I’d been there all my life. But I had to try it. If you are passionate and serious about football, you can’t be staying the same.”",
      "Ten Hag will hope that his career stance will encourage him to make a move to Old Trafford amid huge interest in the Netherlands international. Frimpong has largely played as wing-back under Xabi Alonso and has drummed up some impressive stats.",

      "DOB: December 10, 2000 (23 years old)",
      "Height: 1.71m",
      "Nationality: The Netherlands (1 cap, 0 goals)",
      "Current club: Bayer Leverkusen",
      "Squad number: 30",
      "Market value: €50million / £42.6million (according to Transfermarkt)",
      "His impressive stoppage-time goal in Saturday’s 3-0 win over Bundesliga title challengers Bayern Munich on Saturday takes his tally to eight for the season, in addition to his 10 assists. He looks set to beat last season’s record of nine goals and 11 assists.",
      "The 23-year-old will not be an easy grab for any club, given a bidding war could ensue on a player who signed a fresh five-year deal in October. However, with Alonso potentially heading for the hot seat at Liverpool, Frimpong may be one player who exits with him.",
      "Alonso nor the player himself have recently spoken about Frimpong’s future but amid speculation about an exit last year, his manager insisted the defender is not the type to be distracted by transfer talk.",
      "Alonso said: “I talk to him a lot and he is 100 percent focused on Bayer Leverkusen. If it wasn't like that, I would talk to him. But it's not a problem for anyone. He has the hunger to improve and help the team.”",
      "Frimpong has a market valuation of €50m (£42.6m), according to Transfermarkt.

      "McTominay has developed a habit of scoring goals and his powerful header to win the game against Aston Villa might be his most important of the season because it gives hope that qualifying for Champions League football is possible, despite an awful first half of the campaign.",

      "\"Scott is the same when he's not starting, but he's ready for every minute and we have to credit him for this mentality. He's an example because he's always ready to contribute to the team.",

      "Ten Hag has gone from placing McTominay on the transfer list to saying he is 'so pleased' to have him in his squad, which probably shouldn't be a surprise given his contribution.",
      "McTominay has eight goals in all competitions and seven of those have been in the Premier League, meaning he's scored more than in his previous three campaigns combined (six).",
      "In another world, McTominay would be playing in claret and blue and supporters are relieved he is not. His goals have been huge and he's become a talismanic presence.",
      "McTominay scored a brace against Brentford in October to win 2-1, he scored twice against Chelsea in December in another 2-1 victory and the same scoreline was seen against Villa.",
      "Those wins represent nine points and they would have produced a point (a draw against Villa) without McTominay's goals. United would be on 33 points and sitting in ninth position.",
      "In reality, United have 41 points and they're in sixth position. The difference is stark and Ten Hag might have lost his job without a handful of crucial interventions from McTominay.",
      "McTominay is in the best goalscoring form of his career and it's no fluke. He was also prolific for Scotland throughout Euro 2024 qualifying, scoring seven goals (one behind Harry Kane and two behind Kylian Mbappe) as his nation qualified for this summer's tournament in Germany.",
      "The 27-year-old plays an advanced midfield role for Scotland and there was always a feeling he was a square peg in a round hole when starting in a double pivot with Fred.",
      "McTominay's limitations playing as a deeper midfielder are no secret but his strengths in attacking scenarios are equally impossible to ignore. His goals are worth their weight in gold.",
      "Gary Neville made a comparison between McTominay and Marouane Fellaini on Sunday night and he's not the first to make that point this season. Fellaini became an unlikely hero at United and he thrived coming off the bench, dominating in the box and scoring late, important goals.",
      "From scoring in the Manchester derby to helping United reach the FA Cup final and producing late, match-winning headers in the league, Fellaini knew where the net was.",

His pace on the counterattack gave United a number of threatening opportunities; he dropped deep to help with the defensive phases, and his pressing play forced Douglas Luiz into a mistake that almost gave his side the lead.",

We could have maybe defended it a bit better, but I know unfortunately that Scotty [McTominay] is great at coming in at that stage.",
      "\"We've got to remember how far we've come as a team and a club. It's my job to make sure we stick together. We've come a long way. We're still in a great position to achieve something special. If we play like that today we'll win more games than we lose.",
      "\"I could feel us winning it [in the second half]. We had chances on the break, they were breaking but not creating chances.",
      "\"They had moments of quality, we were getting into great positions. We stuck to the game plan. Our supporters were getting a bit frustrated, but I think they wanted us to be up and at them. I think on another day we win this this game.",
      "\"We're at a big club, the fans are expecting. We are expecting that. It's my job to keep the team together. We don't want to blame everyone. These things happen in a season.",
      "\"We've had huge injuries throughout the season, it's gone under the radar and the manager doesn't make excuses. We can still achieve something special this season and today was a massive step towards that.\"",

      "Man United have a fine record in Saturday 12.30pm kick-offs under Erik ten Hag but West Ham away proves to be one of the toughest.",
      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

      "There have been more recent photos of Jadon Sancho at social events than of him playing football.",
      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",

Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",

      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",

      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",

Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Ivory Coast striker Sebastien Haller scored the winner in the AFCON final against Nigeria just hours after Erik ten Hag had guided Manchester United to a win over Aston Villa in the Premier League",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag has revealed that he reached out to Sebastien Haller, his former player, to congratulate him on his winning goal for Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Ten Hag, who worked with Haller early in his career at Utrecht and later signed him for Ajax, has been a strong support for the player during his fight against testicular cancer.",
      "After Haller scored the decisive goal for Ivory Coast in their 2-1 win over Nigeria, Ten Hag, who had just led United to a crucial Premier League victory at Aston Villa, was watching on TV. He admitted it was a touching moment.",
      "\"I had direct contact with Seb on Sunday night after the final,\" he said. \"There has also been frequent contact during his period of illness. I tried to support him as much as possible. Of course, he had only been away from Ajax for a fortnight when the illness was diagnosed. For me too, that was a huge blow.\"",
      "He continued: \"A sportsman in the prime of his life with a young family of three children and then such an illness. The way he dealt with it deserves great respect. He did not flee in anger but accepted it immediately and took everything he could to improve his chances of recovery and be resilient.",
      "\"He has fought his way back tremendously and then it is great that this is now followed by such a well-deserved sporting highlight.\" Haller was told he had cancer in July 2022, just weeks after joining Borussia Dortmund from Ajax.",
      "He moved to the Amsterdam club in January 2021 after an 18-month spell with West Ham following a £45million move from Eintracht Frankfurt. But the striker has never forgotten the role Ten Hag has played in his career and the pair kept in touch when the striker was undergoing extensive chemotherapy treatment to beat his disease.",
      "He returned to action with Borussia Dortmund last season - only to miss a crucial penalty in a 2-2 draw with Mainz on the final day of the season which cost his club the Bundesliga title. Ten Hag said: \"This highlight is so much to Seb's credit after everything he has been through. His story is of course super emotional. From a sporting point of view, it was difficult for him. Last year he missed the title with Borussia Dortmund and missed a penalty in the decisive match.\"",
      "\"That he then is now an African champion is great. Seb is a fantastic personality, a real team player. That attitude doesn't suit a striker, but that's how he always sets himself up. He is modest and humble, just a great player to have in your squad.\"",
      "\"And he radiates calmness and tranquillity. You can see that in his game. He is imperturbable and therefore able to score such a decisive goal at such an important moment in difficult circumstances.\"",

      "With the arrival of investment from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS Group, the question of Manchester United's home has been brought to the fore once again in recent weeks. Old Trafford is starting to creak, following a lack of investment under the Glazers' ownership, neglect that is made to look worse as their main rivals either improve their own venues or even build completely new ones.",
      "Ratcliffe's arrival - subject to regulatory approval from the Premier League - will bring a much-needed influx of cash. And an additional £237m of funding has already been specifically earmarked for Old Trafford.",
      "But the big question is, what will that money and the additional hundreds of millions required be spent on? Renovations of the grand old stadium, an extension of the existing structure, or a completely new stadium built next to the current one or elsewhere?",
      "It's an issue that provokes strong feelings - some fans have forged keen ties over the years with the existing stadium and its history and would not want to move away from that, while others feel that the club needs to move with the times in order to keep up with rivals, even if that means moving a completely new home. We asked the question to United fans via a poll here on the MEN website, and they've offered a clear preference:",
      "1,553 responses",
      "The majority of respondents to our poll - 61 per cent - said that their preference would be to knock down the existing stadium and build a new one - either on land next door or elsewhere nearby. This would, of course, be the most expensive option, potentially totalling £2bn.",
      "The next most popular move at 35pc would be to expand and fully renovate the existing stadium to stay on the same footprint. This is less expensive, but logistically difficult due to the train line running behind the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand - the obvious contender for replacement by a larger structure.",
      "The two remaining options in the survey, a small renovation of the stadium or to leave it as it is, were highly unpopular gaining just 2pc of the vote each.",
      "This is, of course, only a snapshot of opinion among the fans, with the final decision in the hands of the Glazers and the new investors. But what is clear that as Old Trafford creaks and crumbles, a solution will need to come soon.",

      "The extra four spots will be given to the leagues that have done best across all three European competitions this season. It's all about 'coefficient points', which UEFA uses to rank leagues based on how well they do in all tournaments.",
      "But having more teams from your country doesn't always mean a higher ranking as it's based on averages. For example, Czechia's clubs may not be seen as the strongest, but they have an average of 12 points and are fifth in this season's coefficient - above France.",
      "This year, England started with eight teams in European football - four in the Champions League, three in the Europa League and one in the Europa Conference League. Now, only six Premier League teams remain, with Newcastle United and Manchester United no longer in the top competition.",
      "Interestingly, English football teams have scored more points than their Italian and German rivals (England 109, Italy 98, Germany 95.5). But, because there were fewer teams from Italy and Germany playing, their average score per team is higher than the English teams. England, Italy, and Germany all have a strong showing in the knockout round. Each country will be trying to get enough coefficient points to get an extra team in the Champions League.",
      "There's something important to remember. Some teams - but not the English ones - will play the knockout playoff round in the Europa League and the Europa Conference League this week and next. This means they can add points to their national association score, but not every club gets this chance.",

      "So, which matches should we keep an eye on?",
      "In the Champions League, English teams have got lucky with their matches: Arsenal will play Porto while Manchester City, the reigning European champions, will face Copenhagen. Meanwhile, big threats from Italy, Germany, and Spain are set to play each other, which could lower their coefficient points: Inter Milan will play Atletico Madrid; Napoli will go head-to-head with Barcelona; RB Leipzig will take on Real Madrid, and Lazio will meet Bayern Munich.",
      "French teams could also do well, with four of their six teams in the knockout playoff round. Lens, Marseille, Rennes, and Toulouse are all ready to play, while PSG and Lille have already moved on to the last 16 of their respective tournaments.",
      "As for the Premier League, it looks like a three-horse race for the top four between City, Liverpool, and Arsenal. Tottenham, currently in fourth place, will be trying to keep off challenges from Manchester United and Aston Villa.",
      "The fifth spot in the Premier League could be key for Champions League qualification. Man City, Liverpool and Villa are favourites to win their respective competitions, which could lead to an English clean sweep. If this happens, a fifth English team will likely join the Champions League - and that could be good news for Manchester United.",

Boubacar Kamara suffered what looked to be a worrying injury during the second half of the game, limping off after treatment on the pitch - and Villa's worst fears have now been realised.",

The midfielder sustained the damage during yesterday's fixture with Manchester United and has subsequently undergone a scan this morning. Kamara's condition will be reviewed ahead of a further consultation with a knee specialist.\"",
      "Kamara, a France international, has been a big part of Villa's unexpected success this season. Together with Douglas Luiz, the 24-year-old has played in 30 games this season. Without him, Villa will be short of players in midfield - and the timing is particularly cruel on Emery given the January transfer window shut less than two weeks ago. Youri Tielemans, Jacob Ramsey and Tim Oregbunam are likely to take Kamara's place in the middle of the park, while John McGinn might also be called upon.",

      "Those six group games will stay in the memory, but for all the wrong reasons. The home game against FC Copenhagen was the only one that was won and that required Andre Onana to save a penalty with the final touch of the game.",
      "It felt like much of United's European campaign centred around Onana and Rasmus Hojlund. The penalty save from the former was outweighed by the mistakes he made in the other group games, while Hojlund's flashes of potential were pointless given the flurry of goals going in at the opposite end.",
      "But with European football back on the agenda, it feels like Onana and Hojlund are now delivering at the right time for United. The £47million goalkeeper is starting to come up with some big saves and the Danish striker has added goals in the Premier League to his haul in the Champions League. Unfortunately, they've aligned too late to rescue this continental campaign.",
      "When Galatasaray and FC Copenhagen followed Bayern Munich into Group A in the draw, it felt like United had a fairly routine passage into the knockout stage. That they managed to make a mess of it sums up their efforts in Europe in recent years. Damningly, they have won just one of their last nine Champions League fixtures.",
      "At a time when the future of Old Trafford is up for debate, it is the iconic nights under the lights that are flooding the memory bank for some supporters keen to make sure that history isn’t bulldozed. The reality is those famous European nights are retreating into the distance.",
      "Since 2013 United have played just six knockout ties in the Champions League, beating only Olympiakos in 2014 and Paris St-Germain in 2019, in a Parisian night that is beginning to feel like a fever dream given what has happened since.",
      "Of the 12 individual fixtures in the knockout rounds, only two have been won. That rescue act against Olympiakos in the David Moyes season and that 3-1 win in Paris. There have been three draws and seven defeats. Bayern Munich, Sevilla, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid have knocked United out of the Champions League without enduring too much stress.",
      "In the summer it felt like Erik ten Hag was making progress at Old Trafford and after that Champions League draw another attempt at finally leaving a mark on the knockout stages seemed more than plausible. That they somehow conspired to not even salvage a chance at the Europa League was disastrous.",
      "Maybe now it will reveal its benefits. This week Erik ten Hag has a free midweek to prepare his side for an awkward trip to Luton Town on Sunday. The following week the focus will entirely be on Fulham at home.",
      "The schedule is hardly relentless from here on in. As things stand, United have just two midweek fixtures to fulfil, at Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup fifth round and at Chelsea in the Premier League at the start of April. That will change if they continue to progress in the FA Cup.",
      "Fourteen Premier League matches remain for United and every one is a cup final, according to Ten Hag. Sunday’s gutsy win at Villa Park has put them right back in the conversation for Champions League qualification.",
      "This week the players will hear that iconic anthem and watch those famous games from the comfort of their own homes. It should serve as inspiration to make sure they are back in the competition next season and they can put those unwanted free midweeks to good use.",

      "All the moments you might have missed following Man United's 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Scott McTominay stepped off the bench to score a late winner and help Manchester United extend their winning run to four matches with a 2-1 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park on Sunday afternoon.",
      "After Douglas Luiz had earlier cancelled out Rasmus Hojlund's opener, the contest in the Midlands looked as though it was going to end all square, putting a huge dent in United's top four ambitions. However, McTominay connected with Diogo Dalot's excellent cross to snatch an unlikely victory.",
      "Despite having been in front for the best part of an hour, United's goal had lived a charmed life, surviving a collection of Villa attacks. Luiz's 67th minute leveller was nothing more than what the home side had deserved.",
      "However, just as he did at Molineux just under a fortnight ago, McTominay stepped off the bench to make his mark. United, as a result, have now won three Premier League games in a row and have cut the gap on Villa in the standings to five points.",
      "Below, MEN Sport has highlighted some of the moments you may not have spotted from Sunday's encounter at Villa Park.",
      "There is no stopping him right now, is there? After making it four goals in four Premier League appearances against West Ham United seven days earlier, Hojlund made it five in five at Villa Park.",
      "United had started the brighter in the Midlands and were making almost all of the early running, meaning it was no surprise when Hojlund put them ahead with just 17 minutes played. The Dane was in the right place at the right time to turn the ball home from close-range after connecting with Harry Maguire's header from a corner.",
      "It was an excellent leap by the United centre-back, and Hojlund made sure of acknowledging his efforts after being mobbed by his teammates. The striker, who was among a crowd of bodies, turned and pointed in Maguire's direction, with the defender yet to catch-up with the recipient of his header to celebrate the goal.",
      "It was clear Hojlund was grateful for the leap and knock-down of Maguire, who was proving difficult for Villa to deal with at set-pieces.",
      "As the end of the first half neared, Villa continued to ramp up the pressure in pursuit of an equaliser. Despite falling behind, they looked the better side following the goal, offering plenty for the United defence and Andre Onana to think about.",
      "Following a John McGinn free-kick that attempted to catch Onana out at his near post, Villa won a corner that McGinn, again, was elected to take. His dangerous cross from the right went towards the back post, but Maguire was on hand to nod it behind for a corner with claret and blue shirts lurking.",
      "It was a brave header and Maguire felt the full impact of it, bending over and holding his head. Nevertheless, his teammates were appreciative of his contribution, with Raphael Varane, Dalot and Onana all slapping him on the back to encourage him and thank him.",
      "With just under four months to go until the start of the European Championship, England manager Gareth Southgate will be aiming to soak up as much football as possible in preparation for finalising his squad for the tournament in Germany. Following a sharp rise in recent months, many have suggested Kobbie Mainoo could force his way into his plans.",
      "Starting for the 10th Premier League game running at Villa Park, Mainoo was given the opportunity to leave his calling card with Southgate in attendance.",
      "No doubt in attendance to watch every player who may creep into his thoughts ahead of the summer, Mainoo is an outside candidate. The United academy graduate oozed class at certain junctures at Villa Park, just as he so often does, meaning he will have no doubt left Southgate purring at certain junctures, certainly in the first half.",
      "Mainoo, who is also eligible to play for Ghana, is yet to win a senior cap at international level, meaning it will be interesting to see if Southgate selects him for next month's international break. England face both Brazil and Belgium in friendly encounters.",
      "Following Luiz's equaliser, it felt as though there would only be one winner. However, McTominay, not for the first time this season, stepped off the bench to take centre stage.",
      "With four minutes of normal time left on the clock, the Scot connected with Dalot's pinpoint cross and planted a fantastic header past Emiliano Martinez. The midfielder, who now has eight goals this term, raced over to the away end and was embraced by a cluster of United fans who had raced to the front to be part of the celebrations.",
      "On route to his destination, the Scot initially had Hojlund following his every move, with the youngster wrapping his arm around his shoulder. However, the Dane temporarily lost contact with his teammate after slowing down to 'shush' the Villa fans behind the goal that McTominay had just planted his header into.",
      "He put his finger to his lips and gestured to the home crowd, telling them to be quiet. Hojlund, who handed his shirt to a young supporter following full-time, then caught up with McTominay and his teammates and joined in with the celebrations.",

      "Plans to renovate Old Trafford under Sim Jim Ratcliffe have split opinion among supporters but former players have agreed one on point",
      "Manchester United's long-standing problem with the current state of Old Trafford has split opinion for years, with the Glazers repeatedly slammed for the lack of investment in the infrastructure of the 114-year stadium.",
      "Probable upgrades or a new build have been discussed ever since Sir Jim Ratcliffe completed his 25 per cent takeover at the club. The billionaire is said to be considering a revamp of the stadium, with a possible demolition of the current stadium replaced by a state-of-the-art arena erected in its place.",
      "The club have been advised a new build would be the best option. The Manchester Evening News understands the renovation of the home of United would be complicated due to the railway lines and the existing structures.",
      "Much has been made of the possible changes to the stadium, with a section of supporters loving the 'old fashion' feel and others wanting upgrades more swiftly to ensure they are not left behind by their rivals.",
      "A report from the Daily Mail this week have suggested United have three options to decide from - including a controversial plan to bulldoze the 112-year old arena and start again from scratch. Other options are to instead rebuild United's South Stand, extending it up and over the railway line that runs behind or for the club to instead embark on revamping the spectator and corporate facilities throughout the stadium.",
      "But players from years gone by have also waded in on the debate. Here, we take a look at what a number of players have said on Old Trafford and what Ratcliffe should do.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer",
      "Former manager and player at Old Trafford, Solskjaer became the most recent ex-star to provide his suggestion. The Norwegian has admitted that a re-build may be the best option, although did admit that the history of Old Trafford is important.",
      "\"We have to move with the times and at the moment something has to happen,\" he said, via Reuters. \"It's either renovation or a new stadium because we're falling behind if we're staying in the same place we have.",
      "\"It's going to divide fans for sure, because history is important. But we traded The Cliff (training ground), which was iconic for United and the Busby Babes, with Carrington.",
      "\"It looks like we might have to build a new stadium.\"",
      "Gary Neville",
      "Neville has been one of the most vocal in the Old Trafford debate, especially when the Glazers have been laid blame. After the 3-0 defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the ex-right-back slammed the club for turning the stadium from the \"Theatre of Dreams into the Theatre of Nothing.\"",
      "Following reports of a potential rebuild, he said on his Instagram Live: \"There is a story emerging from Old Trafford that they might rebuild the entire stadium and I have just been asked what I think of it.",
      "\"I actually think that it would be the right move. I think by the time that they have spent money on Old Trafford, the existing one, then I think you would be better off building a brand new, better, super stadium.",
      "\"I do think that Manchester United should always be at the forefront of stadiums. Have the best facilities and they have fallen behind.\"",
      "Roy Keane",
      "Known for his straight-and-narrow verdict on United, Keane's recent comments on Old Trafford were based more on the fact that clubs no longer fear travelling to the stadium.",
      "Brighton, Manchester City, Crystal Palace and Bournemouth have all won against Erik ten Hag's team in the Premier League, with Newcastle (EFL Cup), Galatasaray and Bayern Munich (Champions League) also enjoying successful trips.",
      "\"They don't really play as a team and I don't know if they [players] are taking on the manager's ideas,\" he said on the Stick to Football podcast, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"They are stuck between a rock and a hard place because again, you are Manchester United, the onus is even when you're at home, flex your muscles, and more importantly put fear into opponents' mindsets.",
      "\"But teams are playing Manchester United now and there is no fear anymore. I think teams are going to Old Trafford now and enjoy it!\"",
      "Gary Pallister",
      "Pallister, who made over 410 appearances for the Reds has claimed the idea of moving into a brand new, stylish stadium would be appealing. Speaking to Mail Sport, he said: \"I hate to say it because I never thought I’d see the day when I would say, ‘Leave Old Trafford’, but the idea of putting a purpose-built, state-of-the-art stadium next door is appealing.",
      "\"As fantastic a stadium as it is - and it’s not as bad as some people have made out - to make it the Wembley of the north might be the way forward.",
      "\"It could cost £2bn to build, which is mind-blowing. But as a player and supporter, to go into a brand-new stadium like Tottenham have got, maybe that’s the step we have to take if we want to keep our place at the top table and be spoken about as one of the elite of world football.\"",

      "The main talking points as Man Utd defeated Aston Villa in the Premier League fixture on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Manchester United battled their way to a vital win against Aston Villa, keeping their chances of qualifying for the Champions League alive. While the home side were on top for much of the encounter, it was United who found a way to take the three points.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was on hand to slide home Harry Maguire's nod-back from a corner and give United an early lead, with Andre Onana keeping the Villans out with some good saves.",
      "After Luke Shaw was taken off at half-time - as a precaution according to Erik ten Hag - Villa kept up the pressure in the second half and eventually drew level through Douglas Luiz. But Diogo Dalot's superb cross was powerfully headed in by substitute Scott McTominay with just a few minutes remaining to settle the match.",
      "Here are the main talking points from the match:",
      "It was certain Manchester United would make one change for their trip to Villa Park; the only question was who would come into the side for the injured Lisandro Martinez. Raphael Varane was overlooked earlier in the campaign in favour of players better suited to playing on the left side of defence. The solution was to play Harry Maguire there instead.",
      "Varane is still a world-class defender, though it is clear he is on the decline. The best ability is availability, and Varane is still unable to play two games in a week. That won't be such a problem for the rest of the season, but it is clearly a concern with regard to his long-term future.",
      "At Villa Park, it was Maguire who shone the most in central defence with Varane looking a little off-pace as part of a defensive line that was stretched throughout the evening. United's problem is that, given the injury situation, it is still their best partnership, though it is still flawed.",
      "It can be hard to forget just how doomed Maguire's time at the club looked a year ago. Now, he is not only their most dependable central defender; he is also their best.",
      "Maguire made the difference with his excellent assist for Rasmus Hojlund's first-half goal, but he also made a huge impact at the other end of the pitch with some vital blocks and last-ditch defensive work.",
      "In front of the watchful gaze of Gareth Southgate, Maguire once again showed exactly why he is indispensable for both club and country with the type of resolute defensive work his managers both deem priceless.",
      "At a time when Martinez will spend eight weeks on the sidelines, Maguire has only grown in importance.",
      "It sums up the infuriating enigma of Marcus Rashford that he can be United's biggest threat and biggest liability at the same time. The 26-year-old looked like he was going to make something happen every time he got on the ball at Villa Park, yet he ended the game without having anything to show for it.",
      "Rashford had Matty Cash stumbling like he was leaving a Dublin nightclub whenever he ran at him down the left wing, but this was another night in which his decision-making and end product let him down.",
      "On countless occasions, he exploited the space he created himself between centre-back and full-back, and on countless occasions, he overran the ball or played it when the momentum was already gone.",
      "At his best, Rashford is still one of the Premier League's top players, but Ten Hag still has a challenge on his hands if he is to utilise him as part of the functional forward line and not as a one-man army.",
      "The fact that he was the one brought off while Alejandro Garancho stayed on highlighted the power shift that has already taken place. The fact that his replacement netted the winner didn't help his cause either.",
      "If you were to pick United's best away win under Erik ten Hag on Sunday morning, you wouldn't be left with much choice. Everton and Wolves from this season are about as good as they had gotten.",
      "United headed to Villa Park without a win in any of their 13 trips to face a top-nine side in the Premier League, only picking up points at Tottenham and Liverpool since he arrived.",
      "This was by no means a vintage performance and was less convincing than some of their wins during the campaign, but it will now be the benchmark for all the away matches that follow.",
      "A weight has been lifted off their shoulders, and now they must try and build upon it.",
      "There can be no underestimating just how important United's trip to Villa Park was to keeping their hopes of Champions League qualification alive.",
      "Tottenham grabbed a late winner at home to Brighton over the weekend to strengthen their hopes of a top-five finish, and it was imperative that United at least didn't lose any further ground yesterday either.",
      "If, by the end of the season, United can keep their Thursday nights free for the forthcoming year, then they will have done enough to claw back the gap between them and a slumping Villa side.",
      "With the gap now at just five points, you wouldn't be surprised if they managed to do it.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay scored the winning goal in the club's win over Aston Villa on Sunday to keep their hopes of Champions League qualification alive",
      "Scott McTominay has proven to be Manchester United’s saviour on numerous occasions this season.",
      "Following the summer arrivals of Mason Mount and Sofyan Amrabat, plus the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo, there were doubts over whether McTominay would be staying at the club. United rejected a £30million offer for the midfielder from West Ham after which the London outfit decided to end their interest in the Scotland international, but McTominay could have easily been lining up in claret and blue this season instead of red.",
      "Thankfully the midfielder remained at United as he has played a pivotal role in helping Erik ten Hag’s side. His late header against Aston Villa sealed a vital win at Villa Park that closed the gap to fifth place to five points. However, it was not an unusual sight as McTominay has often been United’s matchwinner this term.",
      "The Scotland international has scored seven league goals in 21 appearances and almost all of them have been crucial in United’s quest for Champions League football. This was most evident when McTominay came on in the 87th minute against Brentford in October and scored a remarkably late brace to seal the unlikeliest 2-1 victory.",
      "Fresh from his goalscoring exploits in the previous league game, McTominay opened the scoring away at Sheffield United. It proved to be a narrow win over the Blades with the 27-year-old’s goal part of the reason United left Bramall Lane with all three points.",
      "McTominay reprised his match-winning heroics in December, though not as dramatically as he did against Brentford. The United midfielder scored a brace against Chelsea to ensure an important 2-1 victory at the beginning of the hectic fixture schedule.",
      "The start of February has proven to be more of the same. He scored in United’s 4-3 win over Wolves at the start of the month and soon followed it up with the decisive goal against Villa, in between an assist in the convincing victory over West Ham United.",
      "McTominay’s tally of seven league goals not only makes him United’s top scorer in the Premier League but all his efforts have helped put points on the board. Without the midfielder’s contributions, United would be 12 points worse off. That would leave the team 12th in the table, two points behind Chelsea and above Fulham on goal difference.",
      "Meanwhile, United also lost all three games - Tottenham, Arsenal, Crystal Palace - that McTominay did not feature in at the start of the season. He may not be the first name on the teamsheet but McTominay has made an undeniable impact for United in front of goal.",

      "\"Is it the manager's job to get the best out of him, or is it mostly himself or any player's responsibility to get the best out of yourself? I think that's more it.",
      "\"He's had a fantastic career, some ups and downs. Now we hope he's going to hit that consistency because I know and we all know there's a top player there. It's difficult to be at the top all the time, but it takes sacrifice.\"",
      "Solskajer was also asked about a potential move away from Old Trafford. There is a debate ongoing about whether to develop the stadium or to build a completely new ground.",
      "\"We have to move with the times and at the moment something has to happen,\" he said. \"It's either renovation or a new stadium because we're falling behind if we're staying in the same place we have.",
      "\"It's going to divide fans for sure, because history is important. But we traded The Cliff (training ground), which was iconic for United and the Busby Babes, with Carrington. It looks like we might have to build a new stadium.\"",
      "Solskjaer visited Old Trafford for the first time since he was sacked to watch United play Wolves in May. He will always be welcome and warmly received.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe promised Manchester United supporters to take them back to the 'the very top of English, European and world football' after agreeing to buy a stake in the club",
      "The worth of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's liquid assets has been confirmed.",
      "On Christmas Eve, Manchester United announced that the 71-year-old reached an agreement with the Glazer Family to acquire a 25 per cent stake in the club, subject to Premier League ratification. In an official statement, Ratcliffe vowed to 'provide funds intended to enable future investment into Old Trafford'.",
      "The INEOS chairman also insisted that he aims to take United back to the 'the very top of English, European and world football'. In order to fulfil such ambitious plans, Ratcliffe will have to fork out millions, upon millions of great British pounds to fund a seismic rebuild – on and off the pitch.",
      "Luckily for United supporters, the British billionaire isn't short of cash – and he seems prepared to spend it too ahead of what could be a pivotal next couple of months. As filed on the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, a Manchester United plc tender offer statement was uploaded on February 12, 2024, detailing Ratcliffe's deal.",
      "An extract from a letter to shareholders reads: \"As of February 12, 2024, James A. Ratcliffe’s liquid assets (primarily consisting of cash and readily marketable securities) were in excess of $4 billion (£3.2bn).\"",
      "\"James A. Ratcliffe’s net worth is significantly in excess of those liquid assets, primarily consists of his ownership in the INEOS Group and not subject to material guarantees or contingencies that would adversely affect his net worth.\" Forbes estimates Ratcliffe's overall net worth to be $20.2n billion ($16bn).",
      "The tender offer statement later detailed the breakdown of the total shares which Ratcliffe agreed to buy. The document reads: \"The total amount of funds required for Purchaser to complete the purchase of the Sale Shares, the Closing Share Subscription and the Subsequent Share Subscription will be approximately $909 million (£719.3m), $200 million (£158.3m) and $100 million (£79.1m), respectively, for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.21 billion (£960m).",
      "\"... And, together with the amount of funds required to purchase the Class A Shares pursuant to the Offer, assuming a number of Class A Shares greater than or equal to the Offer Cap are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn as described in Section 4 — \"Withdrawal Rights\"), an aggregate amount of approximately $1.65 billion (£1.31bn).\"",
      "With over $4 billion in liquid assets and the takeover almost complete, United look well positioned to undergo a significant makeover which sees Ratcliffe stay true to his word. It remains to be seen exactly how much money the Brit will set aside – but he's certainly not short of cash.",

      "Man United are interested in the possibility of bringing Jeremie Frimpong to Old Trafford, but it could result in a huge change being required to get the best out of him.",
      "Manchester United plan to strengthen their defensive options with the addition of a new right-back and centre-back in this forthcoming summer's transfer window.",
      "As reported by the Manchester Evening News back in September, United have provisionally planned to make four statement signings ahead of next season, with two of them set to have a defensive focus. United are understood to be once again monitoring Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Edmond Tapsoba, both of whom were on their radar last year.",
      "Both of them have played starring roles in Leverkusen's unexpected pursuit of the Bundesliga title this season, meaning it is hardly surprising they are generating interest from a club of United's ilk. Frimpong, in particular, has made impressive progress this season, playing a key role in the success of Xabi Alonso's team.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster, 23, has contributed a very impressive eight goals and 10 assists in all competitions this term, the bulk of which have come in the Bundesliga. However, his attacking output does raise questions about how he has been able to be so fruitful as a right-back.",
      "The answer is simple: Frimpong plays as a right-sided wing-back for Leverkusen, being allowed to push high on the right flank. Leverkusen play with a back-three, allowing their wing-backs to get high up the field and into advanced areas of the pitch.",
      "In the opposite wing-back berth, Spaniard Alejandro Grimaldo has scored 11 goals and registered 10 assists. Leverkusen pack their midfield and central areas, allowing Frimpong and Grimaldo to bomb forward and get into attacking areas, meaning they are essentially right and left midfielders respectively.",
      "Should Frimpong make the switch to Old Trafford in the summer, the Dutchman is unlikely to be as expressive and as threatening in a 4-3-3 formation, where he would be expected to carry out the duty of a more orthodox right-back. Diogo Dalot and Aaron Wan-Bissaka have shared the role between them over the past 12 months, meaning United do need to source a permanent figurehead for that area of the team, though the former has been impressive in recent weeks.",
      "In a 4-3-3 system, Frimpong is likely to be tested a lot more defensively than he has been in a 3-4-3 system at Leverkusen. United manager Erik ten Hag also likes his full-backs to tuck inside in an inverted role and help pack the midfield, something which Frimpong does not do at Leverkusen, with his pace and energy used to exploit spaces out wide.",
      "With that said, Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman's doubts about Frimpong's defensive capabilities could heed as a warning to United. The former Everton chief, speaking in March last year, suggested he had left him out of his squad because of his limitations defensively.",
      "Koeman said: \"No Frimpong? This is because of the system that we play in.",
      "\"He plays almost as a right-winger. My right-back should be able to defend well in the first place and I have my doubts about that.\"",
      "With that said, Ten Hag, if he adds Frimpong to his squad this summer, may be forced to consider a change in shape to get the best out of his fellow countryman. That, however, is unlikely, with almost all of United's football under him having been played in a 4-3-3.",
      "As impressive as Frimpong has been for Leverkusen this season, United cannot undo all of their hard work and understanding of Ten Hag's preferred system to accommodate just one player. United's current situation at right-back features one player who is arguably the best one-vs-one defender in the world in Wan-Bissaka, and Dalot, who is much more accomplished going forward.",
      "If Frimpong can offer a balance between the two, he would be a perfect fit. However, warnings about his defensive capabilities, such is the formation United play, cannot be ignored.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund scored for the fifth Premier League game in a row in Man Utd's 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "After silencing Aston Villa with a match-winning strike at Old Trafford on Boxing Day, Rasmus Hojlund silenced the same opponent's supporters at Villa Park 47 days later.",
      "Though he did not score Manchester United's winner on Sunday afternoon, the Dane revelled in 'shushing' the Villa fans in the North Stand as Scott McTominay celebrated his winner. Putting his finger over his lips, Hojlund knew exactly what he was doing.",
      "The striker, who had plundered his first Premier League goal against Villa in the reverse fixture in M16, was as every bit delighted as McTominay was. Perhaps more so.",
      "After all, it was his 17th-minute opener that had been wiped out by Douglas Luiz and looked set to halt United's three-game winning run. Just as he did against Tottenham Hotspur, Wolves and West Ham United, Hojlund scored before half-time.",
      "After crafting his best goal in United colours thus far against West Ham, his deadlock-breaking finish at Villa Park was not quite as glamorous. Connecting with Harry Maguire's header, the former Atalanta man was in the right place at the right time to turn the ball home and claim his 11th of the season in all competitions.",
      "Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, the 21-year-old's record for United has gone from looking underwhelming to incredibly respectful. Five goals in as many league appearances, plus one in the FA Cup against Newport County, has been him more than double his tally for the campaign in seven weeks.",
      "On current form, it feels as though there is no way of stopping him. Confidence is flowing through his veins and that is being reflected in his all-round performances.",
      "Ever since he scored his first-ever Premier League goal against Villa on Boxing Day, he has been a different player. Though his goals have been the headline moments of his recent outings, his all-round game has been much-improved, with his awareness, positioning, movement off the ball and general link-up play much sharper.",
      "United took a huge gamble when selecting Hojlund to become the new face of their forward line, particularly for such a lavish fee, but it is now becoming clear why it was one they were prepared to take. It was always going to take time for him to adapt to the demands of English football and develop a firm understanding of his teammates and Erik ten Hag's demands.",
      "But even when he could not buy a goal, Ten Hag stuck with the striker, whose love and desire to give everything for United shone through again at Villa Park. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and United's fans are quickly falling in love.",
      "His current run of form, which has seen him score five goals in six matches in all competitions, with only Wigan Athletic successfully keeping him off the scoresheet in 2024 thus far, has come as a welcome surprise to most. Nobody could have possibly foreseen his United career going from zero to 100mph in the way it has.",
      "Ten Hag might have, though. After Hojlund had ended his wait for a first league goal at the 16th attempt, the Dutchman backed the youngster to go on a run, inspired by an injection of confidence.",
      "\"I have had several talks with him,\" said Ten Hag, speaking after the Boxing Day triumph over Villa. \"I pointed out that you scored for Denmark a lot, you scored in the Champions League, you have demonstrated the ability, so you can do it.",
      "\"Believe in it and it will come. I am sure now the first goal is in, he will get more.\"",
      "Ten Hag also admitted Hojlund's confidence as a striker would increase once the goals started flowing, adding: \"Of course, when strikers don't score that is always a problem but he has a strong character and is always so determined.",
      "\"He has a big personality and that is what a striker needs. And when you keep investing, the goals will come.\"",
      "Ten Hag was not wrong, was he? Hojlund's character and mindset has been striking throughout his United career thus far. He speaks well and you can sense his hunger and determination to make a success of himself at Old Trafford.",
      "His current run in front of goal is guaranteed to come to an end at some point, presenting another challenge to get back among the goals as fast as possible. Nevertheless, Hojlund has demonstrated he has the character and resilience to overcome the most frustrating and difficult of periods.",
      "He has silenced Villa's fans twice and you would argue he will be silencing more sets of supporters between now and May.",

      "A desperate campaign that had them flirting with the bottom half of the table a few weeks ago now finally has some momentum behind it. Six games unbeaten and four successive wins are season-high marks for both metrics.",
      "The three straight league wins secured by Erik ten Hag’s side have been against challengers at the time, in Wolves, West Ham and Aston Villa. It has forced them into the top six with breathing space to those below. Now sights are set on fifth and fourth, with the gap down to five points to the former and six to the latter.",
      "A return to the Champions League feels like it is within United’s grasp once again. That is vital not only for the prestige it brings but for the revenue it delivers as well. Ten Hag admitted last week that a failure to qualify would affect his transfer budget this summer.",
      "The peak in form this season can be put down to some key players returning, although the loss of Lisandro Martinez is a major blow in that regard. It can also be put down to some changes in the fortunes of players. Victory at Villa was partly built on the saves of Andre Onana and the goals of Rasmus Hojlund and neither player was excelling in their primary function back in the autumn.",
      "But United are still living on their wits. There is a sense that their biggest weapon over the last few weeks has been their character, a refusal to cave and a willingness to fight that was perhaps also missing before the New Year.",
      "It helps to have experienced players back. Casemiro is key in that regard, as is Raphael Varane. Harry Maguire’s leadership is to the fore once again after rediscovering his best form. At Villa Park, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes were a spiky and combative midfield pair, arguing with the opposition and referee Robert Jones.",
      "But there is more to it than that. Hojlund has shown the right attitude all season but that is only growing now he is in the goals. Witness his reaction to being subbed in injury time and the way he sought to waste time and wind people up. He relishes the battle across 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo is the baby of this team, but the 18-year-old is holding his own in terms of technique and temperament in midfield.",
      "Character in a team can show itself in various ways, but a good indicator is usually whether they can ride the inevitable setbacks and body blows. United couldn’t before Christmas but can now.",
      "At Wolves they turned a commanding performance and comfortable lead into a 3-3 draw, only for Mainoo to rescue them with a moment of inspiration. On Sunday, they had surrendered all control of the game and looked vulnerable once Douglas Luiz had equalised. But somehow they roused themselves and Scott McTominay was the super sub once again, just as he had been at Molineux.",
      "Those victories are the best away wins of Ten Hag’s reign but they also feel like games United would have lost even two months ago. They are suddenly finding ways to win them and that can be transformative.",
      "But it still feels like more will be required over the final 14 games. Character can only get you so far. In their last four league games, United allowed Tottenham and Wolves to have 16 shots, West Ham had 22 at Old Trafford and Villa 23 on Sunday.",
      "In simple terms, that is too many. United have kept the opposition to under 1.0 expected goals (xG) only once in their last 12 games. That is a remarkably poor record for a team chasing the Champions League and Onana can’t bail them out every week.",
      "If the attack is beginning to click, United still need to tighten up in midfield and at the back. Opposition teams are finding it too easy to create chances against them.",
      "There is hope, however, and that had all but vanished during the five defeats in December. The personality and mentality of the team has got them back in the fight.",

      "Luke Shaw provided another defensive injury concern for Erik ten Hag after the Manchester United defender was forced off during their 2-1 win over Aston Villa",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag moved to alleviate fears over Luke Shaw's substitution during the break in their 2-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "The 28-year-old managed 45 minutes at Villa Park after starting in the previous four following his return from a muscle issue. Already this season, the England international has sustained thigh and muscular injuries that have hampered his involvement in the first team.",
      "Shaw made his return against Newport County in the FA Cup fourth-round win at the end of January after a spell on the sidelines that saw him miss the festive period. Ten Hag said: \"(It) Was precaution, Luke Shaw, he gave some messages about complaints.",
      "\"With Luke Shaw, we know his history with too many injuries and we couldn't go into that risk. A very important game but we can't miss him for six weeks.\"",
      "The full-back will be assessed at United's Carrington training ground this week, however, Ten Hag provided an early suggestion that he could be available against Luton Town.",
      "For many supporters, an immediate return to the training pitch would be a welcome sight due to the ongoing injury issues at Old Trafford. Lisandro Martinez became the latest high-profile casualty after he was ruled out for up to eight weeks with a knee injury, joining defenders Tyrell Malacia and Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the sidelines.",
      "On Sunday, Victor Lindelof was Shaw's replacement in a like-for-like switch while Raphael Varane and Harry Maguire continued as the central defensive pairing with Diogo Dalot at right-back.",
      "Should the extent of Shaw's injury be worse than first feared, Ten Hag has some big calls to make with Lindelof among the remaining senior options at the back. Nineteen-year-old Willy Kambwala is another selection possibility for United, albeit a youthful choice, having made two Premier League appearances this season.",
      "For the reverse fixture at Kenilworth Road, where United edged past Luton Town thanks to Lindelof's strike, Sergio Reguilon deputised in place for the injured Shaw. However, the Spaniards' loan was cut-short in January as United exercised the break-clause in the Tottenham Hotspur defender's loan.",
      "The former Real Madrid academy product was a short-term option until January for Ten Hag, joining as cover with Tyrell Malacia initially due to return in mid-January after two rounds of knee surgery. With the Dutchman exceeding the initial timeframe for his return Lindelof at full-back, in the absence of Shaw, could be a possibility.",
      "Wan-Bissaka's diagnosis remains unclear, while the severity of his issue remains unknown. Ten Hag said: \"I don't know in this moment what the diagnosis is. Hopefully not too bad.\"",
      "The 26-year-old has performed well at full-back for United and his injury problems come at the wrong time as he enjoyed a strong run of matches at full-back. His versatility could be an avenue to be explored but the former Crystal Palace defender has only played left-back twice during his career in the North West.",
      "He started at left-back in the 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford last month and prior to that result, two years had passed since he previously played there. He was in the left full-back position for United's 4-0 drubbing at Anfield in April 2022.",
      "On the other hand, should Wan Bissaka be fit to play against the Hatters this weekend, it could spark a change of position for Diogo Dalot, who has also played in the left-back position. As well as this, the Portuguese's sample size from the position is also larger than his defensive partner.",
      "Throughout his career, he has played 35 times at left-back - 17 of which as a United player. He was been Ten Hag's go-to left-back alternative in the absence of Shaw and Malacia. To avoid thrusting Wan Bissaka into an unfamiliar position with a lack of rhythm could be to big of a risk for United and moving Dalot across the backline to left-back could be a viable option.",
      "If Shaw was to be sidelined for the upcoming matches, a return for Malacia would be a timely boost. At the beginning of December, Ten Hag provided a positive update in the news surrounding the former Feyenoord defender.",
      "He said: \"From the New Year onwards, he can be available. What's also very good is Luke Shaw has made his return.",
      "\"We are very happy with that. Also, the others, they are working very hard to return as soon as possible.\"",
      "Malacia has been absent since the final game of last season, where he featured against Fulham. The 24-year-old missed the preparations for this season and has since undergone two rounds of surgery on the knee problem.",
      "It would be a tall, and harsh, ask to throw a player who hasn't played a competitive minute of football since May. However with the possibility of a spell on the sidelines for Shaw, bedding Malacia back into the first-team fold could be an option, even if it isn't for the entirety.",

      "The latest transfer rumours from Old Trafford amid speculation over Amadou Onana and Frenkie de Jong",
      "Manchester United have been handed a boost in their proposed bid to sign Amadou Onana - according to reports - as they continue to scour the market for a possible Casemiro replacement. United snapped-up the Brazilian coming up two years ago from Spanish giants Real Madrid for £60million plus add-ons.",
      "It came after the club failed in their chase for Frenkie de Jong as he opted to stay put at Barcelona instead. United have brought in five central midfielders - including Christian Eriksen on a free transfer and two loans - since Erik ten Hag left Ajax to touch down in the Premier League as their manager two summers ago.",
      "Reports from The Sun pinpoint continued interest from United in Onana, meanwhile, as they plot further additions in that area. Arsenal and Chelsea are also thought to be keen, but fellow suitors Barcelona might be unable to offer Everton what they want for him owing to financial concerns.",
      "United would have to pay £52million to get their man. Onana, 22, could be available next summer.",
      "Elsewhere, reports from Football Transfers reckon De Jong does not want to depart Barcelona next summer, amid one or two suggestions the Dutchman could finally leave. Barcelona have been tipped to cash-in on the playmaker amid long-standing interest from United, who failed to secure his signature last summer.",
      "The 26-year-old was nurtured by Ten Hag at Ajax and was a key player in their famous run to the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2019. De Jong, though, is said to want to stay put at the Camp Nou after joining them in 2019.",
      "United spent £180million-plus on Andre Onana, Mason Mount and Rasmus Hojlund combined this summer. It was a quiet January transfer window for the club, though, with a strong emphasis on sanctioning loan exits.",

      "Here's how the national media reacted to Manchester United's late win against Aston Villa on Sunday evening",
      "Manchester United kept their Champions League qualification hopes alive on Sunday after beating rivals Aston Villa in a crunch clash at Villa Park.",
      "Substitute Scott McTominay headed an 86th-minute winner after Douglas Luiz had cancelled out Rasmus Hojlund's opener, as Erik ten Hag's men left with all three points and in doing so inflicted a third straight home defeat on the on the Villans. The result closed the gap between United and fifth-placed Villa to five points, with Tottenham - who currently occupy the final Champions League qualification spot - a point further ahead.",
      "Here's a round-up of how the national media responded to United's third consecutive victory in the Premier League.",
      "'Optics' with Manchester United in Champions League chase",
      "Simon Stone of BBC Sport wrote: \"In points terms, United may only be three closer to the coveted top four following their win at Aston Villa on Sunday than they were after losing at Nottingham Forest on 30 December. But the optics are with them.",
      "\"Three Premier League victories in a row, including late winners at Wolves and now Villa Park after Scott McTominay settled a game United could easily have lost. Four successive triumphs in all competitions for the first time this season and winnable matches against Luton and Fulham to come.",
      "\"This latest win leaves them just six points off fourth-placed Spurs and a point nearer Aston Villa in fifth, which could even be enough to seal Champions League football next season with the two most successful countries in Europe securing an extra spot in next year's revamped competition.\"",
      "United better at the 'dirty stuff' than Villa",
      "Writing for the Mail, Ian Ladyman said: \"A thumping game deserved a thumping finale and that's what it got. A cross from Manchester United full-back Diogo Dalot found Scott McTominay bullying Aston Villa's Matty Cash on the six-yard line and the header to win the game was so emphatic, so perfectly and brutishly timed, that McTominay may well have woken on Monday morning to find the ball manufacturer's name written right across his forehead.",
      "\"What a goal to win a terrific game of football. Villa will be devastated. Between United taking the lead in the 17th minute and regaining it for good in the 86th, their opponents were the better team. Too quick, too eager, too clever and too well-drilled for Erik ten Hag's United.",
      "\"But when it came to it, United were better at the dirty stuff and the clinical stuff. Their goalkeeper Andre Onana made saves with just about every bit of his body. And when he couldn't save his team then his defenders did, throwing bodies in the way, sticking out feet and knees and thighs.",
      "\"In front of Onana, Harry Maguire - the renaissance man of English football - was sensational. What an example the United central defender sets to his team-mates these days. He no longer carries the captain's armband for Ten Hag but what's a piece of cotton anyway? Maguire - when fit to start - is the spiritual leader of this United team and here he led from the back.",
      "\"So that's four wins on the bounce now for United and the last time they did that was last May. For those looking for signs of life from Ten Hag's team, there it is. The desire to win. The ability to stay in a game that is threatening to get away from you. The scoring of late goals. They are very good habits to have, all of them.\"",
      "Andre Onana has the last laugh after Man United mockery",
      "Penning his opinion in the Mirror, Andy Dunn wrote: \"When Scott McTominay met Diogo Dalot’s cross with the meatiest of winning headers, Andre Onana resisted the temptation to dance. A short while before what is becoming a typically decisive intervention from McTominay, a smiling Douglas Luiz teased Onana with some sort of shoulder shimmy after finally turning a torrent of Aston Villa pressure into an equaliser.",
      "\"But as the supporters in the Holte End who had barracked him throughout a compelling second half found out at the final whistle, it was Onana who had the last laugh. There was no shortage of significant contributions to this highly unlikely Manchester United triumph.",
      "\"For all its customary eccentricity, there should be no denying the importance of Onana’s performance. After all, he has had enough stick this season. He is an entertaining watch, that is for sure - blending acrobatics with some unconvincing methods of clearing his lines - but there are distinct signs he is settling into one of football’s most scrutinised roles. Ten Hag’s unwavering faith in him might yet be proven to be well-placed.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag has the golden touch",
      "Filing for The Guardian from Villa Park, Ben Fisher wrote: \"On evenings such as these Erik ten Hag must feel he has the golden touch. It was not without a by now customary spot of bother but Manchester United racked up a fourth successive win for the first time this season, the substitute Scott McTominay’s powerful late header helping them to cut the gap to the top four to six points.",
      "\"Presumably the main question on the lips of fans and the thing whirring around Ten Hag’s head is: why did it take so long to get into this groove? McTominay gave Rasmus Højlund, who opened the scoring, a ­piggyback as United’s players celebrated before the away fans. Højlund exhi­bited his predatory instincts to score his sixth goal in his past seven ­appearances. But Douglas Luiz cancelled out that strike midway through the second half, at which point Aston Villa undoubtedly had United on the ropes.",
      "\"It was not quite the late, late show United required at Wolves 10 days before, McTominay scoring with 86 minutes on the clock, but it no doubt tasted just as sweet for Ten Hag. Was this the night when United lasered in on their rivals? It certainly felt a significant result, United finally winning away at another team vying for a Champions League berth. It seemed they sensed the importance of victory, too.\"",
      "Much maligned stars stand tall",
      "Richard Jolly wrote for the Independent: \"If the return of the Champions League on Tuesday offers Manchester United an unwelcome reminder of what they have lost, their exile from the European elite may be briefer than was feared. Cast ignominiously out of continental competition two months ago, their domestic form suggested they would not be making an immediate form. But perhaps they might.",
      "\"Not for the first time, Ten Hag had Scott McTominay to thank. The midfielder has emerged as the unlikely successor to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the super-sub who scores crucial goals. After a double against Brentford and a goal to put United ahead at Wolves came a header, planted past Emi Martinez from Diogo Dalot’s cross.",
      "\"Perhaps it was a day for the much-maligned to assume the roles as heroes. McTominay could have left in the summer, when he was wanted by West Ham. Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund joined, but the goalkeeper made a string of errors and the striker had to wait 14 appearances and 1,026 minutes of Premier League football to open his account in the top flight.",
      "\"But, after the increasingly prolific Hojlund opened the scoring, Onana had perhaps his best game in a United shirt. Villa are entitled to wonder how they only scored once – so poor against Chelsea on Wednesday, they subjected United to an onslaught, but the answer in part lay with Onana.",
      "\"He has delivered too few such shows of defiance in their goal – or Cameroon’s, given that he did not make a single save in the Africa Cup of Nations – but as Villa had 22 shots, 10 of them on target, he stood tall.\"",

He joins the club from Championship side Ipswich Town, where he has been working as the club's head of recruitment, most recently under former United coach Kieran McKenna, who is now the club's manager.",
      "The appointment has been led by United's director of academy Nick Cox and director of scouting Steve Brown and is part of a series of changes that have been made in the scouting department within the academy dating back to last year.",
      "The overhaul of scouting at academy level is something Cox and Brown have been working on for a while and pre-dates the Ineos' investment into United.",
      "Williams, 36, is returning to United having been a first-team recruitment analyst and academy scout between November 2017 and April 2022, at which point he left to take up the role at Portman Road.",
      "He has also previously held academy recruitment roles at Sheffield Wednesday and Bolton Wanderers. United see the appointment of someone well-versed in academy football but with experience as head of recruitment at a Championship club as a coup.",

      "The Man Utd academy continues to go from strength to strength under its head Nick Cox.",
      "The words 'Every winner was once a beginner' are emblazoned in block white capitals on the scarlet red wall. Now-and-then images of Scott McTominay, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho adorn the opposite wall.",
      "The black-and-white portrait of McTominay was taken mere months after his Manchester United debut when he was aged 20. Rashford is no older than 16 and a 17-year-old Garnacho is hoisting the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Tom Heaton and Paul McShane, back at Carrington in playing and coaching roles, also appear in an embrace from 2005 when United's reserves won the FA Premier Reserve League Shield at Charlton Athletic. \"I don't know what Paul McShane's doing up there,\" jokes the affable academy head Nick Cox.",
      "FROM 2022: 'Fernandes and Eriksen were both laughing' - the new mood at United's training complex",
      "The message is clear: all five academy graduates - goalkeeper, defender, midfielder, winger and forward - have represented their countries and played regularly in the Premier League. All five drive through the Carrington barriers daily.",
      "The photographs are married with monochrome shots of Manchester Town Hall and the city skyline. \"We've spent so much time trying to reconnect everybody back to Manchester,\" Cox explains, \"to our history but also to the city.\"",
      "United have held academy staff meetings at the Museum of Science and Industry and invited folk from the city to present to them. Tony Walsh, a lifelong United fan who uttered the immortal This Is The Place poem days after the Manchester Arena attack, struck a chord. \"It's the balance of a global brand but still feeling like an intimate family,\" Cox explains.",
      "Inside the new academy gym, goalkeeper Tom Wooster is lifting weights with a coach, Shola Shoretire, Ashton Missin and Malachi Sharpe are loosening up on an exercise bike, preparing to brace the lashing rain.",
      "When we eventually leave the £9million extension, four sodden and muddied lads are removing their boots after a morning training session. The doors to the new building opened in October, 20 years after the dedicated academy centre was opened by Sirs Alex Ferguson and Bobby Charlton.",
      "The latest addition is part of the one-club approach, with the women's team also housed on the premises. Before construction started, the exterior of the original academy building was graced by a timeline of graduates from the men's and women's teams, starting with Busby Babes captain Roger Byrne and ending with women's captain Katie Zelem.",
      "Cox has been the United academy head since 2019 and has overseen an exceptional period, even by the dream factory's standards. United have passed 4,000 consecutive matches with an academy member in a matchday squad, 22 have debuted for the first team, with Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo already indispensable.",
      "The pair were totemic during the FA Youth Cup triumph in 2022, an uplifting run in an unedifying season. Cox coaxed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid to United via Zoom calls and the aid of an interpreter from his spare bedroom during lockdown in 2020. He wryly recalls his sons, aged 14 and 10 at the time, arguing outside.",
      "Mainoo hails from Stockport and Brexit has forced United to look more intensely within their borders as they cannot recruit overseas talents aged under 18. That is a challenge the club have embraced and they have a precedent for blending homegrown British talent with continental clout.",
      "\"Think of the best United teams, the best United youth teams,\" Cox begins. \"It's always been a core of local boys who understand the club, understand the city, what it means to the local people and then elite incomers, the best around, who bring innovation and maybe a different slant on things.",
      "\"I remember talking to Nicky Butt. He and the lads showed Ronaldo or Eric Cantona the club and they said, 'By the way, this is what I eat and I go and train twice a day.' So the lads were like, we'll follow suit.",
      "\"And that goes back to youth teams that would've had Bobby Charlton in it, arriving not from Manchester, or George Best, David Beckham, or Paul Pogba or whether it's Alejandro Garnacho. That's a bit of an unofficial blend.",
      "\"It's become a bit harder post-Brexit but our talent pool now is very much a UK talent pool, it changes the challenge a little bit but the concept is still the same. How do you make sure you've exhausted local talent?",
      "\"This place has to provide opportunities for local players, first and foremost, we've got to give everyone the chance. But then how do we add from further afield to make sure we've got a pool of high-potential talent that has to go and support a winning first team? That's the challenge.\"",
      "United arranged flexible deadline day loans for Wooster, Sam Murray, Sam Mather and Sonny Aljofree to support local non-league clubs Macclesfield, Rochdale and Altrincham. Murray is one of the youngsters drying off downstairs while Mather and Aljofree have both been involved in first-team training sessions this month.",
      "Cox has always downplayed the presence of unknown quantities suddenly rubbing shoulders with first-teamers in club imagery and footage. \"It's always been commonplace but even more so under this manager, our boys will be in and around to support first-team training,\" he reiterates.",
      "\"There are probably two versions of support he needs. The academy provides two services: the academy has got to develop players who can play in that team and the other is to support that team to prepare to win.",
      "\"So recovery days, maybe when the manager's got a smaller group, we will add to that smaller group so they can have a proper, functional training session. So anyone who's not played, say there are eight remaining players, plus our 10 to make a training group so they can have a high-level functional session.",
      "\"But then on a normal training day there'll still be three, four or five lads over there. Some on merit, some just because it's the right positional fit. And the challenge for the boys is to really make a name for themselves. That jump to the first team.",
      "\"Everyone asks me, 'How do you decide? When do you decide?' There's never a day, there's always this movement back.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag is prompt on providing feedback. \"Darren Fletcher (technical director) is the biggest conduit, really,\" Cox stresses. \"He is unbelievable at managing that period where they have one foot in each camp and then me and my staff are providing feedback as well.",
      "\"John Murtough is involved in there. There's this ongoing regular discussion around where they are at, what help do they need, what does the next month look like.\"",
      "The academy is approaching another milestone. After Omari Forson's cameo against Wigan Athletic in last month's FA Cup third-round win, United are on 249 academy graduates to have played for the first team. Joe Hugill was an unused substitute that evening and has since joined Burton Albion on loan.",
      "Willy Kambwala was an unlikely presence in the starting XI at West Ham United two days before Christmas. Such unexpected promotions are the beauty of United's faith in youth.",
      "\"Every debut brings us great pride,\" Cox beams. \"As a youth developer, I take great pride from a number of sources about kids being successful.",
      "\"Debuts are obviously a more public-facing event that brings great satisfaction and noise and brings external interest. It’s amazing when young people debut here because when they come here that is what they set out to do.",
      "\"I enjoyed watching the debuts this year – Willy, Dan Gore, Omari – it’s great to see kids make debuts. We should definitely celebrate it and it is a landmark that they will remember forever.",
      "\"But it really is the beginning of the new journey. Only at 50 or 100 games can you start to think they might have cracked it. We have seen many kids at this club make one appearance and no more, and for them, they are focused and determined, driven. They know it’s a nice moment but they want to be in the team next week. They want to be in the team.",
      "\"They want to get to where Alejandro’s at. He has been in and around the squad. But now he is about to make his 20th consecutive appearance. That is when you start to think okay, 20 games in a row, that’s something. I am now starting to establish myself.",
      "\"249 is a really nice statistic because it encapsulates the great work of a number of amazing people over 90-odd years. That first debut was 1931, so all of those debuts leading us to this point, I think the beauty of that is that it’s not fabricated, it’s not forced, it’s just organic, and only recently have we just established that it’s 249.",
      "\"This club gives young people opportunities and puts players in the team. 249 is lovely. 250. Who will it be? That is the beauty of my job. We have a number of high-potential players. Knowing which one it might be next is harder but I am looking forward to seeing now how Kobbie has developed.\"",

      "Amass signed for United from Watford last summer and he's considered one of the most exciting talents in English football. The left-back has made 14 appearances in academy matches this season and he's become a key player in an U18 United side that has won every game in the league.",
      "The youngster trained with the first team on Wednesday afternoon in preparation for Aston Villa and he was joined by Sam Mather (19) and Toby Collyer (20). It's unusual for a 16-year-old to train with the senior group but Amass was selected to make up the numbers.",
      "It's understood Under-21 manager Travis Binnion advises the first-team coaching staff on which youngsters should make the step up when extra numbers are required in training.",
      "Erik ten Hag's assistant coach Mitchell van der Gaag has developed a healthy relationship with Binnion over the last 18 months and he is often the link between the first team and academy.",
      "Amass' performances for the U18s this season have not gone unnoticed and the opportunity to gain senior training experience is the reward for those displays.",

      "Man Utd youngster Kobbie Mainoo is making exceptional progress and he's already been likened to Paul Pogba.",
      "Making comparisons between established and young players is often not helpful but it's inevitable. Kobbie Mainoo has been likened to Paul Pogba and his performance for Manchester United's Under-21s against Salford City in October intensified the comparisons.",
      "Mainoo recorded two assists and he sprayed some beautiful passes under the floodlights. His movement was reminiscent of Pogba's and the MEN's match report from that game said: \"The midfielder has outgrown academy football and his talent is needed in the first-team.\"",
      "Mainoo was carefully handled after his return from injury and he featured for the U21s in a handful of games, but it was only a matter of time before Erik ten Hag gave him opportunities.",
      "The 18-year-old has been exceptional since breaking into the first-team this season and he's now one of the first names on the team sheet, which is the ultimate compliment.",
      "Speaking last year shortly after his senior debut, someone who is close to Mainoo confidently said he would play for England and he now has an outside chance of making the Three Lions squad for this summer's European Championship after making just 12 appearances for United.",
      "His progress has been remarkable and he possesses all the attributes to become a world-class talent, just like Pogba did when emerging from the club's academy in the late 2000s.",
      "Pogba left on a free transfer to join Juventus in the summer of 2012 after failing to agree a new contract when it might have been advisable to build a team around him.",
      "The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford in 2016 but his second stint wasn't a success and supporters do not remember his time in a red shirt fondly. There is no chance of Mainoo leaving on a free transfer but there is a feeling that the team should be built around him.",
      "United have developed another special talent and he has the temperament and talent to succeed. Mainoo is understood to be quiet, likeable and kept well-grounded by his parents.",
      "There were character issues with Pogba during his time at United and such problems with Mainoo seem highly unlikely to happen. He has the talent to eclipse Pogba's legacy in Manchester and comparisons between himself and Frenkie de Jong have also been merited.",
      "Mainoo has operated as a deep-lying midfielder in the majority of his senior appearances, but those who know him best have suggested his long-term future will be as a No.8.",
      "Adding goals to his game has been privately identified as an area for improvement and his two goals in two games against Newport County and Wolves show he's progressing.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner at Molineux gets better every time you watch it. It was a moment of individual brilliance and Rasmus Hojlund described him as a 'generational talent' after the game.",
      "Erik ten Hag also gave him a glowing assessment. \"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "In a separate interview with MUTV, Ten Hag added: \"What he did was great, no doubt about that. He's a calm person and it looks like he grows from game to game, so hopefully he keeps this going.",
      "\"I will push and support him, but he has to do it. He has great abilities and in the future, he can be a great player. Today, we have seen it, but also in the last couple of games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has a strong record of developing talent and Mainoo is at the right place to take his game to another level.",

      "The Reds' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City last week saw them finish second in Group B, with their otherwise exemplary record in this season's competition meaning they were set to advance to the last eight as one of two best-placed runners-up. However, Aston Villa's decision to field January signing Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 win over Sunderland has had a knock-on effect on Marc Skinner's side, who will now not progress to the knockout stages.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "I like him. He's a young kid, he's 21 and playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "If there was one thing you could bottle up in football, you ask anyone, it's confidence.",
      "He's got confidence now and football is all about confidence. He holds the ball up well and lays it off well to the wingers.",
      "You start to get into the game a lot more and the confidence rises. Those chances keep coming and you start to take them.",
      "In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it.",
      "If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper.",
      "He's a good player, I think he will be a superstar.",
      "Harry Maguire was named player of the match for United against Villa.",
      "It was a good performance and I'm pleased for him. He's a worker and he puts his body on the line. If I was playing, he's the type of player you'd want in your team.",
      "However, there's a thin line between centre-backs doing well and not doing well.",
      "Aston Villa created so many chances and if they take some of them we are having a different conversation.",
      "Villa could have scored four and then we are talking about a poor day for that United back four. That's how quickly things can change in football.",
      "However it was Maguire and United's day.",
      "He's a threat in both boxes and what I like is that when he is up for a corner he tries to score and have an effect on the game. A lot of defenders just go up and go through the motions. They are only up because the manager told them to go up.",
      "Man Utd are on a good run and have a good run of fixtures coming up, but they will have to keep winning games.",
      "Tottenham also have good fixtures coming up as this race for the Champions League starts to get interesting.",
      "But like with Hojlund, Man Utd are now full of confidence. Hojlund is scoring goals now, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are threats on the wing.",
      "I still think their game-management is poor. There are still moments when they are giving the ball away so cheaply and making the wrong decisions, and it did catch up with them as Villa piled on some continuous pressure.",
      "When they can learn that side of the game United will be a much better team.",
      "They are always going to score goals with Hojlund, Rashford and Garnacho. They just need to keep things tight at the back because for me, it will be very rare if they come off pitches between now and the end of the season without goals.",
      "Aston Villa played really well against Man Utd, but they still came out on the losing side. That is a little bit of worry.",
      "Villa created so many chances. If they create that many in another game they probably get all three points.",
      "Villa will be disappointed. You can take it when you don't play well and lose, it's just one of those things, but there is nothing worse than playing well and losing football matches.",
      "Their last five fixtures haven't been the easiest. Everton is a hard place to go, on their day Newcastle can beat anyone, Chelsea were going to click one day and then there's United.",
      "It's not like Villa have played four teams at the bottom. They have played decent teams and just haven't got the results.",
      "The name of the game now for Villa is to get back on the horse, win their next game and go again. They've got to get back to winning ways quickly.",
      "When you are winning week in, week out the players and the fans would have been turning up expecting to win with their 13th, 14th and so on victory on the trot at home.",
      "But all of a sudden, Newcastle did a job on them. Then Chelsea wiped the floor with them and now United have won. It did get nervy at the end of the game for Villa.",
      "They have got to get back to winning ways quickly. They are where they are in this league because of their home record and they've got to get winning again at Villa Park.",
      "Arsenal are now putting their chances away and working hard",
      "If you want to win the Premier League, you have to bounce back [from defeats] as quickly as you can and they have done that. That is what Man City do and they have worked hard and been hard to beat.",
      "And fair play to them, they are right in this title race.",
      "It is just a massive result, it has done the goal difference the world of good - if this was Man City today who had wonthat game 6-0, we would be waxing lyrical.",
      "They have literally made West Ham surrender, they turned up, started well and carried it on and kept on going. A brilliant, brilliant result by Arsenal.",
      "We've still got a little bit to go before we get to the serious business of the run-in.",
      "That all starts with eight games to go in my opinion.",

      "Arsenal had to win at West Ham just to stay where they are. It takes its toll.",
      "We saw it a few years ago now with Spurs when they were chasing Leicester. They kept playing second. Talk to Tiger Woods about matchplay. He wants to put his ball on the green first to build the pressure on his opponent.",
      "It makes a huge difference.",
      "Defending-wise from West Ham, if that happened in Under-10s football you'd be going, 'seriously?!'",
      "Not getting tight to the Arsenal players, showing them inside on to their proper foot, it is poor.",
      "I just think Arsenal made West Ham surrender and that is quite sad as a player as that is the one thing you do not want to do.",
      "There is ways of losing football matches, that is a horrible way and I feel sorry for David Moyes as that is not a Moyes team out there, they have let him down today.",
      "They work hard and the one thing you do not get done at West Ham is by set-plays, and they were poor with them against Arsenal."

      "It has been the age-old storyline this season - Chelsea failing to take their chances, lacking goals to win games and that instinctive No 9 that can tuck them away.",
      "But it looks like we may be seeing goals from elsewhere to help the cause, particularly from midfield.",
      "Conor Gallagher was Chelsea's star man at Selhurst Park, as has so often been the case at the ground where he was so influential on loan in the 2021/22 season.",
      "He has now scored more Premier League goals against the Eagles (4) than he has against any other side, while he's also netted more goals at Selhurst Park (6) than he has at any other venue in the competition.",
      "But his two goals represented his first in the league this season, with his superbly taken first coming with his 29th shot of the campaign - only Tottenham's Pedro Porro has now had more shots without scoring (37).",
      "Enzo Fernandez too added the third - our tipster Jones Knows backed him to have two or more shots, which he did. One of those was a fine breakaway goal with almost the last kick of the game.",
      "Both also scored in a fine win against Aston Villa in midweek too, showing there are signs of life from Chelsea's midfield.",
      "The Blues are by no means back to their best - they only had one shot in the first half, which was off target from Gallagher - but if they can start drawing goals from other areas, it would only serve them well as they look to finish the season strongly.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Crystal Palace fans would have forgiven for perhaps dreading a Monday Night Football clash without three of their best players - Eberechi Eze, Michael Olise and Marc Guehi.",
      "Although Chelsea are far from the prospect of old, they still pose numerous dangers - as Crystal Palace would heartbreakingly come to realise - but what the Eagles did do was show there is life even without their talismen.",
      "The first half especially would have been everything the fans and staff would have wanted from the team. They wanted the ball more than Chelsea, they fought harder, created more and took their chances.",
      "It saw them leave to a standing ovation at half-time, but could not quite replicate the same form in the second half. This may have been more to do with Chelsea improvement and tactical tweaks, but lapses in their own concentration also hurt them in the end.",
      "But for however long their trio are out for, Crystal Palace have shown they can compete. They will need all the heart they can muster - a lot of it on show on Monday Night Football - to keep themselves from the tail of a relegation battle.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Having struggled to convert their dominance into goals for much of the season, Arsenal now can't stop scoring. Their six-goal thrashing of West Ham on Sunday made it 16 in their last four games.",
      "Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Liverpool were swatted aside. But this, their fourth consecutive win, was their most devastating display yet; their biggest away victory in Premier League history and another statement about their credentials.",
      "This is a serious team. Already the best in the league defensively, they have now found a level of cutting edge to match. The game at the London Stadium was just the latest reminder of their potency from set-pieces. But they were rampant from open play too.",
      "There is no out-and-out No 9 capable of rivalling Erling Haaland's scoring exploits, of course. But Arsenal are sharing the goals out. Against West Ham, there were five different scorers. They threatened from all angles. West Ham could not cope.",
      "Bukayo Saka's double puts him on five goals from his last five Premier League games and he is not the only attacking player to have hit a rich vein of form at what feels like the right time. Leandro Trossard has three in his last four. Gabriel Martinelli too.",
      "The fluidity of their front line was too much for West Ham, with Martin Odegaard orchestrating proceedings and Kai Havertz constantly finding space to exploit. The fact they still have Gabriel Jesus to return from injury is another source of encouragement.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United are salvaging what at times has been a calamitous season. Three unlikely lads are helping on that front.",
      "Harry Maguire, Scott McTominay and Diogo Dalot. All three stepped up to the plate at Villa Park in what could just be a victory that completely changes the trajectory of where United are going this season.",
      "Maguire was given player-of-the-match by Gary Neville - a performance full of grit and aerial dominance in both boxes.",
      "McTominay was the match-winner with a barnstorming header - his seventh goal of the Premier League season, no player has scored more for United.",
      "And, Dalot was exemplary with the ball, including his cross for the McTominay winner. He looks every inch a Manchester United right-back now, even for the longer-term.",
      "All three players have been linked with a move away from the club in the past 18 months but the lure of being a Manchester United player has been too big for them to give up when push came to shove. You can tell they really care playing for the club - and you can't have too many of those in your squad when trying to build a successful football team.",
      "They have their imperfections but you can't knock their contributions.Lewis Jones",
      "Aston Villa had clawed it back to 1-1 against Manchester United and were pushing for a winner. Looking dangerous and more likely to get the crucial third goal, Unai Emery took Leon Bailey off.",
      "\"It was tactical,\" he told Sky Sports after the game. The fact he had to answer questions on it says a lot.",
      "Bailey was running the show down the Villa right. He set up the equaliser, no Villa player had more successful one-on-ones than him, half-time Man Utd substitute Victor Lindelof was having a torrid time. Gary Neville was calling for Diogo Dalot to swap with Lindelof to stop the tide.",
      "Bringing Bailey off let Man Utd off the hook. Erik ten Hag responded by making a positive substitution himself with matchwinner Scott McTominay. The Man Utd manager won the battle of the dugouts.Sam Blitz",
      "Freak results are a part of football, an unavoidable reality. There is, however, a way in which a team can lose on such days. West Ham's capitulation against Arsenal on Sunday certainly wasn't that.",
      "Watching Arsenal score four goals in 15 first-half minutes was shocking enough but what made it more jaw-dropping was the inevitability of it all. There was an almost immediate surrender, which Bukayo Saka, scorer of two goals, said Arsenal could sense.",
      "\"We smelt blood today and went for the kill,\" the 22-year-old told Sky Sports.",
      "David Moyes admitted this was one of the darkest days in his 26 years as a manager, but rightly reminded us that it wasn't so long ago that they were enjoying some of the best days in the club's recent history.",
      "The issue he faces is the disconnect he has with the fans who crave a more attacking brand of football. Results like this, despite Moyes' safety-first approach, don't help the manager's cause. The discontent among the naysayers will only grow after this historic defeat.Zinny Boswell",

      "\"They can claw it back,\" said Neville about United's Champions League ambitions. \"They've been appalling in the first half of the season. They've lost so many matches it's untrue.",
      "\"If they keep their players fit, which is a big question mark because it looks like they've lost another two with [Lisandro] Martinez and [Luke] Shaw in the past week, they have got a chance. Because of course they are better when they have their strength in their team. All teams are when they have their players back.",
      "\"The front three look more settled with [Marcus] Rashford, [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Rasmus] Hojlund with Bruno Fernandes in behind.",
      "\"They're better than they were but they're still not great.",
      "\"They concede so many chances, they don't really have any patterns, they don't control games or keep possession better than the other teams. But they do have players who can win matches. They are an odd bunch, I've said that for a few years, they play in moments during matches.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Keane says Tottenham and Villa will be \"getting worried\" about United picking up results, but adds that Ten Hag's forwards are getting their defenders \"out of jail\".",
      "\"United still gave up loads of chances, the problems are still there for them,\" Keane said. \"They got away with it today, because the attacking players are scoring goals.",
      "\"But there's no surprise the amount of chances they give up, they do it every week. They've got away with it in three or four weeks. Their attacking players are getting them out of jail.",
      "\"The key for me is the attacking players are scoring goals. And what they've got, which Villa don't is that momentum.",
      "\"If you're in the Spurs and Villa dressing room and you see Man Utd coming up behind you, you're going to be worried. History will play a part, they've got the goals.\"",
      "Amongst the goals is United striker Hojlund, who has scored once in each of his last five Premier League games since Boxing Day.",
      "Fellow Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson says the Danish forward, who failed to score a Premier League goal before Christmas in his debut season, is going to be a \"superstar\" after overcoming his early United struggles.",
      "\"I like him. He's a young kid, 21 playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. If there was one thing you could bottle up in football, you ask anyone, it's confidence,\" he said.",
      "\"In those first 10 games, when he was going without a goal, he was snatching at everything. And he's got it.",
      "\"If that ball [for Hojlund's opening goal] at Villa comes in at the start of the season, he would've hit it as hard as he could. But he places it under the goalkeeper.",
      "\"He's a good player, I think he will be a superstar.\"",
      "Asked about Hojlund's improvement, Keane said: \"He's on fire, it took him a few months to get up to speed. He's part of a settled team now and he's got confidence.",
      "\"I believe every time he walks on the pitch, he thinks 'I'm going to score a goal for Man Utd'. It's a good return, considering the first few months he had. He's showing good form.",
      "\"You look at the lack of strikers at Man Utd. So the manager has been forced to play him week in and week out.",
      "\"The fact he's had to do that, and Ten Hag has had the option to take him out and give him a rest, is a big help.\"",
      "If Manchester United are to make up more ground on the Champions League-chasing teams, they will look at the next few matches with fondness, says Neville.",
      "Ten Hag's side go to Luton next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Their next league away game after that is a daunting trip to title-chasing Manchester City, but around those games are home matches to bottom half clubs Fulham, Everton and Sheffield United.",
      "\"That's a great run of fixtures. If you forget the Man City game, those six games… they don't deserve anything if they don't pick up anything against those teams.",
      "\"I wouldn't be confident going to Luton next week, but them and Fulham [are winnable]. Every team gets beaten at the Etihad Stadium but then you have Everton and Sheffield United at home.",
      "\"In terms of the league games they've got, the four around the City game, you wouldn't say they're not favourable.\""

      "Scott McTominay's late winner earned Manchester United a first away league victory against a top-nine side under Erik ten Hag, as Aston Villa were beaten 2-1 to blow the race for Champions League football wide open.",
      "In-form United started fast at Villa Park and took a deserved lead through Rasmus Hojlund's fifth goal in five Premier League games.",
      "Villa dominated the big chances but found Andre Onana in inspired form, with the United goalkeeper making four big saves, including two from Ollie Watkins.",
      "The pressure eventually told as Douglas Luiz fired home from Leon Bailey's cross with over 20 minutes to go - but United had the last laugh.",
      "Substitute McTominay headed Diogo Dalot's first-time cross in from close range with four minutes of normal time to play to earn United a precious three points, which moves them within five points of fifth-placed Villa.",
      "\"It's a massive win for us,\" said Ten hag to Sky Sports after the game. \"We get closer and that's the aim for today, that was absolutely our target and we did it. The way we did it, I liked it.",
      "\"I never think negative scenarios. I think positive. We know we have to catch up and we are not there yet. We are in a good mood and keep this process going.",
      "\"There is much room for improvement, if we do this and there are more games to play, let's see where it goes.\"",
      "Villa controlled the first-half possession but United looked dangerous on the break early on. Bruno Fernandes fed Hojlund in the penalty area only for the striker to sky his close-range effort, while Alejandro Garnacho blasted a long-range effort wide.",
      "Then came the opening goal as Fernandes' corner found Harry Maguire - who had escaped Boubacar Kamara's clutches - at the far post, leaving the onside Hojlund the simple task of tapping home.",
      "Villa's response to the early setback was excellent. John McGinn forced an acrobatic tip over from United goalkeeper Onana, who was also equal to Watkins' one-on-one inside the box as the hosts opened up Ten Hag's side in a sweeping move.",
      "Jacob Ramsey, who had a bright game in midfield, then put an effort from inside the box wide as Villa ended the opening period strongly.",
      "Man Utd took the influential Luke Shaw off at half-time due to injury and it took just three minutes for replacement Victor Lindelof to make a big error.",
      "The Swede gifted the ball to Matty Cash deep in the United half and he squared to Watkins who looked certain to score - but once again hit Onana.",
      "Ramsey had two more chances, failing to trap Bailey's incisive pass for a one-on-one, before seeing a low shot blocked by Dalot on the line.",
      "Eventually, the pressure told. Onana made another point-blank save from Clement Lenglet from a corner but, after United cleared, Bailey put the ball back in the mixer for Luiz to fire high into the net.",
      "United tried to respond straight away as Garnacho fired wide of the near post after a mazy run - but Villa stepped back on the throttle.",
      "Luiz had a big chance following Dalot's poor clearance but the midfielder failed to make a big connection. Substitute Moussa Diaby then curled over as Villa looked dangerous on the counter-attack.",
      "Back came United as Garnacho fired straight at Emiliano Martinez after another solo run. But United's late winner came from a familiar source.",
      "Dalot's instinctive cross was headed home by McTominay from close-range, which could be a massive goal in the context of the top-four race.",
      "Aston Villa: Martinez (6); Cash (7), Carlos (6), Lenglet (6), Moreno (7); Luiz (7), Kamara (5); McGinn (6), Ramsey (7); Bailey (7), Watkins (5)\n\n\nSubs used: Diaby (7), Tielemans (6), Zaniolo (n/a), Digne (n/a)\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (8); Dalot (7), Maguire (8), Varane (7), Shaw (6); Casemiro (6), Mainoo (6), Fernandes (7); Garnacho (7), Hojlund (7), Rashford (7)\n\n\nSubs used: Lindelof (5), McTominay (7), Amrabat (n/a), Evans (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Harry Maguire (Man Utd)",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag to Sky Sports:",
      "\"I liked especially the first 20 minutes, after that we were dropping too much. We had our moments in the counter attacks, but at 1-1 we had to fight back.",
      "\"It was really high intense, and you could see how many players were fatigued by the end. It was so open and it could have gone two ways. They had the mentality to win this day, especially the substitutes.",
      "\"Scott, he's great. He can score many goals, he's always coming in positions to score goals. We had some problems, it was too much like a tennis match. Every game we went for goal instead of waiting for the right decisions. With McTominay, he can get in the box and could score goals.",
      "\"Our defensive organistaion in the first part was very good, on the ball we were calm. Once we were winning, we changed our mindset. You can do this when the game is going to an end to play out the result. In the first 20 minutes we scored, why not keep going?\"",
      "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery to Sky Sports:",
      "\"We did a good plan. We controlled the game, we avoided the transitions. We didn't concede a lot of chances to them and we got control of the game, not only controlling possession, we were even having chances. And we didn't score some clear chances.",
      "\"I am very proud of our work and our players. We are being more consistent in the league matches. But it is a tough evening for us and tough to accept. But that's football, we have to score more.",
      "\"We had the chances and sometimes we are being clinical, sometimes we have days like today. Against Manchester United you can lose, because they're clinical, but this is the way.",
      "\"I'm very proud of our work today, the players are proud. At the end we didn't win because we weren't clinical.\"",

      "Sunday 11 February 2024 07:56, UK",
      "It is an image which will be referenced and reused in years to come.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration at the Argentine's first goal in the win over West Ham, immediately struck as an iconic moment.",
      "But whether it will be looked back on as the dawning of a new era of success for United or a brief flash of promise which faded away will be down to that talented trio, the group around them and the work of head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "Promise is one thing but at United results are demanded right now.",
      "That was the message emphasised by Ten Hag as he sat down with Sky Sports at United's training ground, still warming up after a session out in the sleet and wind at Carrington. They were tough conditions, he says, but these are the decisive days - and even in February, United are in must-win mode.",
      "Back-to-back victories last week against Wolves and West Ham have boosted the mood - \"It gives confidence,\" says the Dutchman - but if the team are to achieve Champions League qualification, the eight-point gap to fourth-placed Aston Villa must be closed when United go to play Unai Emery's men on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.",
      "\"We have some exciting players,\" smiles Ten Hag when asked about Hojlund (aged 21), Garnacho (19) and Mainoo (18) sat together.",
      "\"We also have had such [standout] moments during the season - for instance, the brilliant goal from Garnacho against Everton,\" he says, referencing that spectacular overhead kick at Goodison Park.",
      "\"We have some very high potentials in this squad. And now we have to perform to high levels.",
      "\"We do it now in some games but on Sunday, for instance, we get an opposition who have a very high level. So that's a challenge to perform there and to get end product from those players on Sunday. So they are the next steps, which have to come.\"",
      "Ten Hag knows all about the power and momentum in-form young players can bring to a team. It was a driving force during his time at Ajax. It has also long been a foundation for success at United.",
      "Coupled with the experience of players such as Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, it can be a winning formula.",
      "\"They bring energy,\" says Ten Hag of his young players. \"I think it's always a combination of experience and high potentials. And when they respect each other, and they want to strengthen each other, then you have a team and that is always the objective because every player knows when there is a team you can achieve higher performances and higher levels and so achieve more.\"",
      "Another key ingredient, of course, is goals. And in Hojlund, United now have a striker who looks to have finally found his feet in the Premier League. There were a flurry of strikes in Europe earlier in this campaign but with four goals in his last four top-flight games, it feels like the big-money summer signing is now starting to deliver.",
      "That scoring streak began against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, when he hit a late winner in a comeback victory at Old Trafford. The relief and release of pressure when that ball found the net was plain to see in his celebration. But it is perhaps the consistency of selection in attack which has maintained his run of form.",
      "In each of United's last four Premier League games, they've had Marcus Rashford and Garnacho flanking the young Dane. The front three have a combined 10 goals and three assists in those matches - more than the 10 goal involvements they've registered between them in other Premier League games this season.",
      "\"Football is about co-operation,\" says Ten Hag. \"Finding the spaces by movements, by moving the ball and bringing players into positions where they can attack opponents or get into one-on-one situations. And then those players have the abilities to score goals.\"",
      "Finding familiar patterns and combinations across the pitch has been an issue for United and Ten Hag throughout this campaign because of a long list of injuries. Ten Hag celebrated the fact he could finally name his strongest XI for the first time this term against Wolves last week. A game later, he lost Lisandro Martinez to a knee injury.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" he says when asked if that has been the great frustration of this season. \"It stops the progress.",
      "\"Every time you have to adjust you don't have routines, you don't have partnerships and that is what we have seen.",
      "\"I think we have had nine different set-ups in the centre-half positions. In other positions we have to swap a lot and that was forced by injuries so we hope now we can keep a consistent team.\"",
      "United will certainly have to be at their best this weekend. Ten Hag describes the work of his counterpart at Aston Villa, Unai Emery, as \"incredible\", and the hosts will be eager to respond to their surprise FA Cup replay loss to Chelsea on Wednesday night. But this is the time when United need their stars - and rising stars - to step up.",
      "\"We know we can beat them,\" says Ten Hag, referring to the Boxing Day win. \"But Sunday is a new game. It's a test. We have to take the chance.\"",

      "Thursday 8 February 2024 06:12, UK",
      "Are Manchester United getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators.",
      "The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "Billionaire Ratcliffe, who founded the INEOS group, is acquiring a 25 per cent stake of United for a fee of £1.2bn, which moved a step closer after a successful vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday.",
      "\"I was told that Sir Jim Ratcliffe turned up for one of his meetings and he had the feeling that for arguably the biggest football club in the world, the wow factor just wasn't there. I agree with that,\" said United We Stand Editor Andy Mitten to Sky Sports News.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage.",
      "According to the Telegraph, Ratcliffe is against the idea of relocating the club but feels supporters will be behind a stadium move if they stay within the same land.",
      "United own around 100 acres of land around Old Trafford, 43 acres of that land is ripe for development. Around 25 acres are said to be unused.",
      "As part of the Future of Football series, Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Hadid Architects, said the manner in which Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool have renovated their own stadia, rather than building new ones, is the template United should follow.",
      "\"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums,\" he said.",
      "\"I know why Everton are moving but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.\"",
      "Gary Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"Maybe what Liverpool have done is the way forward,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"If there is a shortage of funds, maybe get one or two stands, absolutely world-class, and the other two follow up over the next five to 10 years. That would be a plan.\"",
      "Could Manchester United get a new stadium? Sky Sports' Future of Football series took a closer look at stadiums and how they could develop in the future...",
      "Oh, quite a lot. \"Old Trafford is falling down\" is the first line of a chant that fans of rival clubs have continually used to point fun at United this season.",
      "The falling standards of United's ground have been well-documented. Videos of run-down parts of the ground have circulated online in recent years and even though it is the largest club stadium in England, it was not selected to be one of the host venues for Euro 2028 in the UK and Ireland.",
      "\"The main stand does need doing, so does the roof, but the exterior of the stadium needs doing too,\" added Mitten.",
      "\"It looks a little bit red in different areas and there are fundamental issues with Old Trafford which are not great. The legroom is notorious in the stadium.",
      "\"The designs of stadiums have changed since then when they first designed stadiums and the legroom is still the same now.",
      "\"It's a beautiful stadium, Old Trafford - but I'm not a fan of the roof because I think it comes in too low.",
      "\"Old Trafford shouldn't be getting smaller, it should be getting bigger.\"",
      "Neville has been very vocal about the need to improve the Old Trafford facilities. \"I've heard that there is only a couple of hundred million of pounds or so being spent on Old Trafford. That's nowhere near enough,\" he said late last year.",
      "\"I'd rather have £200m spent on the old stadium and have two parts of Old Trafford looking absolutely amazing.",
      "\"It's important that you have pride in where you play and Old Trafford is an amazing stadium.\"",
      "The last time the club undertook major works on Old Trafford was in May 2006, when 8,000 seats were added to the north-west and north-east quadrants of the stadium.",
      "That work was approved before the Glazer family took control of the club in June 2005, meaning no work has been done to renovate Old Trafford since United's majority shareholders took over 19 years ago.",
      "Mitten believes the Manchester United fans are divided on how they want Old Trafford to be redeveloped, but adds that money and costs will come into the equation.",
      "\"From what I can see Manchester United fans are split on the decision of re-developing or building a new stadium,\" he said.",
      "\"I've been lucky enough to see some stadium developments around Europe such as Marseille. I've always favoured a re-development but I'm open to hearing and so are other fans. If the re-development ends up costing more money than a new stadium then that sheds the debate into a different area.",
      "\"Some fans love the idea of a new stadium. I love what Real Madrid have done and what Barcelona are doing, but I'm not completely against the idea of building a new stadium.",
      "\"I just favour a re-development. For me, Old Trafford just needs to be expanded. Old Trafford is a brilliant stadium but it's not the best stadium in the world.\"",
      "Staying on the same land is a move Tottenham made when they developed their new stadium. Spurs left their old White Hart Lane ground in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, before moving back into their new 61,000-seater venue in early 2019.",
      "One issue is that Old Trafford is located between a railway line and a canal, making the logistics relatively challenging. While Brentford managed to overcome a similar challenge for their Gtech Community Stadium in 2020, their stadium is much smaller, holding just 17,000 fans.",
      "The renovation of the Aviva Stadium in Dublin's Lansdowne Road also saw railway-line-related challenges, with a line running alongside the west of the stadium. That renovation was completed in 2010.",
      "The Daily Telegraph reports that expanding Old Trafford would cost United around £800m, whereas a new ground would cost around £1.5bn to £2bn.",
      "Tottenham's new stadium cost the club around £1.2bn, according to Spurs owner Daniel Levy in an interview in November 2020.",
      "As part of his £1.2bn deal to buy a stake in United, Ratcliffe is putting £239m into the club to help boost the club's infrastructure. Qatari banker Sheikh Jassim, who rivalled Ratcliffe in the running to control United, was willing to pledge £1.27bn for the same work.",
      "United could lobby The Government to fund part of this stadium project as part of the 'levelling up' pledge, according to the Telegraph. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said last week: \"Whatever it is they [Ratcliffe and INEOS] want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future.\"",
      "But if those requests are not granted, then the only way United can afford this stadium is if either Ratcliffe ups his £239m pledge, the Glazers suddenly invest in infrastructure for the first time, or the club borrows more money.",
      "And United already have around £969m of debt, according to data from March 2023. So where will the money come from?",

      "Goals at Luton, Darwin Nunez offsides, Morgan Gibbs-White to score and Enzo Fernandez shots are on Jones Knows' betting radar this weekend.",
      "Being wrong is part of this job. It comes with the territory. It was one of those very wrong weekends.",
      "Newcastle vs Luton to have 11 or more corners - there were 10 corners.",
      "Crystal Palace to avoid defeat at Brighton - they lost 4-1 having been 3-0 down at the break.",
      "And, finally, 50 or more booking points in Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. There was one booking in a non-event of a thrashing.",
      "Total wipe-out.",
      "It made me ponder how wrong would you rather be?",
      "When it comes to betting, your stake goes down the drain whether you are slightly wrong or very wrong.",
      "The overall result was just one point lost, the same as last weekend where we were just a Curtis Jones shot away from landing an 8/1 winner after landing two legs of the treble in what was some, gets my trumpet out, superb value seeking punting.",
      "BTTS & over 2.5 goals in Luton vs Sheffield Utd, Darwin Nunez to be caught offside 1+ times vs Burnley & Enzo Fernandez 2+ total shots vs Palace",
      "In theory it shouldn't matter how wrong you are but oh boy it does - purely for confidence reasons.",
      "I've never really understood why managers don't like rolling the dice in a game when 3-0 or 4-0 down. Surely risking a thrashing to try and get back into the game makes sense as it doesn't matter if you lose 10-2 or 4-0, it's only three points lost.",
      "But the psychological aspect is key isn't it.",
      "Even someone like me who has been punting, rather successfully, for a long time has been questioning my decision making when eyeing up some angles this week. It's like when a batsmen who is on a run of ducks thinks the ball fizzing his way is the size of a ping pong ball or when a striker runs through on goal and can only see the goalkeeper.",
      "The mind, eh? Such a powerful beast. We must stick to the process. Power through that variance.",
      "There are three bets to attack this weekend.",
      "Luton side are playing with a bravery and intensity that is taking the Premier League by storm and catching oppositions cold. Everyone seems to know their roles in their unique man-for-man pressing setup and their attackers are playing with great confidence in front of goal.",
      "Over their last five Premier League games there have been 24 goals scored, almost five goals per game while Sheffield United are averaging 4.57 goals in their matches across their last seven games. Draws really are no good for Sheffield United in their predicament, so I'm fully expecting a goal-heavy encounter.",
      "No Premier League player is averaging more offsides per 90 this season (1.27) than Darwin Nunez as his eagerness to break offside traps has seen him flagged offside 22 times in his last 15 starts. That included being caught by Burnley's trap twice in the reverse fixture in December. Vincent Kompany's team do like to play a high line - only five teams have caught more players offside more than this season than the Clarets (47).",
      "All this adds up to Nunez's offside probabilities looking very strong at the 10/11 with Sky Bet offered for one or more.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's raw average of 1.99 shots per 90 in the Premier League is enough on its own to make the 10/11 with Sky Bet on him having two or more shots an appealing wager but when you throw in the likely one-sided game-state vs Crystal Palace along with his increased confidence levels you've got yourself a blinding spot of value to attack.",
      "As hinted above, there is a clear trend developing that these types of games down at the bottom are producing more attacking intent than what the expected models are spitting out for the bookmaker lines. Of the 25 games involving both Sheffield United, Luton, Burnley, Nottingham Forest, Crystal Palace, Everton and Brentford this season, the overall goal average has been 3.04 per game - above what has been expected by the market. And 40 per cent of those 25 games have seen four or more goals scored. The goal lines are worth attacking with the 9/2 on offer for five or more goals a sensible play considering all the evidence.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White ran amok playing in his preferred free role in the reverse fixture between Nottingham Forest and Newcastle, racking up an expected goals tally of 0.33 from his three shots at goal.",
      "I'm adamant we're dealing with a Champions League level player in time and his goalscorer prices remain hard to ignore with 13/2 anytime available with Sky Bet. He has scored twice since Nuno Espirito Santo took the reins and we have the added bonus of him being the likely penalty taker, which are being awarded at a rate of 0.29 per game this season meaning that 13/2 is a slice of value just on those grounds.",

      "The Radar column looks at the curious reluctance to praise Mikel Arteta's work at Arsenal and how Rasmus Hojlund has taken matters into his own hands to solve his scoring issues at Manchester United; plus: Tino Livramento's push for a Newcastle starting spot",
      "Sunday 11 February 2024 15:19, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta takes his Arsenal side to West Ham's London Stadium on Super Sunday on the back of a resounding victory over leaders Liverpool which reignited their Premier League title hopes.",
      "The underlying numbers highlighted Arsenal's superiority. Their total of 3.50 expected goals was the highest by any side against Liverpool on record. At the other end of the pitch, Jurgen Klopp's team were limited to only 0.37 expected goals, their lowest total of the season.",
      "It was an outstanding display, even factoring in the defensive lapse which allowed Liverpool back into the game on the stroke of half-time. But all that was rather lost in the fallout.",
      "Instead, the focus centred on the manner in which they enjoyed it. Arteta is not the first manager to celebrate a crucial goal by sprinting out of his technical area. Jurgen Klopp can testify to that. But rarely has the act provoked quite so much censure. At least not since the last time he did it.",
      "The obsession with Arteta's touchline behaviour fails to acknowledge the role of his emotional investment in improving the atmosphere at the Emirates Stadium. His intensity feeds into that of the crowd. Home advantage has been enhanced.",
      "Sunday's game was just the latest example. A once indifferent arena now crackles with anticipation for the biggest games. Connections have been forged. The mood has been transformed.",
      "If Arteta's perceived ill-discipline is somehow setting a bad example, it is not rubbing off on his players. They have received the fewest bookings in the Premier League this season having gone through the entirety of last term without a red card.",
      "More important than all that, though, is that Arteta has created a team capable of producing results like the one they celebrated on Sunday with increasing regularity.",
      "Arsenal have played six games against big-six opponents in the Premier League this season and not lost once. Manchester City, like Liverpool, left the Emirates defeated, having managed only 0.48 expected goals, a figure that remains their lowest of the season.",
      "Arteta has been healthily backed, of course. Both in terms of time and financial support. But Arsenal's re-emergence as contenders over the last 18 months owes more to him than any signing.",
      "The role of his coaching can be seen in the improvement of individuals across the squad. But it is even clearer in the collective. Arsenal have become the best side in the division defensively. Key performance indicators suggest they are up there offensively too.",
      "There remains a curious reluctance to praise his work. But this is what Arteta has created. A team rivalling the elite. A manager in his first job going toe to toe with two of the best in modern history in Pep Guardiola and Klopp. He deserves better than the trivial focus on how he and his players choose to celebrate.",
      "The goals are finally flowing for Rasmus Hojlund. Having not found the net once in his first 14 Premier League appearances, the striker, a £72m signing from Atalanta, now has four in four.",
      "His thrilling potential is shining through. It is a cause for celebration for Manchester United. But it would be hasty to say they have figured out how to get the best out of him. More accurate is that Hojlund has found ways of doing the job himself.",
      "Consider the fact that only one of his last five goals in all competitions, his late strike in the FA Cup fourth-round win over Newport County included, has been assisted by a team-mate.",
      "And even that goal, Sunday's opener against West Ham, was largely of Hojlund's own making as he collected Casemiro's interception with his back to goal before dummying his way past two defenders and brilliantly finding the bottom corner from the edge of the box.",
      "In total in the Premier League this season, a third of Hojlund's 24 shots have been unassisted. The same can be said for more than half of his 10 goals in all competitions. Without a reliable supply line, the Dane is having to generate his own chances.",
      "Wasteful finishing has been a factor too, of course. Hojlund missed nine big chances without scoring in the first half of the season, according to Opta. But the shot numbers are revealing.",
      "His average of 1.66 attempts per 90 minutes is the fifth-lowest of the 40 strikers to have played at least 400 minutes in the Premier League this season. Hojlund sits between Lyle Foster of Burnley and Sheffield United's Cameron Archer. It speaks to United's issues that their back-up striker, Anthony Martial, is even lower.",
      "Erik ten Hag spoke of improved service and better balance in United's front line after the win over West Ham, referencing the decision to switch Alejandro Garnacho to the right flank in recent games while restoring Marcus Rashford to the left.",
      "But the numbers show no tangible change to the number of chances Hojlund is getting. In fact, his four goals in four games since Boxing Day have come from only six shots, a total bettered by 73 players in the Premier League in the same timeframe.",
      "Across the four Premier League games in which Garnacho has started on the right with Rashford on the left, the pair have only found Hojlund with five and six passes respectively. He remains on the periphery, averaging only 26 touches per 90 minutes.",
      "Could it be that the responsibility lies with Hojlund himself? It seems unlikely given the quality of his movement. He ranks among the Premier League's top 10 players for attacking runs per 90 minutes and only slightly lower for runs challenging the opponent's backline.",
      "The problem is that United's wide forwards have other priorities. Rashford and Garnacho are averaging nearly twice as many shots as Hojlund. Given how infrequently they pass to him, it is hardly surprising they have only created six chances for him all season.",
      "It is to Hojlund's credit that he has found ways around the issue.",
      "Against Tottenham, a stunning finish slammed into the roof of the net after Rashford had been tackled while dribbling into his zone. Against FC Copenhagen, a rebound slotted home after Garnacho declined to square the ball to him for a simple finish.",
      "He is adapting, learning to rely on his own quality and intuition rather than the service of others. But for how much longer can he feast on scraps? Manchester United must find ways of feeding him properly if his recent scoring feats are to continue.",
      "Dan Burn will not remember his battle with Luton's Chiedozie Ogbene fondly. In fact, it is a probably a stretch to term it as such given its one-sidedness as Rob Edwards' side claimed a 4-4 draw.",
      "At £13m, the 31-year-old has been an excellent signing for Eddie Howe's side, adjusting from centre-back to full-back admirably and playing an important role in last season's Champions League finish.",
      "But as Newcastle continue to ship goals at an alarming rate - they have already conceded more this season than in the whole of last term - the case for Valentino Livramento to step in grows stronger.",
      "Left-back is not the 21-year-old's favoured position, of course. He is naturally right sided. But his substitute appearance against Luton, when he helped Newcastle recover to salvage a draw, was just the latest example of his capacity to play there.",
      "His drive gave Newcastle a new dimension in attack. At the other end, while Burn was dribbled past four times in 63 minutes, Livramento wasn't beaten once. He has in fact only been dribbled past nine times in 19 Premier League and Champions League appearances all season.",
      "His versatility is not lost on Howe, who has used him on both sides since his £40m arrival from Southampton in the summer. After Saturday's game, he described him as an \"outstanding player\" who will have a \"huge bearing\" on the club's future.",
      "But maybe the future is now. Against Nottingham Forest, live on Sky Sports on Saturday, Livramento will be ready and waiting to step in.",

      "Wednesday 7 February 2024 13:40, UK",
      "It is not even 20 years ago that Emirates Stadium and Wembley Stadium were best in class for stadium design in the UK and around the world.",
      "While both are still considered excellent venues for hosting top-class football and events, there is no hiding the advancements in stadium design in such a short space of time, with the opening of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in 2019, and other new stadiums around the world.",
      "But are brand new stadiums the future?",
      "The Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday evening that Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to create a new stadium for Manchester United, who have spent the last 114 years at Old Trafford, which holds nearly 74,000 spectators. The plan, according to the report, would see United create a 'Wembley of the North' to rival the 90,000-seater national stadium in north London.",
      "As of Wednesday morning, Sky Sports News understands all options are still on the table with regards to Old Trafford and no decisions have been made at this stage. Could those plans include the renovation of Old Trafford?",
      "Last summer, as part of Sky Sports' Future of Football series, with the help of the architects designing and the clubs building the stadiums, we took a look at some of the key developments in stadium design and what could be around the corner in stadiums of the future.",
      "Are Man Utd getting a new stadium? What will it mean for the future of Old Trafford? And how much will this all cost? Sky Sports takes a look at the key questions...",
      "Renovation and refurbishment is certain to play a huge part in stadium design in the future.",
      "We are already seeing that in Spain. The renovation of one of the world's most famous football stadiums is well underway as the Espai Barca project sees Barcelona upgrade the Camp Nou and renovate 18 acres of the area surrounding the stadium.",
      "Real Madrid are another club going through the same process with the Santiago Bernabeu and in England, Liverpool are continuing to make improvements to Anfield. Those projects come in comparison to Everton, who are building a brand new 52,888-seater stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock.",
      "Jim Heverin, a director at Zaha Adid Architects who has worked on projects including the London Olympics and the recent Qatar World Cup, believes the model adopted by the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and Liverpool are the future of stadium design, suggesting Manchester United's Old Trafford could be a candidate for renovation in the future in the same vein as the Camp Nou, particularly with sustainability in mind.",
      "He said: \"At Old Trafford, you'd definitely expect them to be thinking about repurposing and not going anywhere else. Look at what Liverpool has been doing with these small modifications and upgrades. That looks like the future and not brand new stadiums.",
      "\"I know why Everton moved but that is looking more like the old way of looking at new stadiums, particularly when you have something already that is an asset.",
      "\"First, you need to look long and hard at why you cannot upgrade that as the starting point,\" he added. \"There are so many positives to that and for many English clubs in the future that will be their starting point, and it should be.",
      "\"You can get everything you need by doing that and also you can save a lot of carbon by doing so.\"",
      "Another key part of the evolution of stadium design is the ability for an arena to be reconfigured and used for more than one purpose, hosting multiple sports and event types. For example, at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium it is not uncommon to see football one weekend, American football the following weekend, a music concert in midweek and later this year you'll even see a karting track at the stadium, which will be set up perfectly for each individual event.",
      "Chris Lee, who is the managing director of global design firm Populous, who were the architects and lead designers of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, will have seen this change first hand from his involvement with the Emirates Stadium project and then as project director of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Not only do these events allow a club to increase their revenue and bring a wider programme of events that can be enjoyed by spectators, but it also provides a more sustainable stadium that can be enjoyed for many years by a huge number of people.",
      "For new stadiums all over the world, being multi-functional with, for example, moving pitches and a retractable roof to help facilitate multi-use design, is a top priority.",
      "Lee said: \"From a societal perspective, having these big venues sitting in the middle of our communities where they are important but then being able to be used literally seven days a week, whether it is your local football team, rugby, NFL or concerts, I think that is really important from many perspectives.",
      "\"From an architect's and designer's perspective, being able to reconfigure space is really exciting. We now have the technology to be able to have huge bits of buildings literally moving to be able to reconfigure them, so they are all perfect.",
      "\"We tried this as architects in the 60s. We saw great visionary stadiums like the Aloha in Hawaii where stands moved or roofs moved, never particularly successfully, but now I think we are at a point where we have engineering technology where we can genuinely reconfigure buildings.",
      "\"Every stadium and every location is different,\" he added. \"But we have to work with our clubs and our partners to see how we can accommodate the multi-use piece, but accommodate it so it is perfect.",
      "\"If you looked at Tottenham, it was designed clearly as the perfect stadium for Spurs. Premier League football was at the heart of it, but it is also really the first bespoke NFL stadium built outside of the continental US.",
      "\"Sightlines work, locker rooms work, everything works, and when you go in there for a Tottenham game to an NFL exhibition game, it's a different venue. It feels different, it looks different and works perfectly for both codes.\"",
      "There was a trend, particularly in America, for stadiums to be pushed to the outskirts of towns and cities. However modern stadiums have moved back into the heart of their communities.",
      "The stadiums are now the centre piece of the local community and are a hub of activity all year round. It can also lead to a regeneration of the area as improvements are made to the local facilities and transport links in the area, benefitting the whole community.",
      "An example is Fulham's new Riverside Stand - designed by Populous - which will not only increase Craven Cottage's capacity by 3,000 seats to 28,000, but will also house restaurants, bars, a hotel, health club, and conference and event spaces.",
      "The project will also see a riverside walkway open that will help provide community amenities on matchdays and non-matchdays, and also allow the public to walk along the banks of the Thames between Hammersmith and Putney bridges for the first time.",
      "\"When we look at our cities, particularly in the UK and around Europe, our cities grew up around these buildings,\" Lee said. \"They are part of our fabric and part of our daily lives. The game on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, the circus comes into town and the stadium changes.",
      "\"I think it is important the stadiums stay in our communities. If we looked in the 70s and 80s, there was a move on an urban planning level to say these buildings are bad neighbours and we'll push them to the edges of the cities.",
      "\"In America, cities moving their stadiums to the outskirts and surrounding them by literally acres of black top car parking was the norm and then in the 90s, and actually with a baseball stadium we did in Baltimore at Camdens Yard, it was to help the clubs and the stadium are actually good neighbours and they are good regenerators.",
      "\"A key part of the future will be how we can move stadiums sensitively back into our cities, keep them there and then bring the life, the fans and the regeneration that spills out from them into our local communities.\"",
      "Heverin also believes stadium design should be and will be pushed in the future to come up with new ways to involve the communities.",
      "He said: \"We should be pushed to think of more interesting ways to involve the community.",
      "\"We have a project where we've looked at a ground concourse that could also work as a market. You can set up stalls in the concourse and really use the space as a covered market out of matchdays.",
      "\"It's a really interesting way to look at the concourse, a more public way rather than just for those who pay a certain amount of money, for example to use conference facilities.\"",
      "Heverin is currently project director for of the Eco Park Stadium project for Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Sustainability is an issue in all walks of like and a topic for everyone to think about, but in particular in architecture and construction it is a critical issue.",
      "The brief at Forest Green Rovers is to create the world's greenest stadium as the club look to raise the profile of sustainability in sport, with Eco Park marketed as \"the world's first timber stadium.\"",
      "Heverin, who believes football needs to help raise awareness of sustainability, is hopeful the project can help show what can be done in the future as the environment continues to be at the forefront of everyone's thoughts.",
      "\"The amount of carbon involved in stadium construction is a big subject,\" he said. \"Football needs to be cognizant to that as much as anyone else.",
      "\"There's a responsibility there to make sure that everything is heading towards net zero.",
      "\"The brief at Forest Green was to make the stadium net zero,\" he added. \"For the owner, the stadium needs to be an embodiment of his sustainability and low carbon principles.",
      "\"When you look at a club like Forest Green Rovers, it's interesting how good they are at chasing net zero and their carbon considerations through the whole supply chain.",
      "\"It's not just stadiums, where is the kit coming from? Where is the food coming from? What do we use as fertiliser? Where is that coming from? They question everything and are making sure it's sustainable and coming from renewable resources. They are taking responsibility for all of that and if a small club can do it, the bigger clubs need to be doing it too.",
      "\"I hope that is the value that comes out of a stadium and project like Forest Green Rovers. It shows that you need to be doing this and it is part of the future of being progressive off the pitch as much as on the pitch.\"",
      "For Barcelona, sustainability played a part in their decision to upgrade the Camp Nou, along with what the new campus can bring to the surrounding neighbourhoods around the stadium.",
      "Alex Barbany, head of business development of the Espai Barca project told Sky Sports: \"In the current times, sustainability is a given. You cannot just go ahead with a project like this without giving thought to sustainability.",
      "\"At Camp Nou, we are preserving the first two tiers and building the third from scratch. One hundred per cent of the gravel is being recycled, 50 per cent of it will be recycled into our own project and the other will be used for other projects across the city after we reached an agreement with the town hall.",
      "\"We are paying special attention to delivering solar panels on the roof so we can use renewable energy for our own consumption in the building.",
      "\"Sustainability has to be the norm all over the world. The fact we are renovating the stadium and not demolishing it and building it as brand new, that makes us feel proud.\"",
      "Barcelona, who enjoy a huge number of visitors to the club, are equally proud of the part their new facilities will play as they look to make their campus more \"relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community\" with site that will have a constant stream events all year round.",
      "Barbany said: \"There are very few stadiums around the world that sit at the heart of a global capital city like Barcelona, which has a huge touristic graphic and flow.",
      "\"There are very few of those and new projects which are being built in such sizeable and central locations of an international appeal like Barcelona.",
      "\"If you add on top of that the strength and the quality of the brand of Barca, that sort of sizeable, central location within a city like Barcelona, we believe it makes it truly unique.",
      "\"Having the luxury of the central location and the flexibility and land around the stadium is making it possible to do what we are doing. That is what is enabling us to deliver that community element and make the neighbourhood and the city truly become part of it, especially beyond matchday.",
      "\"On non-matchdays, roughly 95 per cent of the traffic on campus is from tourists and visitors. One of our main challenges is to become much more relevant in the minds of the residents and the local community so they are just not thinking about us on a matchday but to have rotating content which makes the Camp Nou and the arena relevant, in terms of entertainment options on any given day or weekend.",
      "\"You don't always have the opportunity in your lifetime to reshape the largest stadium in the world and to develop a brand new campus in the city centre of a city like Barcelona, which pretty much everyone in the world knows what it is and where it is.",
      "\"This will be the true legacy of this club for the next generations, and that is what keeps everyone so excited about the project.\"",
      "Head of Business Development of Espai Barça Project Alex Barbany:\n\n\n“It’s always the dilemma for a club like ours.\n“We have 100 millions fans all over the place and obviously it is really hard for many of them to come over to Barcelona and enjoy the live experience.\n\n\n“It’s definitely one of the main challenges for the industry.\n\n\n“The fans around the world are connecting with us through social media, and that is the channel where we get the most interaction with our fans, but at the moment we don’t have the right products to engage with them and to monetise it yet.”",
      "Barcelona are also looking to the future, revealing the Camp Nou upgrades are a \"catalyst for the digital transformation of the club\", and they are not the only club keeping an eye on the digital and technological revolution.",
      "With the global reach of the world's top clubs continuing to grow every season, increasing profile beyond the physical footprint of fans attending the stadiums will be high on the agenda as virtual and augmented reality is explored.",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, finance expert Kieran Maguire said: \"Looking forwards, there is talk about the rise of the metaverse - the ability to use augmented and virtual reality to bring a matchday experience to people's own homes.",
      "\"Manchester United claim to have 1.1bn followers around the world. So, instead of Manchester United being limited to 75,000 people being able to attend Old Trafford, why can't we have some form of match taking place at Old Trafford physically and then have it also simultaneously being broadcast in some 3D format to New York, Lagos, Melbourne and Beijing, and you've got 40 or 50,000 fans attending there.",
      "\"All of a sudden, those people are willing to pay the equivalent of 30 or 40 bucks to be in a stadium or 10 bucks to to have that matchday experience at home.\"",
      "We saw a small glimpse of what the future might hold during the Covid-19 pandemic when fans were locked out of stadiums for a period of time, forcing them to watch games at home, linking up with friends and family on Zoom.",
      "So, how does this evolve and what does it mean for stadium design?",
      "Populous managing director Lee said: \"The live remote audience is the next frontier for stadium design.",
      "\"None of us could possibly predict where digital is going in any sphere, let alone sport, so our job is really to provide an immensely robust backbone that we can accommodate any kinds of potential future digital uses.",
      "\"But I think AR, VR and hybrid realities are absolutely going to play a part in our future experience, whether it is in stadium or the remote audience.\"",
      "\"Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones famously said one per cent of Cowboys fans are going to visit the AT&T stadium, so it's how to deal with the other 99 per cent who won't ever visit that stadium but you know are watching that game at the same time in bars and restaurants all around the world.",
      "\"It's about how you connect those people and that's the exciting bit,\" he added.",
      "\"We had glimpses of this during the pandemic - the Zoom audiences and the carboard cut-outs in stadiums - but what that showed me was that the live audience is critical. Without the live audience, sport is very different and a very different live experience. But equally, you know that there are 10,000 to 100,000 people and more in little bars around the world, in Sao Paulo, in Sydney and other places, watching that game.",
      "\"The question is how we can have those audiences interacting in the same space, digitally.",
      "\"Fans, atmosphere and experience, will always play a huge part in stadium design going forward, but digital is probably going to be the biggest change we see.\"",
      "So, could we be heading to virtual stadiums with family, friends and strangers for matchday experiences in the coming years? Virtual and augmented reality is a topic we looked at in further detail in our Future of Football series.",

      "Andre Onana was required early on. Set plays are always a threat with James Ward-Prowse on the ball and his right-wing corner found the head of Tomas Soucek, the ball deflecting awkwardly off Edson Alvarez, but the goalkeeper reacted quickly to his left.",
      "In an opening 45 minutes otherwise short of thrust in the final third, Hojlund was clinical. Casemiro nipped in to win a loose ball - how Ten Hag has missed the Brazilian - and the striker proceeded to cut in on his right foot and lash the ball into the corner.",
      "West Ham had more shots and the better chances in the first half, but their big opportunity came early in the second when Emerson nicked the ball off a sluggish Harry Maguire but proceeded to fire over the bar on the angle of the six-yard box.",
      "Manchester United raced straight up the other end to punish that wastefulness. Garnacho's goal owed something to fortune, his left-footed shot was heading straight for goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski, on as a substitute, before the ball deflected in off Nayef Aguerd.",
      "It was still not straightforward for Ten Hag and his team. Maguire was caught out again when Jarrod Bowen ran in behind him but Diogo Dalot's saving tackle maintained the two-goal lead. And there was the frustrating sight of Lisandro Martinez going off injured.",
      "But Phillips, on as a substitute after costing his team a goal against Bournemouth in midweek, was then caught out again. Scott McTominay nicked the ball off him in midfield and laid the ball wide for Garnacho to finish expertly with Fabianski flat-footed.",

      "\"We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage. He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",

      "Plus: Lack of belief costs West Ham at Man Utd; Nottingham Forest show signs that they can get themselves out of Premier League relegation trouble after draw at Bournemouth",
      "Monday 5 February 2024 13:55, UK",
      "Mikel Arteta praised a string of Arsenal players in his press conference after their 3-1 win over Liverpool. Kai Havertz was \"unbelievable\" up front. Gabriel Martinelli brought a \"streetwise\" edge. But his warmest words were reserved for Jorginho.",
      "\"I always say that he is an example, a role model,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"He has had an issue he has been carrying for months. But he is always the first one in and the last one out. For all the kids at the club, if you want to look at somebody, just look at him.\"",
      "The 32-year-old was outstanding on his first Premier League start since November, bringing control, combativeness and composure to Arsenal's midfield. He passed with purpose and was alert to everything, allowing the hosts to dominate for long periods.",
      "His inclusion provided added security alongside Declan Rice, with Havertz dropping back to form a box midfield together with Martin Odegaard. But Jorginho also dictated Arsenal's offensive play, making more passes in the final third than anyone else.",
      "The quality of his distribution shone through. After half-time, there was a delightful pass to release Kai Havertz on the left. Earlier in the game, he created a great chance for Martinelli in similar fashion.",
      "The final flourishes were left to others, with Bukayo Saka, Martinelli and Leandro Trossard the scorers as Arsenal racked up three goals, and an 'expected' total (3.52) higher than any side has managed against Liverpool since Opta started collecting the data.",
      "But no player contributed more to their dominance than Jorginho. In and out of possession, he was crucial in securing a result which propels Arsenal right back into the title race.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag had prefaced the game against West Ham with a word of warning in his programme notes. \"One of our biggest issues this term has been our inability to gain rhythm, and good results have too often been followed by setbacks.\"",
      "He would have been thinking of the home win over Chelsea that was followed by a 3-0 Old Trafford defeat to Bournemouth. Or perhaps another occasion in December when United beat Aston Villa only to lose to Nottingham Forest just days later.",
      "In between those results came the unexpected draw at Liverpool that was followed up with defeat at West Ham. But this time it was different. After overcoming Wolves in the 97th minute on Thursday evening, United secured their biggest home win of the season.",
      "The 3-0 win over West Ham was not a dominant display. The opposition had too many shots for that. This five-game unbeaten run in all competitions includes victories over Wigan and Newport in the FA Cup. But caveats aside, there is cause for some optimism.",
      "Able to select what might be his strongest side, Ten Hag will be hopeful of developing the rhythm of which he speaks and the confidence that comes with it. He needs to buy time and results do that. It is Aston Villa away next. Win that and belief really will grow.Adam Bate",
      "Mauricio Pochettino knew what he was walking into when he became Chelsea manager, but that does not make it any easier.",
      "Chelsea finished 27 points off the top four in 2022/23, their worst season since the mid-1990s. They are on course to finish just seven points better off this time around.",
      "There is no question Todd Boehly's spending has been as much of a blessing as a curse for Chelsea, and it has earned Pochettino a great deal more patience than many managers be afforded after losing to Nottingham Forest, Brentford, Everton and now Wolves - twice - in the space of barely half a season.",
      "But a line has been crossed now. One four-goal humbling in a week is bad enough, and Liverpool are not a team any young, inexperienced side wants to face. But losing so heavily at home to a Wolves side who have been crippled by FFP restrictions and who were many pundits' outside shout for relegation at the start of the season - that is beyond the pale.",
      "For the first time, the fans turned not only on the team but on Pochettino himself. His name was audible around the press box when his players trudged off at half-time, and not through messages of support. There were barely enough fans left at Stamford Bridge come the full-time whistle to give him any more abuse.",
      "Chelsea are awful in both boxes. Judging by xG deficit, they have the second-most wasteful strike force in the league. They have now shipped 39 goals this season - more than the combined tally of Jose Mourinho's back-to-back league winners of 2004/05 and 2005/06.",
      "There is talent in this team. But there is no collective. Individual quality will not paper over the cracks of a lack of wider cohesion. Pochettino is far from the only one at fault for that. But he is the one who will carry the can if things do not improve quickly, because Stamford Bridge is already turning toxic. It is only going to get worse.Ron Walker",
      "The defensive mix-up between Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker for Arsenal's second goal dominated the post-match fall-out at the Emirates Stadium. But they were not alone in their travails.",
      "In fact, there are other Liverpool players who can count themselves lucky not to have come under closer scrutiny. That calamitous second goal was the turning point, of course. But Arsenal created enough chances to win the game twice over.",
      "Their entire defensive unit struggled in the face of Arsenal's speed and incisiveness. The returning Trent Alexander-Arnold could not get near Gabriel Martinelli and nor could Ibrahima Konate. Joe Gomez was similarly poor on the opposite flank.",
      "In midfield, Alexis Mac Allister was the only one to emerge with any credit. Either side of him, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones allowed the game to pass them by. Harvey Elliott struggled too following his second-half introduction as Arsenal maintained the upper hand in midfield until the end.",
      "Further forward, Liverpool got nowhere near the levels of recent performances, mustering a solitary shot on target and totalling a meagre 0.41 expected goals to Arsenal's 3.52. Diogo Jota's heavy touch when put through on goal in the first minute set the tone for a poor display.",
      "Alisson and Van Dijk were the fall guys in the end. But their errors for the second goal were symptomatic of a dismal collective performance. Liverpool must regain their focus quickly.Nick Wright",
      "This was quite an odd game. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win and at no point looked like they would lose against West Ham, yet were dominated in the shots and expected goals categories and allowed their visitors nearly 50 per cent of the possession.",
      "Despite that, Andre Onana was only forced into one notable save - and that came in the 11th minute. West Ham's best chances fell to Emerson, their left-back.",
      "The Hammers were still in the game until another Kalvin Phillips error set up Man Utd's third goal late on, yet they never made a concerted effort to put pressure on their hosts.",
      "Perhaps that's not surprising when you look at David Moyes' record at Old Trafford - he has failed to win in 17 Premier League games as the visiting manager.",
      "Remarkably, the only manager to endure a longer run without winning at a Premier League ground is also Moyes, at both Anfield and Stamford Bridge.",
      "Did he, or his team, believe they could win? The fact they played the entire game without a No 9 and chose to leave Danny Ings on the bench was curious.",
      "After a bright first half of the season, West Ham have failed to win in their first six games of 2024. Their hard work is in danger of being undone.Joe Shread",
      "There was conviction in Nuno Espirito Santo's voice when he responded to being asked whether Nottingham Forest should have taken more than a point from their trip to the south coast in a post-match interview at the Vitality. \"Yes, it could have been more,\" he said.",
      "This was not just a manager with a biased view of his own team. Forest gradually grew after going behind, with all five of their shots in Dorset hitting their intended target. Bournemouth were the Premier League's form side throughout November and December and they were left limited, particularly after the break.",
      "Had they been able to capitalise on Philip Billing's late red card for cynically catching Callum Hudson-Odoi on the Achilles, there probably wouldn't have been a huge volume of complaints.",
      "The point they earned moved them a further point clear of the relegation zone. It has given them a temporary reprieve, even though Brentford above them and Luton below them still have games in hand. Those are matters for another day, though.",
      "By no means does this team look like they are prepared to accept their precarious position. There's plenty of post-Steve Cooper confidence, new signings still to be bedded and players yet to return from AFCON to bolster the numbers.",
      "Take that and the fact Luton having stunned Brighton in midweek and held Newcastle to a 4-4 draw on Saturday, there's extra pressure on the clubs at the bottom to up their game to avoid getting left behind.Dan Long"

      "Lisandro Martinez was forced off with an apparent knee injury in the second half of Man Utd's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday; defender suffered injury after tangling with Vladimir Coufal; Martinez only returned from a long-term foot injury last month",
      "Monday 5 February 2024 18:16, UK",
      "Erik ten Hag says Lisandro Martinez potentially suffered a \"very bad\" injury in Manchester United's 3-0 win over West Ham on Sunday.",
      "Ten Hag added the injury to Martinez - who only returned from a long-term foot injury last month - is a \"personal disaster\" for the defender.",
      "Martinez suffered the issue when tangling with Vladimir Coufal as he attempted to shield the ball out for a goal-kick in the second half at Old Trafford and was replaced shortly afterwards.",
      "Asked how serious the Argentina international's issue is, Ten Hag said: \"I can't say but it doesn't look good. There is a bad concern.",
      "\"We have to wait for a few days for the diagnosis. We do everything to get the right diagnosis and see what is the damage.",
      "\"He is very sad, very disappointed. We all feel really with him. First of all, it is a personal disaster when it is really bad, but also for the team it is really bad because he definitely brings us a lot.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports, the United boss added: \"It is very bad - very bad for him, very bad for the team. He is a very important player for us.",
      "\"We have centre-backs who can fill in but he brings spirit to the team, apart from his football abilities.\"",
      "Martinez spent nearly three months on the sidelines before returning for the 2-2 draw with Tottenham on January 14.",
      "Since he was brought back into the side, United have remained unbeaten, winning three and drawing one of their four games.",
      "However, they have actually won more points and conceded fewer goals per match without Martinez in the side in the Premier League this season.",
      "United are well-stocked at centre-back should Martinez remain absent in the long term, with Ten Hag able to call on Raphael Varane, Harry Maguire, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof, who returned to the squad after injury on Sunday.",
      "West Ham boss David Moyes said Martinez made \"a huge difference\" for United, explaining: \"He brings much greater calmness on the ball in their build-up play.",
      "\"I am not an expert on Manchester United but I think that makes them look more comfortable.\"",
      "Moyes even highlighted a key moment in the game when Emerson was running through on the angle after dispossessing Harry Maguire.",
      "Martinez was able to force Emerson wide, with Moyes saying: \"I think he was a bit spooked by Martinez.\"",
