      "Oliver Glasner is among the contenders to succeed Ruben Amorim and become the new Manchester United head coach. The Austrian, 51, took over at Selhurst Park in February 2024 after Roy Hodgson ’s unhappy return to the club.",
      "He kept them up and then led them to the first major silverware in the club’s history with the FA Cup and then the Community Shield - and into the top four of the Premier League earlier this season. The South London club are now playing their first European campaign in the UEFA Conference League, Glasner is out of contract in June and has claimed Palace’s packed fixture schedule has meant there is no time for talks.",
      "But his appointment at Old Trafford would make plenty of sense for both him and Manchester United for a number of reasons...",
      "1) He is a proven winner",
      "In Germany, Glasner took Wolfsburg into the Champions League and then led Eintracht Frankfurt to the Europa League title after beating Barcelona and West Ham.",
      "He has made history at Crystal Palace by winning the FA Cup and the Community Shield after famous Wembley wins over Manchester City and Liverpool",
      "2) He plays 3-4-3 but is flexible",
      "Glasner deploys three centre-backs but gives his wing-backs licence to get forward. Their recent slump in form has coincided with the injury to Daniel Munoz.",
      "The Austrian started his managerial career at SV Reid and then as assistant at Red Bull Salzburg playing 4-4-2. He did the same at LASK but changed when they got promoted to the top flight.",
      "He explained: “My two centre backs were too often surprised with long balls and I’m very pragmatic and I thought: ‘Okay, we need somebody who protects the space behind our centre backs. We have to take the one striker out and put him in between the middle ones. Of course not like a libero in former times but to be more compact and consistent in defence.",
      "“I have played 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1, 4-3-3, 3-4-3, 3-5-2, I played everything, but the patterns were the same. So the philosophy never changed, but the system changes.”",
      "And he insists having three central defenders works at Palace now because of his squad profile. “We have no physical monsters in central midfield,” he explained.",
      "But before hosting Amorim’s side at Selhurst Park in November, Glasner said: \"It's really funny that sometimes it's talking about this 3-4-3 system and I think that Man United and ourselves have the highest xg in the Premier League for scoring goals and playing the same system. So it looks like it's a good attacking system.”",
      "3) He is out of contract this summer",
      "Manchester United are set to pay out £10m for the 18 months left on Amorim’s contract after splashing £200m in the summer transfer market. Glasner will come without compensation in the summer and without the need for an immediate overhaul in players. The Austrian also enjoys living in the UK and exploring London.",
      "4) He is smart and diplomatic",
      "Glasner has handled the impending departure of his captain Marc Guehi perfectly - and can be funny. He joked before Christmas he has been too busy to buy his wife a present and wore his lucky black Boss jumper on the way to FA Cup success. He has been unhappy about the slow business in the last two transfer markets and showed unusual candour after losing at home to the Old Trafford club and complaining about his squad depth for competing at home and abroad.",
      "He said: “It’s the first time in your history that you play European football. So let's invest instead of saving. We saved and that's what we're facing. I would have wished for a little bit more backing, yes. I think in January we just correct what we failed to do in the summer.”",
      "Crystal Palace broke their club transfer record by signing Brennan Johnson for £35m in the first few days of the January window.",
      "5) He cannot take Palace any further",
      "Glasner has achieved miracles despite the South London club selling Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze in the last two summer windows - and captain Guehi is out of contract in the summer and will leave then if not before. Adam Wharton and Jean-Philippe Mateta will also be targets of big clubs at the end of the season as Palace are unlikely to be in Europe again.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been cautioned against bringing in Roy Keane as temporary boss following Ruben Amorim's exit. The Portuguese manager was sacked on Monday morning after an explosive press conference that followed Sunday's 1-1 draw with Leeds United at Elland Road.",
      "The search for Amorim's successor has already begun, with Darren Fletcher stepping in as caretaker for Wednesday evening's Premier League encounter against Burnley at Turf Moor. There remains a chance that United could name an interim boss until the season's end, before pursuing a permanent hire during the summer.",
      "Old Trafford legend Keane has emerged as one of the candidates being mentioned by some pundits for the temporary role. However, former United keeper Ben Foster reckons Keane's lack of patience with today's modern stars would make him unsuitable for working with the existing squad, who could push his limits.",
      "Instead, he's proposed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should make a comeback to the dugout for now.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, the former Watford and Wrexham goalkeeper joked: \"I think Roy Keane would last about five minutes with these players before he punches somebody in the face. One of those players not tracking back or throwing their arms in the air and bang.",
      "\"Solskjaer's your boy. It's a proven, tried and tested method of doing things. Give him a temporary job. Give it to Ole to steady the ship, bring a bit of harmony back about the place and let the players feel good about themselves again. Don't get carried away with 'Ole's at the wheel' though.\"",
      "Solskjaer has been out of work since Besiktas dismissed him in August. Speculation has surfaced suggesting the 52-year-old would welcome the chance to return to United after previously accepting the same role in December 2018 following Jose Mourinho's departure.",
      "The Norwegian delivered a remarkable run of results that earned him the position permanently. Nevertheless, he was eventually dismissed in November 2021 after a poor start to the campaign.",
      "Foster's observations come after he suggested that United should target Aston Villa manager Unai Emery as their next long-term appointment. His comments came despite doubts over whether the Spaniard would consider the role given United's present chaos.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Foster said: \"I have to throw one name in there, who's the best manager in the worl‎d for me at the minute and that is Unai Emery. Aston Villa fans will hate this because they do not want to get rid of this guy, because he is right at the top. I don't even know if he'd be interested, though.",
      "\"I get the impression they need somebody with a big character, a lot of authority and almost a bit of an aura to take ‎that pressure away from the players. I just think there's too many chefs trying to stir the broth of Manchester‎ United.\"",
      "He added: \"There's too many people who are so unwilling to relinquish the bit of power that they have at United, whether it's chief execs or the director of football. No manager now will be able to come into United and just have full autonomy or the full say so and be able to do whatever they want to do.\"",

      "Manchester United's change in the dugout won't alter their plans regarding Kobbie Mainoo - who will remain at the club following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "It was all change on Monday morning as the Portuguese head coach was relieved of his duties following a 14 month spell. Several players had fallen out of favour under him with Mainoo perhaps the most high profile of those.",
      "His stock had massively dipped and he's yet to start a Premier League game this season, largely warming the bench. There had been interest from the likes of Napoli, whilst Mainoo has rejected the offer of a new deal, but Amorim claimed he was the \"future of the club\" recently.",
      "His dismissal doesn't move the dial and the academy graduate will remain at Old Trafford. A new manager could yet make him a regular once again, like he was under Erik ten Hag, with plenty of onlookers believing in his talents.",
      "Zirkzee saw Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha all arrived in the summer, which has left him as a squad player. He was previously a success with Bologna before moving to Manchester and - after only 18 months in England - Roma will hope to see him rediscover that goalscoring touch at the Stadio Olympico.",
      "It is set to be a quiet January transfer window for the club, especially now they have no permanent manager in the building. It was their lack of plans this month that had appeared to frustrate Amorim before his exit. He was vocal about that prior to his sacking this week.",
      "He said last week: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversations at this moment to have any change in the squad. There's a process, there's an idea that is going to continue.\"",
      "It is understood that Amorim wanted certain problem positions addressed, but the hierarchy didn't want to invest further this month. They spent big in the summer and have been looking to get away from the short-term solution spending that has hampered them in the past.",
      "The former head coach wanted a new midfielder and more wing-backs to aid his system, but his dismissal means the club will again go back to the drawing board with their next set of targets needing to compliment their new manager's approach.",

      "Most of the Manchester United dressing room are said to have been left unhappy that Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, with many of them still backing the Portuguese head coach.",
      "His 14-month reign was bought to an end less than 24 hours after the draw at Leeds, but owed to a power struggle behind the scenes. Whilst key members of the hierarchy had their issues with Amorim, the players very much still had confidence in him.",
      "United players were told of Amorim’s departure on Monday morning but The Sun claims that many of the players felt his sacking had been coming for a few days. A large number of United players expressed their gratitude to Amorim on their social media accounts in the hours following his sacking - which hasn't always been the case when managers have left Old Trafford.",
      "There had been signs of improvements under the Portuguese boss. The win at Liverpool was a landmark moment whilst they had beaten the likes of Newcastle. Equally there had been low points, drawing at home with West Ham and Wolves, but the players had continued to believe in what Amorim was offering.",
      "That said, it has emerged that there was a confrontation between Amorim and Lisandro Martinez, which led to the pair squaring up. The Argentine felt he was ready to start and thought that the Portuguese head coach was neglecting him. He would later return to the XI and wear the captain's armband.",
      "Unlike with previous managerial dismissals in Manchester, the players were not consulted about Amorim’s position before the decision was taken. The Ineos hierarchy made the decision themselves, which has put more heat on their next call in the dugout.",
      "Ultimately it is believed that his press conference at Elland Road was the final straw. He hinted at numerous frustrations, which centred around a desire for more power and influence. Amorim also claimed he was already looking to the time when he left Manchester once his contract expired.",
      "Gary Neville insists that no one has come out of the Amorim fallout looking good. He said: \"When a manager is sacked, it's a poor reflection on everybody. It means it's not worked.",
      "\"Ultimately everyone loses, particularly when you are sacking a manager partway through the season. It's very difficult to get an adequate replacement in.",
      "\"I am surprised it's happened this morning, I'm not surprised it's happened. I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. I did think they'd get through another couple of weeks and try and work out what to do.\"",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves is hoping Marcus Rashford makes his way back to Old Trafford following Ruben Amorim's exit from the club. The Red Devils' academy product is currently on loan with La Liga heavyweights Barcelona, having spent the second half of last season on loan with Aston Villa after his relationship with Amorim broke down.",
      "Rashford, who remains tied to United until the summer of 2028, bagged the opening goal of Amorim's reign back in November 2024, finding the net three times in six appearances before quickly falling from grace.",
      "The Portuguese manager axed Rashford in December that year and issued a stark ultimatum to the forward, declaring: \"Our team should be so much better with Rashford. But he has to change. If he changes, we are more than welcome to put in a talent like Rashford and we need it.\"",
      "Despite his impressive displays at Villa Park, there was no route back for Rashford, and he's continued to shine under Hansi Flick at Barcelona.",
      "Rashford has earned his way back into the England squad, bagging seven goals and providing 11 assists in 25 appearances for the Catalan giants this season.",
      "Hargreaves believes too much pressure was heaped on Rashford to be United's talisman during his formative years and is hopeful that both he and Kobbie Mainoo can be handed fresh opportunities under a new manager following Amorim's dismissal.",
      "Hargreaves told TNT Sport: \"I hope that Marcus comes back because he's a special player. I don't know what happened between Marcus and Ruben, but I don't think there's any denying his talent.",
      "\"I don't think Marcus should've been in a position where he shouldered all the weight for everything.",
      "\"In our team, he would've been the third or fourth guy, so he wouldn't have to bare all the responsibility because a lot of that would've been taken off his shoulders.\"",
      "The former United midfielder continued: \"There was too much emphasis on these young guys to be the main man, and they should never have found themselves in that position at just 20 years of age.",
      "\"They needed a striker who was 26-28 years old and then the youngsters could have learned the ropes like everyone did previously at the club.",
      "\"I think Marcus is a super talent and the club could use him. And with Kobbie (Mainoo), I think he'll be straight back into the team with the side playing a back four.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher is set to oversee the squad for their journey to Burnley and might be accompanied by Jonny Evans, with United potentially approaching him regarding a coaching position.",
      "The club are currently considering appointing a more seasoned interim manager until the season concludes, given Fletcher's lack of managerial experience, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick amongst those being considered.",

      "Premier League clubs are busy searching for opportunistic deals as the January transfer window heats up. The top-flight sides will be looking to add to their squads just months after a record-breaking summer saw the league spend an eye-watering £3billion on new players.",
      "While clubs prioritise the summer to bring in major recruits, January provides a chance to start rebuilding earlier. Manchester City accounted for almost half of the Premier League ’s £370m spend last winter as Pep Guardiola set about freshening up his squad.",
      "A club’s transfer budget does not solely depend on the wealth of their owners but also on ensuring compliance with profit and sustainability rules (PSR). Additionally, teams aiming to qualify for European competition must consider UEFA’s squad cost ratio (SCR).",
      "PSR limits losses to £105million over a three-year period, which is lowered by £22m for every year a club is outside the Premier League. Meanwhile, SCR allows clubs to spend up to 70 per cent of their revenue on squad-related costs.",
      "Despite having to contend with the financial rules, the January window provides teams with an opportunity to strengthen for the short and long term. Manchester City are reportedly closing in on a deal for Bournemouth ’s Antoine Semenyo, who has a £65m release clause, as Guardiola’s side attempt to catch league leaders Arsenal, following on from their busy January window last year.",
      "The Gunners spent heavily in the summer to provide Mikel Arteta with a level of squad depth that could finally see the club clinch the title. Arsenal spent around £250m on new recruits in the previous window but could still spend another £100m if required this month, according to football finance expert Kieran Maguire.",
      "He added: \"So if Arsenal wanted to spend, they could spend far in excess of £100million. I think the issue is whether players are available who are not cup-tied from a Champions League point of view.",
      "\"Arsenal are very strong financially. Their losses in the last couple of years were £70m and under the Premier League rules you are allowed to lose £105m. So again, they have got plenty of headroom. A very smart club.\"",
      "Not all clubs will be able to match Arsenal’s January budget. Aston Villa, sitting third in the table have previously made smart signings in the New Year under Unai Emery - a list that includes Morgan Rogers, Jhon Duran and Marcus Rashford - and have welcomed young winger Alysson from Gremio. However, as demonstrated by their quiet summer, Villa will be wary of complying with financial rules, rather than spending big to mount a title challenge.",
      "Manchester United may not be enjoying the same type of success as Villa but the Red Devils still have the capacity to bolster their squad this month. Despite sacking manager Ruben Amorim earlier this week and having no European football, United could potentially spend £100m on new signings.",
      "\"Again, from an SCR point of view, which is the new rules which are kicking in, [United are] spending around half their revenue on wages. So they've got huge capacity,\" Maguire explained. \"It's then a case of, can they spend the money?",
      "\"Well, yes, they've got a lot of debt but they're still well within their overdraft limit. What Manchester United tend to do is to buy players on credit. So they owe £466m in outstanding transfer fees for players that they've signed in the past.",
      "\"I think that's more of an issue for the summer of 2026 rather than January. If they spend £100m in January, they'll be spreading that over three or four years. So from a cash point of view, it's not really going to make a difference. If that's the difference between Champions League and not Champions League, they've got to go for it if it's going to improve the squad.\"",
      "Liverpool were the biggest spenders in the last transfer window, spending more than £100m each on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak during an expensive summer. The Reds have fallen below expectations so far this season but could stil turn to the transfer market to help rescue the current campaign.",
      "\"Liverpool have got the benefit of, yes, they had a spectacular summer of 2025, but if you take a look at their losses in the two previous years, they were never in danger of breaching PSR,\" Maguire said.",
      "However, the reigning Premier League champions have the added dilemma of dealing with Mohamed Salah ’s future. The star forward has 18 months remaining on his contract but had been outspoken about losing his place in the team shortly before representing Egypt at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "On Salah’s situation, Maguire added: \"Well, his wages are probably going to be something like £15m a year. So, if he left he would free up the wage budget. On top of that, because he's been there so long, effectively any money that they get is pure profit. And that goes into your top line.\"",
      "Chelsea appear unlikely to make any major signings as they close in on a replacement for manager Enzo Maresca. However, both Newcastle and Tottenham reportedly have healthy transfer budgets this month, while Bournemouth and Brighton are also in the market for new players.",
      "At the other end of the table, Burnley will be looking to add to their squad to help in their fight against relegation. Meanwhile, Nottingham Forest and West Ham will be searching for new signings as they aim to move away from the drop zone, having already brought in a new striker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The demands on the next manager of Manchester United are set to be like no other. Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday after a fallout with United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, with the breakdown in their relationship in part down to disagreements over the Red Devils' formation.",
      "Amorim's unwillingness to permanently move away from his preferred 3-4-3 formation left Old Trafford chiefs frustrated, especially after last week's dire 1-1 draw at home to then-winless Wolves. The former Sporting Lisbon boss felt that Wilcox, with his demand to be more tactical flexible, was interfering his role as head coach.",
      "In his now infamous post-match press conference at Elland Road, Amorim mentioned 'the sporting director' when naming people who need to focus on 'their jobs' and leave the coaching to him. Less than 24 hours later, the Portuguese was sacked. United have now begun their search for a new manager, as they weigh up whether to install a caretaker or make a permanent appointment.",
      "It's likely that whoever takes charge will be advised - or told - to line up with four defenders as opposed to three, and play in the 'game model' that Wilcox has frequently spoken about. But more defenders means less attacking players.",
      "That won't be good news for one of Bryan Mbeumo or Amad. Mbeumo arrived at United this summer in a transfer deal worth up to £71million and he showed promising signs before heading to represent Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "As for Amad, he's been with the Red Devils since 2020 and will cost a total of £37m if all add-ons are paid. Both players prefer to play on the right wing, cutting inside on their stronger left foot.",
      "Should United switch to 4-3-3, a system which Wilcox is a fan of from his time in Manchester City's academy, only one of them can play in their preferred role. The new manager will have to weigh up whether to prioritise Amad's creativity and potential or Mbeumo's eye for goal and proven Premier League output.",
      "Amorim used them in the same line-up by putting Amad at wing-back and Mbeumo in the front three. However, Amad's lack of defensive nous saw him regularly targeted by opponents while Mbeumo often found himself crowded out in attack.",
      "Who should Manchester United appoint as their new manager? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "Another way to fit them into the same XI would be to play Amad as a No.10 - but Bruno Fernandes will almost certainly occupy that role when he returns from injury. For now, both Amad and Mbeumo are still at AFCON but when they return it's a conundrum that will need solving.",
      "Mbeumo's Cameroon face hosts Morocco in the quarter-finals on Friday while Amad's Ivory Coast play Burkina Faso in the round of 16 on Tuesday. United's next game is at Burnley on Wednesday. Then they'll welcome Brighton on Sunday in the FA Cup third round.",
      "Under-18s boss Darren Fletcher has been put in charge on an interim basis and he knows Amad from his time as assistant to Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag. But by the time they're both back, another man could be in the Old Trafford dugout.",

      "Manchester United will approach Jonny Evans over a coaching role under caretaker boss Darren Fletcher as he finalises his staff ahead of Wednesday's Premier League clash with Burnley.",
      "Fletcher has taken the reins after the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday, with little time to put together a support team ahead of the clash with the Clarets - in hat is the Scot's first senior head coach role.",
      "Evans, who left his role as United's head of loans and pathway just a month ago, could return as part of the first-team coaching staff and might be back in time to be involved against the Clarets. He is expected to stay on until the end of the season.",
      "Former United and Scotland midfielder Fletcher took training on Monday and will step up preparations for the visit to Turf Moor on Tuesday, with Under-21s head coach Travis Binnion and academy coach Alan Wright stepping up to form part of his first-team staff.",
      "Sacked head coach Amorim had brought a number of coaches with him from Sporting when he joined the club 14 months ago, but they - including assistant head coach Carlos Fernandes, first-team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira - all departed on Monday.",
      "The only member of the first-team coaching staff staying at Old Trafford in the wake of Amorim's departure is goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson. The 46-year-old has been at United for six years, having joined the club from Wednesday's opponents Burnley in late 2019.",
      "Evans retired at the end of the 2024-25 season having enjoyed two spells as a player at the club and his knowledge of United - and his proximity to the current first-team - is considered valuable. Evans also played with Fletcher - stepping up from his role as Under-18s head coach - at both United and West Brom.",
      "Fletcher was first-team coach under Erik ten Hag and previously served as the technical director at United. The club are also weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",
      "Solskjaer recently left his job at Besiktas and Carrick is out of work after leaving Middlesbrough. Both have experienced the Old Trafford hotseat before.",
      "Fletcher will hold his first press conference at 5pm on Tuesday. United sought Premier League approval to push the press conference back, with league guidelines usually insisting press conferences should start no later than 1.30pm the day before the game, or on a Friday if it is a weekend fixture.",

      "The hunt for Amorim's replacement has now begun. Darren Fletcher will assume caretaker responsibilities for tomorrow evening's Premier League fixture against newly-promoted Burnley at Turf Moor.",

      "During that tenure, he oversaw 168 matches, securing 91 victories, 37 draws and suffering 40 defeats. His final match in charge saw his side fall to a 4-1 away defeat to Watford in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim's exit from Manchester United was predictable and fuelled by frustration, according to his country's media. The Portuguese boss was sacked on Monday following a chaotic tenure at Old Trafford, where he had been heavily criticised for his tactics and results.",
      "Amorim's departure followed his side's 1-1 draw against Leeds United in the Premier League on Sunday, with the club currently sitting in sixth place in the table. United had won just two of their last six games, beating Newcastle on Boxing Day and Wolves away earlier in December 2025.",
      "During Amorim's time at United, he won 24 games, drew 18 and lost 21, giving him the worst win rate (31.9 per cent) of any permanent boss at Old Trafford. His record of 1.23 points per game in the Premier League is the lowest among all managers at United since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013.",
      "In addition to this poor form, the 40-year-old's final comments as manager stunned fans and critics alike as he stormed off after answering the media's question about the board's confidence in him. Amorim claimed he is \"just the manager\" of the club and everybody else needs to \"do their job\" in order for them to succeed.",
      "Here, the Portuguese media have reacted to Amorim's sacking and given their thoughts on their countryman's tenure in charge of one of the biggest clubs in England.",
      "Portuguese media outlet Record believes that Amorim's sacking was the \"predictable epilogue\" to something that had begun happening long before it was announced on Monday. They pointed to the heavy criticism faced by the boss regarding his tactics, including comments from club figures such as Gary Neville and Roy Keane.",
      "The publication claimed these United icons pushed the narrative that Amorim would \"never be the right man\" for the job and \"anticipated failure\" for the Portuguese manager. Despite all this, it couldn't be avoided that Amorim's \"stubbornness\" led him down a path that cost him \"time and credibility\" in Manchester as he refused to change his mind on aspects of his playing model that cost the club results.",
      "However, Record pointed out that numerous coaches with more experience than Amorim had failed at Old Trafford long before he did, citing the likes of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "The media outlet believes Amorim didn't succeed at United because he couldn't \"adapt\" under pressure. However, the club will continue to fail as it \"no longer recognises itself in the mirror,\" and has become a place where managers go to be sacked, not revered as successes.",
      "Portuguese publication A Bola was strong in their stance on Amorim's sacking, believing the 40-year-old \"dug his own grave\" consciously as he knew the situation at United was \"unsustainable.\"",
      "There is a belief that Amorim had differences with the scouting department regarding the idea that players had to be sold in order for transfer targets to be signed. They also questioned Neville's strong words against the former United manager and claimed the \"external pressure\" from club legends and other critics led to the club sacking Amorim to \"reduce the noise.\"",
      "A Bola also reported that United's head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, questioned the manager's choices following Fulham boss Marco Silva's explanation of his team's ability to counter the Red Devils' system. It is widely known that Amorim doesn't allow people to interfere in his tactics, and due to this stubbornness, it was only a matter of time before risk outweighed results at United.",
      "From a poll run by A Bola, where they asked if people were surprised by Amorim's exit, 39.2 per cent believed the club were better off keeping him. However, a huge 51 per cent were of the opinion that his strong words after the Leeds draw just confirmed the inevitable that he would depart Man United.",
      "A few readers left their own thoughts underneath the poll, with one writing: \"I don't know how it lasted so long with such poor results.\"",
      "Another added: \"With all that 'tactical stubbornness,' it was only a matter of time.\" One Amorim fan urged him to return to Sporting CP as they claimed the team is \"still the same,\" meanwhile, another put him forward for the Benfica job in the future.",
      "One reader was strong in his criticism of Amorim, writing: \"That's what I've been expecting for a long time, because he was quite ambitious and showed a lack of principles by abandoning Sporting; he got what he deserved. He'll never return to Sporting again; that would be rewarding a lawbreaker. Get a job at your club as an assistant.\"",
      "Overall, it seems that Portugal were anticipating Amorim's exit from United and believe it to be a mixture of the manager's stubborn nature alongside the club's unwillingness to back their leaders.",

      "Ruben Amorim's sacking means it is all change once again at Manchester United. The Portuguese head coach was dismissed on Monday, bringing to an end his poor spell in charge.",
      "Amorim departs with the worst record of any Red Devils manager in the Premier League era, as well as their lowest ever finish, 15th last season. The issues that eventually counted against him were evident in the early days. Amorim was determined to play his way, according to his philosophy. That meant the implementation of a 3-4-3 formation and almost no pragmatism. That challenged the players, many of whom were playing the system for the first time. Others were also just not cut out for certain roles.",
      "Nevertheless he persevered, but results didn't come. There were numerous low points and very few players have come out of the Amorim-era with their stock enhanced. Now though there are new beginnings, albeit several men may occupy the dugout in the coming months such is United's succession planning.",
      "Darren Fletcher will come in initially, then we'll have a caretaker until the end of the season before they go after the next Mr.Right in the summer. Whoever that will be.",
      "But there's no doubt, from a playing point of view, that some players may privately be happy to see the back of Amorim. Others maybe less so. We take a look at how movement in the dugout changes the landscape on the red side of Manchester with some individuals standing to benefit whilst others may face questions or uncertain futures.",
      "No player endured a decline from the Erik ten Hag tenure to the Amorim one quite like the midfielder. Mainoo was scoring goals in the FA Cup final, leading to England exploits, when the Dutchman was in charge. He looked accomplished, confident and the man to spearhead the future of the club.",
      "Amorim didn't see it that way and minutes became hard to come by for the academy star, so much so that moves away were consistently speculated. He's not started a Premier League game this season, but that could now be about to change with many inside the club fully believing in his talents.",
      "Even during the lows under Amorim the playmaker was one man who continued to stand up. Surprising then that he was linked with a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia, yet he remains and is still the talisman at Old Trafford. His issues this season have been the deeper role he's had to accept. Playing as part of the two-man midfield - it ultimately stunted what he could offer in the final third. A lot of that was down to the lack of a 10 spot in Amorim's formation, but a new manager may likely revert to a system that allows Fernandes to be front and centre and operating in his best position.",
      "You name them and they're probably happy. With the possible exception of Patrick Dorgu, who was signed under Amorim's watch. All of the players at United were bought in as conventional full-backs. So when they were asked to play as wing-backs, a very specific position, it was a steep learning curve.",
      "Some adapted better than others, but it wasn't natural. So the likes of Luke Shaw, Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui may be happy knowing that they're set to revert back to remits that they're far more comfortable with. And players like Amad, fundamentally attacking players, will also know that there's little danger of them being transitioned into wing-backs.",
      "Another big decision from the Ineos supremo and another one that he's got wrong. Ratcliffe's report card is looking worse with each passing call. He backed Ten Hag, sacked Ten Hag, now he's sacked Amorim. This is ultimately a man with sporting experience but no football experience, and sooner rather than later people will question whether he's competent enough to make the big decisions.",
      "Its worth remembering that the men he's put in place to run the club, Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, are operating with his say so. You thought he needed to get the Amorim appointment right - well this next hire may prove the making or not of his ownership.",
      "This could go two ways - and it depends what Rashford is thinking. Part of him may long for a return to Manchester and the sacking of Amorim could aid that. But equally those within his circle have claimed that a move to Barcelona is his dream. He's there on loan and was eyeing a permanent move. Any new manager in the door may see his exploits in Spain and think 'no, he's a player I can work with', and that may curtail a move to La Liga.",
      "Ratcliffe has presided over huge redundancies. Claiming that, as his mother said, if you look after the pennies the pounds look after themselves. So seemingly a £10million pay-off wasn't on the agenda, but that's what its cost to get rid of Amorim. Plenty questioned how United spent so much on players in the summer and now they've had to find more cash to change their head coach. Big clubs seem to be able to circumnavigate the PSR dangers, but even still, this was not budgeted for.",

      "Ruben Amorim left Manchester United with a £10million pay-off on Monday after he was sacked as head coach following just 14 months in his role - a decision that has ultimately cost the club dear.",
      "Tensions behind the scenes came to a head with Amorim and Director of Football Jason Wilcox clashing on several issues, including his style of play. The Portuguese head coach went public with some of his frustrations after Sunday's draw at Leeds and was subsequently given his marching orders less than 24 hours later.",
      "His dismissal means that United spent a staggering £27m to hire and then fire Amorim. He was identified as the man to replace Erik ten Hag following an impressive spell in charge of Sporting Lisbon. In the winter of 2024 United bought out his contract in Lisbon for £8.3m and then paid another £900,000 so he could start work early. When he arrived he signed a £6.5m-a-year deal, which was set to keep him in Manchester until June 2027.",
      "United will also have to compensate the five-man backroom team who followed him from Portugal, reports the Daily Mail. History will not look kindly on the investment with Amorim winning just 25 of his 63 games at the helm, while he also presided over the team's lowest ever finish in the Premier League era.",
      "He leaves the club in sixth, just three points off the top four. However performances over recent weeks have continued to fall below the necessary standards, especially in the home draws with West Ham and Wolves. Amorim had shown some tactically flexibility recently, but has reverted back to his 3-4-3 formation, which has not proved successful.",
      "United have stated that former player and U18s coach Darren Fletcher has been installed as caretaker manager for Wednesday night's trip to Burnley. United hope to name an interim boss until the end of the season before appointing a permanent boss come the summer.",
      "Several names have been banded about but Gary Neville has insisted that the Red Devils need to get someone in who reflects the club's DNA having grown frustrated with several of their picks in the dugout.",
      "\"United have got to a point where they need a manager who fits the DNA of the football club. Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe United should change for anybody. The club has to find a manager who has got experience and who's willing to play fast entertaining, attacking and aggressive football.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United gave Ruben Amorim his marching orders on Monday morning, leaving the club in search of a new leader for their long-term future. Despite being just three points shy of fourth place, Amorim's tenure at Old Trafford was abruptly ended.",
      "Such is the fleeting nature of a modern-day manager's career. Now, the focus shifts to finding Amorim's replacement, with fans hoping the appointment will be someone who can usher in a new era for United. With the futures of Marcus Rashford, Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee hanging in the balance, the next appointment will have significant implications on incoming and outgoing transfers, as well as the team's playing style.",
      "Like Amorim, Glasner favours wing-backs, but his approach differs slightly. The Crystal Palace boss employs a box midfield - two midfielders in a double pivot with two attacking midfielders ahead of them, all supporting a lone striker.",
      "In contrast, Amorim opted for a front three consisting of two wingers and a striker.",
      "Lammens has firmly established himself as United's first-choice goalkeeper recently and appears set to be David de Gea's long-term successor. It seems unlikely that Glasner would bring in a new keeper or promote Andre Onana upon his return from loan.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, despite currently nursing an injury, is a shoo-in for the United team when fit, and Glasner would be thrilled to have a player of the Dutchman's stature.",
      "Marc Guehi, whose contract expires this summer, has been linked with Liverpool and Manchester City. If Glasner takes the reins at United, it's highly probable that he would want Guehi to follow him and join United on a free transfer.",
      "Given his talent, this would be a phenomenal acquisition. Lisandro Martinez, who has become a key component of the United setup, would round off a formidable defensive trio.",
      "As previously noted, Glasner employs a similar system, but his formation is a 3-4-2-1, which includes a double midfield pivot and two wing-backs in the centre of the pitch. The responsibilities of Patrick Dorgu and Amad Diallo will be to widen the field and create more room for the two tens behind the striker.",
      "In addition to this, they'll provide opportunities for goal creation from the flanks for the main striker. Alternatively, Glasner might consider bringing Daniel Muñoz over from Palace to fill Amad's position, given his successful stint at Selhurst Park.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been rumoured to be on his way out of United due to a lack of game time under Amorim and with the World Cup looming, he needs to prove his mettle. With Glasner in charge, it's plausible that Mainoo might stay at the club and form a double pivot with Adam Wharton.",
      "Wharton is one of Europe's most promising talents but would cost United a hefty £100m - a price that could be justified. Wharton could be the spark that turns defence into attack, sitting deep and distributing the ball forward.",
      "Mainoo, an exceptional dribbler, could provide another link between defence and attack, receiving the ball on the half-turn and feeding the two attacking midfielders ahead of him.",
      "One drawback to Mainoo is his lack of physicality; he's not a pure defensive midfielder and while Wharton excels in this area, Glasner might want someone with more presence in the centre of the pitch. With Casemiro likely to depart in the summer, if Glasner can unlock Ugarte's potential, he could make a fantastic partner for Wharton.",
      "This could easily have been Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, or any combination of these four players, who are all capable of filling these roles. All four are incredibly creative and pose a threat when given space, especially if Glasner's system were to stretch the opposition defence with Dorgu and Amad.",
      "First though, United must retain Fernandes, who Glasner would undoubtedly relish the opportunity to work with.",
      "The pièce de résistance.",
      "One of the Premier League's top strikers, Mateta boasts a formidable physical presence and is a serious threat in the box. If he can consistently find the back of the net at Palace, just think what he could achieve with Fernandes providing him with opportunities every match.",
      "He's another one of Glasner's players and it's likely he'd make an immediate impact if he also transferred to Old Trafford. Now a French international, the 28-year-old would probably command a fee in the region of £50m and has been frequently linked with a move away recently.",
      "New signings: Marc Guehi, Adam Wharton and Jean-Phillipe Mateta.",
      "Manchester United's dream XI under Oliver Glasner: Lammens; Guehi, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Mainoo, Wharton, Dorgu; Fernandes, Mount; Mateta.",

      "It’s been a busy 24 hours at Manchester United with the club announcing the sacking of Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese coach was shown the door on Monday morning, following the weekend’s 1-1 draw with Leeds and his comments after that game.",
      "For United’s hierarchy, work will be going on behind the scenes to find a replacement, with Darren Fletcher currently in interim charge. He is expected to take the team for their Premier League game away at Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "As well as the search for a new manager, and games coming thick and fast, we are also now into the January transfer window. United have been linked with potential incomings and outgoings for the last few months, and work is likely to still be going on behind the scenes.",
      "With that in mind, here is a look at some of the latest transfer news and rumours from in and around Old Trafford.",
      "The departure of Amorim could potentially have an impact on the future of United players in the squad during the January transfer window. The Daily Mail report that Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte were all ‘desperate’ to leave Old Trafford before the end of the month had the manager still been in charge.",
      "All three players struggled for regular game time under the Portuguese coach and had been linked with moves away from the club. Napoli have been strongly linked with an interest in Mainoo, while Roma were said to be making a move for Zirkzee.",
      "Those potential exits could now however be potentially put on hold given Amorim’s exit from the club.",
      "United may want to bide their time and a new manager is likely to want to take a closer look at his squad before making any transfer decisions. The trio could also see it as an opportunity to revive their Old Trafford careers.",
      "The agent of United-linked Yehor Yarmolyuk has spoken out about his client's future, amid reported interest from United. last year, it was reported that the Brentford midfielder had been added to a list of potential targets as the club look to strengthen their midfield.",
      "However, speaking to TalkSPORT, Vadim Shablii has hinted that the player is not looking for a move in January. \"Right now, Yehor is in the right place, and all his thoughts are focused on becoming an indispensable player and a leader in Brentford’s starting XI,” he said.",
      "\"During this summer transfer window, there was interest in him from clubs in Italy, Germany, and, of course, England — but everything has its time,\" Shablii continued.",
      "\"He is happy to be at Brentford at the moment, but I am certain that there will be even greater interest in him in the future.\"",

      "Manchester United are on the lookout for their next boss and Fulham believe they could get a call for Marco Silva, who is among the names being linked with the vacancy.",
      "He was linked to the United job before his fellow countryman Ruben Amorim took it in November 2024, but he was given his marching orders on Monday. His sacking means that Ineos are looking for the second new manager of their ownership.",
      "Silva took the job at Fulham when they were in the Championship, leading them to the title before establishing them as a Premier League club once again. His work has impressed plenty of onlookers and he was linked with a move to Saudi Arabia back in the summer.",
      "The Portuguese head coach, who will be out of contract in the summer, has yet to give a response to the offer of a three-and-a-half-year contract that was put to him by the Fulham hierarchy back in November. That has fuelled suggestions he will leave when the season ends.",
      "It has not gone unnoticed that Silva is yet to commit his future to Fulham and the club are braced for an approach from those in Manchester - either in the summer or sooner, reports The Sun.",
      "The 48-year-old has backed away from speaking publicly about his future or his next move, but has made it clear that remaining with Fulham is not purely about wages. He wants to see if the club will be able to match his ambition going forward after several years in the top flight.",
      "Back in the summer, with Fulham struggling to get signings in, he admitted it was \"not ideal\" before claiming: \"I didn't expect us to be this passive. I knew what I wanted and the plan was there but it hasn't happened. Right now we need to reinforce. In some positions we are very short. Did I expect it? Of course not, but the market is the market.\"",

      "The Austrian is also out of contract in the summer and he's been vocal about some of his frustrations with how the Eagles have gone about their business. Plenty expect him to move on and his situation means that United are primed to pounce.",

      "Oliver Glasner is reportedly one of the early favourites to take over from Amorim permanently.",
      "Known for his outspoken nature throughout his managerial career, Glasner could potentially cause some caution within the Old Trafford hierarchy, especially when considering Amorim's previous frustrations about being treated as a 'coach' rather than a 'manager'.",
      "Back in November 2020, Glasner - who was then seen as a reserved figure - publicly criticised the management at his former club, Wolfsburg. Glasner took a swipe at their sporting director Jorg Schmadtke, who later played a role in Liverpool's signings of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "\"One of our targets was to bring in a player with pace and deep runs,\" Glasner said. \"We didn't manage to do that, despite talking about it for months.\"",
      "Schmadtke retaliated in an interview, labelling Glasner's ideas 'unrealistic'. The duo's relationship eventually deteriorated and, despite leading Wolfsburg to the Champions League, Glasner left for Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Similarly, during his tenure at Crystal Palace, Glasner has not shied away from expressing his discontent. The FA Cup-winning manager has repeatedly voiced his frustration at the Eagles' lack of investment ahead of European competition.",
      "\"I would have wished for a little bit more backing, yes,\" Glasner said back in November. \"I think in January we just correct what we failed to do in the summer. By January, we have played 60/65 per cent of the season... Let's see.\"",
      "There were also reports last year that the Palace manager 'threatened' to leave the Eagles if they sold defender Marc Guehi on deadline day last summer. That's something which Glasner went on to deny.",
      "England star Guehi was on the brink of signing for Liverpool, before that deal was abruptly called off. Such actions might serve as a warning to United executives Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, but Amorim's comments could also be a cautionary note for Glasner.",
      "Amorim recently expressed frustration over his inability to implement his preferred formation, with Glasner also favouring a setup with three central defenders.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play our perfect 3-4-3, that we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" Amorim said. \"I'm starting to understand that's not going to happen. Maybe now I have to adapt.\"",

      "It follows the sacking of Ruben Amorim which was announced on Monday morning, less than 24 hours after the Red Devils drew 1-1 away to Leeds. Fletcher previously served as an assistant to ex-United boss Erik ten Hag before being appointed as head coach of the club's under-18s side in July.",
      "But now the Scot will make the step up for at least one game, as the Old Trafford hierarchy deliberate over their next move. Ferguson, whether he's at Turf Moor or sat in his living room, will be watching proudly as Fletcher leads United for the first time.",
      "In an interview with West Bromwich Albion's media team in 2017, Ferguson explained how he got Fletcher working closely with youth coach Warren Joyce amid fears that the former midfielder wouldn't ever be able to return to the pitch, having been diagnosed with chronic bowel disease in 2011.",
      "\"I'm starting to think maybe he’s not going to make it,\" Ferguson recalled. \"I started preparing him along the lines that he could become a coach with us because that was, without question, my long-term view of it.",
      "\"They were losing 1-0 at Altrincham, so I went into the dressing room at half-time because I wasn't particularly pleased. Darren was doing the motivation, tactics, and Warren had given him that head to do that. It was fantastic.",
      "\"I'll always remember he says, 'If you're playing for Manchester United, there's an expectation, son, that you're not showing out there. If you can't do it in a reserve game you've absolutely no chance of playing for Alex Ferguson",

      "The former United midfielder oversaw a smaller training session on Monday but will step up preparations for the visit to Turf Moor today. Under-21s head coach Travis Binnion and academy coach Alan Wright, who recently joined from Manchester City, will also step up to form part of Fletcher's first-team staff.",
      "Amorim brought an army of coaches with him from Sporting, and they all departed the club on Monday. They include assistant head coach Carlos Fernandes, first-team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The only member of the first-team coaching staff staying at Old Trafford in the wake of Amorim's departure is goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson. The 46-year-old has been at United for six years, having joined the club from Wednesday's opponents Burnley in late 2019.",
      "Evans, who left his role as United's head of loans and pathway just a month ago, could return as part of the first-team coaching staff and might be back in time to be involved against the Clarets. He is expected to stay on until the end of the season.",
      "The centre-back retired at the end of the 2024/25 season after two spells at the club as a player and his knowledge of United is considered valuable. Evans played with Fletcher, who will get a chance to show his credentials this week after stepping up from his role as Under-18s head coach.",
      "Fletcher was a first-team coach under Erik ten Hag and had previously served as the technical director at United. This is his first experience in management, and as a result, the club are weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",

      "Fletcher will hold his first press conference at the later time of 5pm on Tuesday. United sought Premier League approval to push the press conference back, with league guidelines usually insisting press conferences should start no later than 1.30pm the day before the game, or on a Friday if it is a weekend fixture.",
      "Fletcher is keen to get his feet under the table today and sort out the identity of his staff and plans for the trip to Turf Moor, before then undertaking his round of media engagements.",

      "Manchester United have no plans to change their approach to the January transfer window in the wake of Ruben Amorim's sudden departure as head coach on Monday morning. United's spending plans were a source of conflict between Amorim and technical director Jason Wilcox in the final weeks of the Portuguese's reign at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim had said in December that the club would consider making a move for a player in the January window, and they were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo, who had a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract.",
      "United would have paid that had the 25-year-old opted to move to Old Trafford, but Semenyo has opted for a move to Manchester City instead. That led a downbeat Amorim to say on Friday there were \"no conversations\" about signing players in January as he suggested the squad would be unchanged during the window.",
      "The 40-year-old was understood to be frustrated that the money earmarked for Semenyo couldn't be spent elsewhere, with the head coach keen to strengthen his midfield options as he harboured doubts over Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo. United insist Amorim was on board with the decision to focus resources on signing three attackers in the summer rather than prioritising a midfielder.",
      "The midfield will be the subject of investment this year, but it is expected that those plans will only accelerate in the summer window. United have focused on Premier League-proven signings recently and hold an interest in Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson.",
      "Sources insist that the move for Semenyo aligns with the approach to the mid-season window, in which money would only be spent on a long-term target. United retained their interest in the forward from last summer and had to act now as his release clause made a departure from Bournemouth inevitable.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and director of football Jason Wilcox continue to lead on the transfer window and will stick to the strategy of focusing on long-term targets.",

      "It's fair to say there wasn't a slide for this in the PowerPoint presentation for 'Project 150', the grandiose title Ineos have come up with to take Manchester United back to the top of English football. Unveiled in September 2024, Project 150 is the stated aim of United winning the league in their 150th anniversary season of 2027/28. Appointing a new head coach 15 months later, after a complete breakdown in relations, wasn't part of the plan.",
      "As much as key figures around Old Trafford are keen to pin the blame on Ruben Amorim for what has happened recently, Ratcliffe and his key lieutenants can't escape scot free either. They have botched the first major decision the new football structure had to make and it feels like they are back to square one. Ratcliffe has now cycled through a director of football and a head coach already. It's not a great look.",
      "Amorim's stubborn refusal to adapt and his dull football turned admirers into doubters in the stands this season, but now he has gone the spotlight will fall once again on Ineos. They have blundered off the pitch with two brutal rounds of redundancies and a string of penny-pinching measures, and have now got it wrong when it comes to the football again as well.",
      "Faith is running in short supply in Ratcliffe and his band of merry men. The 73-year-old billionaire and his football leadership team were supposed to be the antidote to the Glazers, but they haven't exactly been a breath of fresh air.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada was the man who pushed hardest of all for Amorim's appointment. He is a distinctly different figure from the holders of that office under the Glazer rule, and his football acumen is to be welcomed; however, this hasn't been a good start.",
      "Likewise Jason Wilcox. He impressed Ineos early on and his desire to try and make things work with Amorim despite recent clashes has been welcomed. The former Manchester City academy director assumed greater power when Dan Ashworth left but he will know the next managerial appointment is a big one.",
      "But Ratcliffe is the man who might feel the spotlight harshest of all. His relationship with supporters has quickly soured and all of those mentioned are his appointments. Less than three months ago he said he wanted Amorim to get three years. In the end, he didn't last another three months.",
      "He sacked Ashworth just months after calling him the best sporting director in the world. That fiasco cost United £4.1million and the barmy decision to hand Erik ten Hag a new contract and sack him within months was a £14.5million blunder. This summer, he kept faith with Amorim, handed him a £230million war chest and has now sacked him.",
      "Ratcliffe can talk the talk, but there is little evidence he can walk the walk, and he is finding out the hard way that football is a business unlike any other. He might be a petrochemicals billionaire, but right now he looks like a football pauper.",
      "He has insisted he has appointed people to run the football side of the business for him. Ratcliffe takes an interest and has detailed his straight-talking chats with Amorim, but he tries to let the experts run the show. It was Berrada and Wilcox who led the way on Amorim's sacking.",
      "Ratcliffe will know that's something that reflects poorly on the lot of them, however. United will take their time now to get an appointment right, waiting for the summer if that is considered the best option.",
      "Just after getting the keys to Old Trafford, Ratcliffe reflected on the churn of managers at the club and pointed the finger of blame at the structure around them.",
      "\"I'm not going to comment on Erik ten Hag because I think it would be inappropriate to do that,\" he said in February 2024. \"But what I think is relevant to the question or the answer is if you look at the 11 years since David Gill and Sir Alex stepped down, there have been a whole series of coaches, some of whom were very good, and none of them have been successful or survived for very long, which I think is correct. And you can't blame all the coaches. The only conclusion you can draw is the environment in which they were working in didn't work.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has altered the structure only to see two more coaches fail, one who he handed a new contract to and one who he appointed in the first place. It's a track record to set alarm bells ringing.",
      "Amorim might be gone, but the structure will survive. Now it has to prove it isn't the problem by getting the appointment of the next head coach just right.",

      "Following the exit of Ruben Amorim after his explosive post-match comments in the wake of Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds United, the search is on to appoint a new Man United head coach",
      "Under-18s head coach Darren Fletcher will take interim charge and is set to hold his first press conference at 5pm later today, ahead of United's trip to Burnley. With regard to potential long-term successors, Oliver Glasner has emerged as the early favourite as he is expected to depart Crystal Palace at the end of the season.",

      "We are set to hear from new Manchester United interim head coach Darren Fletcher at 5pm today.",
      "The focus of the press conference should be on Wednesday's clash away at Burnley, but it will almost certainly be dominated by Ruben Amorim and new manager chat.",
      "The 41-year-old does look set for an immediate boost with one of Amorim's final acts in charge, revealing that Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount could return from injury at Turf Moor. Updates on their respective conditions will almost certainly arrive in a few hours.",

      "Seeing lot of hear say stories this morning on Amorim, players + heirachy, arguments etc. This is normal - I would be annoyed if there weren’t. You need an environment where difficult conversations were had, players wanting to win!",
      "This is a regular occurrence in Any dressing room, training pitch wanting to be successful !!! Amorim is a good man/manager and he will come again - the club have made the decision to look elsewhere. There’s been progress built on last season…but not enough in enough areas.",
      "There will be more pressure now on the players and they have to step up and show spirit, fight and be brave with the ball to get through this moment in the season.",
      "What an opportunity for Darren Fletcher - the players will respond to him and if we see a bit of Darren Fletcher in the teams performance that will be a positive step.",
      "Eddie Howe has stated he is committed to Newcastle United amid Manchester United links.",
      "Would anything tempt me away? No, not at this current time. The most important thing is happiness in the role and relationships with people around me.",
      "That’s not always been consistently good so I think things can change at any club. But at the moment I’m very happy. We have made some great appointments in the key positions that needed filled.",
      "I’m happy as long as I can be the best version of myself to help the club, and we have unity. I have an unbelievable relationship with the board and I consider myself very lucky to have that.",
      "Very few managers have the time, the trust, the confidence…if you have all of those things you have a higher chance of being successful. I’m really happy at the moment and hopefully that stays for a long time.",
      "Manchester United are set to approach Jonny Evans over a coaching role under Darren Fletcher as the Scot finalises his staff for Wednesday's Premier League fixture with Burnley.",
      "The defender left his role at United in December having retired earlier in the year, though he could be set for a swift return.",
      "Fletcher has been appointed interim head coach at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ruben Amorim on Monday and that has left him little time to put together a team to support him in what is his first senior head coach role.",
      "Disagreements with several members of the Manchester United hierarchy and a training ground bust-up with Lisandro Martinez all took place in the lead up to Ruben Amorim being sacked.",
      "According to The Athletic, tensions between Jason Wilcox and Amorim boiled over during a meeting regarding transfers and tactics.",
      "It has also been claimed that the former and Sir Jim Ratcliffe wanted Amorim to switch to a back four. He was also involved in a heated confrontation with Martinez at Carrington in December.",
      "The defender felt he was ready to be in the starting XI again and was being overlooked by Amorim and made his feelings clear in what was described as an \"intense\" manner.",
      "While Manchester United are continuing their hunt for a new manager, it has been all but confirmed that Liam Rosenior will replace Enzo Maresca at Chelsea.",

      "They were Club World Cup champions and it's an honour for me to be associated with a club like that.",
      "Now, on this day, it looks like I'm going to be the next manager of that football club.",
      "Manchester United's plans for the January transfer window have not changed despite the sacking of Ruben Amorim, according to the Athletic.",
      "It has been claimed in their latest report that, as things stand, the expectation is that United enter the January market and will instead look to do business this summer.",
      "The winter trading period was never ear-marked as a month to make signings with the pursuit of Antoine Semenyo a market opportunity. Following his decision to join Manchester City, United opted against moving onto other targets for this month.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is the latest name to emerge as a serious contender for the Manchester United job.",
      "According to The Sun, the Cottagers are braced for an approach from United with his current deal set to expire in the summer.",
      "Silva was offered a new contract late last year but he is yet to provide a firm response. Ruben Amorim being sacked has since placed Fulham on red alert to the potential of losing their manager.",

      "According to talkSPORT, United will have to pay a further £10.05million on top of the £7.8m he has already earned as Amorim still had 18 months remaining on his contract. In total, his United tenure will cost the club £27.35m.",
      "In case you missed it, Oliver Glasner has already revealed his thoughts on potentially becoming Manchester United manager when asked about the role back in September.",
      "I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.",
      "The Crystal Palace boss has recently grown frustrated at Selhurst Park with a lack of summer signings leaving him with a depleted squad to compete across several competitions.",
      "Hello and welcome back to MEN Sports' Manchester United next manager live blog!",
      "Following the shock news of Ruben Amorim's departure on Monday morning, plenty of reaction and rumours have been covered. The latest of those have seen Ole Gunnar Solskaer linked to a sensational return to Old Trafford.",
      "Oliver Glasner remains the favourite to take over on a permanent basis, though interim boss Darren Fletcher taking the reigns has not been ruled out if he impressess over the next few weeks.",
      "That’s all for tonight, folks. Thanks for following our live coverage.",
      "We’ll be back tomorrow - catch you then!",
      "The Mirror claim Man United's hierarchy are split over who should be appointed as the next manager. Owners the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe have begun the search for a new boss following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "However, those in charge at Old Trafford remain undecided on whether to make an appointment now or wait until the summer.",
      "It was in October that Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to give Ruben Amorim three years to prove he is a \"great coach\". In the end, he didn't even get another three months. The man appointed as Manchester United's first head coach was sacked less than 19 hours after demanding to be the manager instead.",
      "What happened at Leeds looks to have been the final straw but conflict has been building for weeks, if not months. Amorim entered his press conference on Friday with a face like thunder and that stemmed from a meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox earlier that day in which there was a clash between the pair.",
      "Amorim then poured fuel on the fire by refusing to answer questions as to why he had recently said he wouldn't get the \"time or money\" to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\".",
      "Read more here.",
      "Manchester United endured a frosty end with their relationship with Ruben Amorim before deciding to sack the head coach after their draw with Leeds. But they may not be free from tension, depending on who they appoint.",
      "In November 2020, after being recognised as a quiet character, Glasner spoke out against the hierarchy of then-employers, Wolfsburg. The Austrian took aim at sporting director Jorg Schmadtke - who later helped sign Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch for Liverpool.",
      "\"One of our targets was to bring in a player with pace and deep runs,\" Glasner said. \"We didn't manage to do that, despite talking about it for months.\"",
      "Read more here.",
      "Manchester United are comfortable with Darren Fletcher in charge of first-team affairs for more than just one game as they weigh up their options over a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim. Former midfielder Fletcher will officially take charge of United's Premier League trip to Burnley on Wednesday night and is expected to remain in the dugout for the FA Cup tie with Brighton on Sunday.",
      "The 41-year-old oversaw a smaller training session, mostly comprising academy players, on Monday morning, with those involved in the match against Leeds on Sunday going through a recovery session. Fletcher will take his first proper session on Tuesday before holding a press conference to preview the trip to Turf Moor.",
      "Although he has no senior management experience, he was part of Erik ten Hag's first-team staff and made 342 appearances for the club as a player. United sources contrasted that level of experience with Chelsea's caretaker boss, Calum McFarlane, who stepped up from academy football in the wake of Enzo Maresca's sacking.",
      "A football finance expert believes Manchester United's decision to hire and then replace Ruben Amorim could cost the club up to £50million. The Reds are on the hunt for their seventh permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, following the sacking of Amorim on Monday.",
      "The 44-year-old succeeded Erik ten Hag in November 2024 - a decision which forced United to pay a compensation bill of £10.4million to the Dutchman and his coaching staff at the time. And doubts over the future of Amorim emerged after Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, with the Portuguese hinting he might depart when his contract expires in 18 months.",
      "Despite his official title being head coach since his appointment by Ineos in November 2024, the former Sporting man insisted on being referred to as the manager at Old Trafford.",
      "Oliver Glasner has emerged as a frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The Portuguese departs Old Trafford after criticising the United hierarchy following his side's draw at Leeds United on Sunday.",
      "But one of the names being linked with replacing Amorim is Glasner, who not only guided Crystal Palace to FA Cup glory last term, but has also already entered the last six months of his contract at Selhurst Park. And when he was asked directly about rumours linking him with United and other 'top clubs' by the Austrian edition of Kicker back in September, Glasner refused to rule out replacing Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United's search for a new coach is back on after Ruben Amorim's dismissal, and former candidate Xavi is one name trending again. The Spaniard has been out of a job since leaving Barcelona in 2024 and has already made his feelings clear on coaching in England.",
      "United announced Amorim was fired on Monday, less than 24 hours after a disappointing 1-1 draw away to Leeds. However, it was his comments after the result, in which he took aim at certain board members for not focusing on their own jobs, that may have sealed his fate.",
      "Xavi, 45, has already worked with United chief executive officer Omar Berrada to some degree, having been a player at the Nou Camp during Berrada's time there before leaving in 2011. The pair could now reunite on English shores, where Xavi has made clear he's be open to a future post.",
      "Taking to Instagram, De Ligt shared a photograph of himself and Amorim, writing: \"Thank you for everything boss, good luck for the future.\"",
      "Glasner is leading the way with the bookmakers.",
      "Betfair - Next permanent United manager",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has sent a heartfelt message to Ruben Amorim after the head coach was sacked by Manchester United. The Reds club captain took to Instagram to share a photograph of the two embracing during a training session.",
      "Harry Maguire has broken his silence on Ruben Amorim's exit from Manchester United. Taking to Instagram after the news emerged that the Portuguese tactician was no longer a part of the set-up at Old Trafford, Maguire shared a photograph of himself and Amorim shaking hands at the side-lines.",
      "As per Manchester World, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is interested in returning to Manchester United in a caretaker role, following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim. The Norwegian has been out of work since he was sacked by Besiktas in August, however, it is unknown as to whether the Reds would bring him back into the fold.",
      "Oliver Glasner is a leading contender to replace Ruben Amorim as Manchester United head coach. The current Crystal Palace boss plays a back three but that isn't expected to count against him when Old Trafford chiefs consider who to appoint next.",
      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, with United sources expressing concern at the lack of progress under the 40-year-old and his failure to implement a more attacking style of play despite nearly 14 months in the job.",
      "Glasner is out of contract at Palace in the summer and could join without compensation then. United could make an approach for the Austrian this month, but given that Glasner threatened to quit in the summer when Marc Guehi was nearly sold to Liverpool, it is unlikely to go down well at Selhurst Park if he agitates to leave now.",
      "Paul Scholes had previously claimed Ruben Amorim failed to grasp the essence of Manchester United - and based on the Portuguese manager's tenure at the club, the former Old Trafford midfielder appears to have been spot on.",
      "Amorim, 40, was dismissed by United fewer than 24 hours after he launched a scathing attack on Gary Neville and other club figures during an \"odd\" press conference that concluded with him walking out. United had ended the previous campaign in 15th position, but Amorim received his dismissal whilst the team sat in sixth place, merely three points adrift of the top four, far from his worst league position.",
      "A lacklustre 1-1 away stalemate against Leeds United turned out to be Amorim's swansong, which seems appropriate considering Scholes' earlier critique of the former United boss. Furthermore, when Amorim's statistics are compared with those of his predecessors, they validate Scholes' observations.",
      "The manner in which Manchester United dismissed Ruben Amorim was markedly different from the sacking of his predecessor, Erik ten Hag.",
      "The 40-year-old manager was let go on Monday morning, less than a day after his final match at the helm - a 1-1 draw against Leeds United on Sunday afternoon. Amorim's departure comes just 14 months into his tenure with the Premier League titans, a decision swiftly executed by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "This rapid dismissal stands in stark contrast to the drawn-out process that led to Ten Hag's eventual exit last October. Three weeks prior to the Dutchman's departure, a gruelling seven-hour meeting took place between Ten Hag and United's top brass at Jim Ratcliffe's Knightsbridge offices in London.",
      "Stam added: \"Ruben Amorim's departure was inevitable, but I was surprised to see him sacked so soon. The performances haven’t been consistent and we were expecting more from him after last season.",
      "\"I was at the Leeds game, and his comments after the match have obviously raised eyebrows in the club’s hierarchy. His system didn’t always suit the players at the club, and we haven’t seen much progress, even though he has had more time between games and fewer competitions.",
      "\"The club must take some of the blame too; they were convinced by a manager who was enjoying a lot of success, but in a completely different league, playing a contrasting style of football. Manchester United are a club associated with attacking, aggressive football, but that was always going to be a challenge, with his system and the players available to him.\"",
      "Jaap Stam, speaking to the Covers.com World Cup betting team, said: “Manchester United need a manager who wants to play attacking football, and Roberto De Zerbi would be my choice to fit that style. I really like De Zerbi as a manager and how he conducts himself in terms of managing the dressing room, his tactics and philosophy.",
      "\"He’s very clear in his approach and he’s tactically very strong; I’d like to see him given the chance at Old Trafford.\""

      "They have been managing European commitments this season, and Glasner has made clear his dissatisfaction with Palace's recruitment. Thursday night fixtures in the Conference League have stretched resources, but although the Eagles have slipped to 14th in the Premier League, they are only four points behind Chelsea in fifth.",
      "United have handed Darren Fletcher interim control of first-team affairs and the former midfielder will take charge of the Premier League trip to Burnley on Wednesday and is likely to remain in the dugout for Sunday's FA Cup third-round tie with Brighton.",

      "That would further strengthen Glasner's credentials. Although Palace would like to keep the 51-year-old, he has shown little appetite for extending his stay at the club.",
      "Before moving to the Premier League, Glasner was a Europa League winner with Eintracht Frankfurt and also had experience in his homeland and with VfL Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Although he has favoured a back three system with Palace and a very similar shape to Amorim, his side have looked more comfortable in their formation than United often have.",
      "Old Trafford figures including Wilcox were less concerned about Amorim's shape than the lack of attacking evolution his team showed during his 63-game stay at the club.",

      "Interim Manchester United manager Darren Fletcher will address the media this afternoon after Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday.",
      "It has been a turbulent couple of days for the Reds which started after the Leeds draw when Amorim essentially urged the board to either back him or sack him. United chose the latter and the following morning he was gone.",
      "Fletcher, who has been the manager of the U18s, will step up to take charge of the side as they travel to relegation-threatened Burnley on Wednesday night. Before then, the Scot will be conducting media duties in what is likely to be a compelling press conference.",
      "There will be plenty of reaction to Amorim's sacking as well as questions around what we can expect to see from his United side. We will also discover whether any players will be fit to return to the squad for this midweek clash. Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes all missed the draw with Leeds through injury.",

      "When Ruben Amorim conducted his first Manchester United press conference in November 2024, he said: \"I truly feel that I am the right man in the right moment. I could be wrong, but the earth will turn and the sun will rise again. It doesn't matter, and I am not worried about that.\"",
      "Amorim was sacked when the sun rose following United's draw against Leeds on Sunday, but he was true to his word from his first conference as he departed, pictured with a care-free look on his face hours after his dismissal.",
      "The 40-year-old has pocketed around £10million and will return to Portugal with his family. Now, the question at Old Trafford is who will be hired to replace Amorim on a permanent basis? Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are already of interest. Glasner has done a magnificent job during his stint at Selhurst Park, and his contract with Crystal Palace is set to expire at the end of the campaign.",
      "Iraola's contract at Bournemouth also expires in the summer, although are either of those coaches cut out for the United job? Glasner plays with five at the back - albeit the tactics within that system are different to Amorim's - while Iraola is hardly the flavour of the month at Bournemouth after a poor run of results.",
      "The bookmakers have priced Glaser, Gareth Southgate, Mauricio Pochettino, Unai Emery, Xavi, Iraola, and Zinedine Zidane as the most likely replacements, but United should consider the former Barcelona midfielder on that list, not the former midfielder who starred for Real Madrid.",
      "Although there is no standout candidate, Xavi makes more appeal than most. The Spaniard has been out of work since leaving Barcelona in 2024 and would be immediately available.",
      "Darren Fletcher will take charge against Burnley and United are considering hiring an interim manager to oversee for the remainder of the season, which could be Fletcher, but Ralf Rangnick's interim stint highlighted the risk of employing a coach who arrives with a short-term remit.",
      "Xavi took his second job in management at Barcelona in 2021, replacing Ronald Koeman, and he led Barcelona to their first La Liga title in four years in his first full season in charge.",
      "The 45-year-old took over at Barcelona during one of the club's most challenging periods due to financial issues, but he turned the team around and won the Spanish Supercopa alongside the league title.",
      "The manner in which Barcelona won their games was impressive. Xavi played with a 4-3-3, which was designed to be an attacking system, something United fans are crying out for after Amorim's tenure.",
      "Xavi reflected on his Barcelona stint and said that \"beyond trophies\", he was proud of trusting a new generation, promoting the likes of Lamine Yamal, Pau Cubarsi and Alejandro Balde.",
      "Several young players promoted by Xavi have had a crucial role in the success of his replacement, Hansi Flick. Xavi is a coach who understands the importance of believing in young players, which is another tick in the box when considering whether he would be a good fit for United.",
      "Xavi would not be fazed by managing at the biggest club in England. Barcelona are even bigger than United around the world, and the Catalan press are some of the harshest critics in global media.",
      "He would command respect in the dressing room as one of the finest midfielders to have ever played the game, and he learned from Pep Guardiola during their time at Barcelona.",
      "Mikel Arteta learned from Guardiola as part of his coaching staff at Manchester City and has significantly improved Arsenal. Enzo Maresca's reputation soared after working with Guardiola. Some clubs have looked for the next best alternative to Guardiola. Xavi might fit that billing for United.",
      "He speaks superb English and spoke warmly about United when in the press conference room at Old Trafford in 2023.",
      "This reporter attended Xavi's press conference that evening and couldn't help but think he could be a future manager of United. The cards have fallen into place to make that a reality.",

      "Amorim was meant to herald a new age under the minority ownership and footballing leadership of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS. They kept the faith through a tremendously testing Premier League season where they finished 15th and fell to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, but it was a power struggle that finally ended his reign.",
      "The next pick is vital, and Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner is the favourite to succeed Amorim. His team have outperformed expectations, winning the FA Cup and improving players like Marc Guehi and Jean-Philippe Mateta into valuable stars.",
      "Enzo Maresca is available after his own failed power struggle at Chelsea, with a Club World Cup and UEFA Conference League trophy under his belt. Gareth Southgate's links remain, and Ipswich's Kieran McKenna and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola have continued to impress.",
      "Xavi Hernandez is also a free agent after leaving Barcelona in 2024, where he won the La Liga title during his first full season in charge.",
      "There's much for fans to consider, but some have reservations about the obvious pick for the job. Reader Dgoett says: \"Glasner is confrontational with his bosses at Palace. Didn't we just see this at Man U? Find a good coach, who gets along with his team and his bosses. Shouldn't be that hard.\"",
      "Commenter Gazsco writes: \"Just booted out a good manager because you didn't like his 343 system, would just about sum up United at the moment if they then appoint Glasner or another manager who plays the same system. Clueless.\"",
      "Khayflux agrees: \"If Manchester United appoints Glasner, then the top brass are confused and have got no idea of what they truly need.",
      "\"You sacked a manager who plays a 343 formation which they and a major section of the fans had complained about, and they still want to hire another manager with the same formation. Any fan who supports Glasner's appointment is as confused as the board.\"",
      "Redpep says: \"Does anyone really think Glasner is the answer. I definitely don’t think so. And so the manager merry go round starts AGAIN!\"",
      "DAVES disagrees: \"Out of a very poor bunch of candidates Glasner is the only one with the correct credentials. Southgate? Do me a favour!\"",
      "Kay Richie is more emphatic: \"Glasner is far better than Amorim, he has trophies and win percentage to show for it in the same league. He plays attacking football with same formation Amorim uses to defend, yet concede more goals always. If you don’t like Glasner just say it, but to compare him to Amorim is a big disrespect to him.\"",
      "Adam80 writes: \"Xavi maybe? De Zerbi? Maresca? All are attacking coaches. Just not Southgate.\"",
      "1968red says: \"Gareth Southgate? Give me a break. Also Maresca hasn't been pulling up the trees at Chelsea. Maybe the Bournemouth manager or Xavi from Barcelona, but not a 343 lover.\"",
      "BayBoy says: \"I would love to see United managed by Xavi. He would in my view set the Prem alight, with his attacking style, tactical brilliance and willingness to give young players their wings. I think he would be the perfect man for the job.\"",
      "Sav7 writes: \"My choices are - Xavi for the Spanish style and discipline, similar to Guardiola and Arteta. Conte as a natural winner, disciplined, 'win at all costs' and fiery. Or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, attacking football the United way with a new refreshed squad.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has appeared to send a thinly-veiled jibe at Ruben Amorim following his sacking. The out-of-favour academy graduate 'liked' a social media post relating to the decision made by the United hierarchy on Monday, which brought the Portuguese's tenure to an end after 14 months.",
      "The 20-year-old has made just 11 appearances in the Premier League this season, out of a possible 20, all of which came from the bench. The midfielder's time out of the starting 11 has been a regular talking point with Amorim during the press conferences as the former Sporting CP boss endured difficulties implementing his style on the squad.",
      "It led to reports surfacing that Mainoo was set to leave Old Trafford, in search of first-team minutes. Following the news on Monday, the midfielder appeared to like a social media post reflecting Amorim's exit.",
      "An Instagram account connected to the player was shown on the list of those who supported a post from page 'thatguysjokes', which posted a carousel of pictures and memes on Amorim's exit.",
      "One of the screenshots featured a tweet that repeated the Mail's claims that Amorim and his coaching staff left the training ground \"laughing and joking\". It was captioned: \"I'd be laughing too after getting a £10mil (sic) payout.\"",
      "Speaking in December, Amorim moved to pour cold water on talk of a potential Mainoo exit as he ruled that the England international was the \"future\" of the club.",
      "He said: \"Kobbie Mainoo will have the opportunity he has all the time.",
      "\"He played in different positions - we talked about the position of Casemiro, he can do that. If you play with a three, he can play like we did in the last game with the position of Mason Mount, he can play there.",
      "\"He is going to be the future of Manchester United, that is my feeling, he just needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days.\"",
      "But the midfielder has recently been in the headlines for the wrong reasons. Mainoo's sister appeared to make it clear that she was pleased with the club's decision to axe the manager.",
      "Last month, his half-brother wore a t-shirt during United's draw with Bournemouth, which read: \"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "Amorim responded: \"It was not Kobbie that wore the t-shirt. He's not going to start because of the t-shirt but he's not going to the bench because of the t-shirt. He's going to play if we feel that he's the right guy to play.",
      "\"That is not an issue. I'm used to it, I'm here for a year, it's not new. So we have to deal with that.",
      "\"But I'm not going to do something to Kobbie because someone in his family is doing something. It's going to be the same. If he's the right guy to play, he's going to play.\"",
      "Mainoo will be hoping to play his way back into the picture with Darren Fletcher taking over the club on an interim basis.",
      "It will be the former Scotland midfielder's first taste of senior management, having served as a first-team coach under Erik ten Hag and a technical director, he had taken up the role as under-18s their lead coach in July 2025.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves hopes Marcus Rashford returns to Old Trafford following Ruben Amorim's departure from the club. The Reds' academy graduate is currently on loan with La Liga giants Barcelona, having spent the second half of last season on loan with Aston Villa after falling out with Amorim.",
      "Rashford, who is under contract at United until the summer of 2028, scored the first goal of Amorim’s tenure back in November 2024, netting three in six games, but soon found himself out of favour.",
      "The Portuguese head coach dropped Rashford in December that year and fired a warning to the star, saying: \"Our team should be so much better with Rashford. But he has to change. If he changes, we are more than welcome to put in a talent like Rashford and we need it.\"",
      "There was no way back for Rashford despite impressing at Villa Park, and he's continued to impress under Hansi Flick at Barcelona.",
      "Rashford has forced his way back into the England set-up, scoring seven goals and notching 11 assists in 25 games for the Spanish side this season.",
      "Hargreaves feels that there was too much emphasis placed on Rashford to be the main player at Old Trafford during his younger years and hopes both he and Kobbie Mainoo can be given another chance under a new head coach after Amorim's sacking.",
      "\"I don’t think Marcus should’ve been in a position where he shouldered all the weight for everything.",
      "\"In our team, he would’ve been the third or fourth guy, so he wouldn’t have to bear all the responsibility because a lot of that would’ve been taken off his shoulders.\"",
      "He added: \"There was too much emphasis on these young guys to be the main man, and they should never have found themselves in that position at just 20 years of age.",
      "\"They needed a striker who was 26-28 years old and then the youngsters could have learned the ropes like everyone did previously at the club.",
      "\"I think Marcus is a super talent and the club could use him. And with Kobbie (Mainoo), I think he’ll be straight back into the team with the side playing a back four.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team for the trip to Burnley and could be joined by Jonny Evans, with United set to approach him over a coaching role.",
      "The club are, however, currently weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, given that this is Fletcher's first experience in management, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",

      "It was in October that Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he wanted to give Ruben Amorim three years to prove he is a \"great coach\". In the end, he didn't even get another three months. The man appointed as Manchester United's first head coach was sacked less than 19 hours after demanding to be the manager instead.",
      "What happened at Leeds looks to have been the final straw but conflict has been building for weeks, if not months. Amorim entered his press conference on Friday with a face like thunder and that stemmed from a meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox earlier that day in which there was a clash between the pair.",
      "United's football structure had expected Amorim to adapt from his 3-4-2-1 system as the players became more settled but officials were starting to sense that the Portuguese head coach was never going to do that. In Friday's meeting, Amorim again reacted angrily when his system was raised.",
      "Amorim then poured fuel on the fire by refusing to answer questions as to why he had recently said he wouldn't get the \"time or money\" to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\".",
      "But United never promised him the cash to rebuild the squad in his image. When Amorim was approached to take over in November last year, it was agreed he would play his system at the start, with the team seen to be lacking a structure under former boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "The end of the Dutchman's reign had been characterised by end-to-end games with no control and the board felt Amorim's set-up could alleviate some of those issues. But it was agreed from the outset that he would adapt once he had his feet under the table.",
      "By Friday evening, club bosses had come to the conclusion he was never going to do so and felt they had no option but to make a change, with some fearing a slide down the table given the level of performances.",
      "It wasn't solely about Amorim moving from a back five to a back four, but more about the lack of an attacking evolution under the 40-year-old. His style of play has been passive and bland, and the draw with Wolves between Christmas and New Year went down particularly badly with the hierarchy at Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters demanded more attacking intent within that game but with the scores level Amorim replaced Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro. It was the kind of negative substitution that came to define his reign.",
      "The club had also been unimpressed with some of Amorim's comments in his media dealings. The criticisms of the academy and namechecking Harry Amass and Chido Obi went down particularly badly, but first-team players weren't immune either.",
      "There was disappointment internally at some veiled criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier in the season, as well as the reference to the anxiety felt when Patrick Dorgu had the ball back in November.",
      "Those issues contributed to the decision to sack Amorim on Monday morning, with Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada delivering the news personally. Although club chiefs have denied talk of a rift, it is clear there was conflict and this was a stunning breakdown in relations that left United's hierarchy with little choice but to axe a man they have all staked their reputations on in one way or another.",
      "Even when Ratcliffe made those comments in October, tensions were beginning to creep into working relationships at Carrington. Faith had ebbed away in Amorim's back three system and some of his emotional outbursts, particularly after games, weren't seen as being helpful.",
      "For Amorim's part, he was starting to show signs of frustration at working in a collaborative structure that didn't give him the power he craved. A £230million summer spending spree focused on players who could fit a back three or a back four, rather than signing specialists for the very particular roles in his system.",
      "If there was tension around transfers, that went both ways. Kobbie Mainoo has become a sticking point between Amorim and the structure around him. United were loath to lose another academy graduate, especially a player seen as one of the best to emerge at the club in recent years.",
      "But Amorim has made it clear he doesn't see Mainoo fitting into his 3-4-2-1 shape. He was tried as a No.10 last season, but the summer spending spree on attackers left him well down the pecking order there. The head coach harboured doubts about Mainoo's defensive work, particularly off the ball, and was reluctant to play him as one of the two deeper midfielders.",
      "This left United in a bind. Mainoo wanted to sign for Napoli on loan on deadline day but there was not enough time to bring in a replacement. United officials were also conscious of the optics of letting him go. But Amorim refused to hand him opportunities and Mainoo hasn't started a single Premier League game this season.",
      "The 20-year-old won't mourn the departure of his head coach and he looks certain to stay at Old Trafford now, rather than seek a temporary departure this month. He might also find chances easier to come by in a three-man midfield, a tactical approach Amorim refused to get on board with.",
      "There were concerns last season that his unique system wasn't translating to the Premier League and was too predictable. Those became sharper internally after the draw with Fulham earlier this season, when director of recruitment Christopher Vivell shared comments from Fulham boss Marco Silva that detailed how easy it was to prepare to face Amorim's United.",
      "When Rob Edwards made similar comments after the draw with Wolves last week, it set alarm bells ringing once again, particularly as that return to a back three came after Amorim had briefly considered a peace accord with Wilcox and co.",
      "His bosses had urged him to be more tactically adaptable and he duly played 4-3-3 against Newcastle on Boxing Day. It was a game from which conclusions were hard to draw, with United looking good in the first half and then hanging on in the second.",
      "Amorim had seen enough, however. He abandoned the flirtation with changing his system and decided if he was going down, it would be on his own sword. He had had enough of the interference from above and stuck to his own principles, with that tactical clash leading to some of the emotion he has shown in recent weeks.",
      "There was also conflict over transfers. United has sought to introduce a more integrated approach to recruitment since the Ineos takeover, but it has left Amorim unable to secure the players he really wanted. There was some tension of the identity of the striker signed in the summer, with United opting to move for Sesko, despite having a similar profile to Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Those signings were players who United felt could play in a number of roles, but Amorim was sticking to his tactical guns rather than adapting as had been agreed.",
      "When he was asked about recruitment recently, he hinted that he and Wilcox didn't always agree but that every club should listen to the manager, because they know the style of play.",
      "Ultimately, Amorim's style of play wasn't winning anyone over at United, and his stubbornness eventually proved too much.",

      "The 44-year-old succeeded Erik ten Hag in November 2024 - a decision which forced United to pay a compensation bill of £10.4million to the Dutchman and his coaching staff at the time.

      "\"No way,\" ex-United defender Ferdinand said on Rio Ferdinand Presents when asked about the possibility of Glasner taking over. \"There's no way, I don't think. I would be so surprised if Glasner gets an opportunity to be Man United manager given that he plays three-at-the-back.",
      "\"Based on how this team has performed and the narrative that has been surrounding the team since Amorim has been here: I would put all my money on it that he doesn't get that job.\"",
      "Amorim had faced pressure for sticking with his three-at-the-back system despite performances and results not improving at the race some were hoping for. Indeed, after using his tried-and-trusted 3-4-2-1 formation for most of last Tuesday's 1-1 draw against rock bottom Wolves, Amorim was scrutinised even more.",
      "Glasner, meanwhile, has enjoyed success with his 3-4-3 shape at Palace. Marc Guehi, Maxence Lacroix and Chris Richards are the three that have typically provided a solid foundation at the back, with Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell giving width as the two wing-backs. Adam Wharton and one of Will Hughes or Jefferson Lerma have been used as the midfield two, followed by a dynamic front three including Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "It's a system that has worked for Glasner, with Palace riding the crest of a wave in their first-ever European campaign and sitting comfortable in mid-table in the Premier League. Although the Eagles have lost four of their last five top-flight matches, they still sit just four points behind fifth-place Chelsea in the table.",
      "As for United, Darren Fletcher is set to take charge on an interim basis for Wednesday's trip to Burnley. They will be looking to return to winning ways after back-to-back draws against Wolves and Leeds United.",

      "Dan Ashworth would have known the end was coming at Manchester United when he was marched through the press conference room soon after the defeat to Nottingham Forest in December 2024. This was a public sacking for a figure who had gone from hero to zero in five months in the eyes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ashworth was the man Ratcliffe called \"one of the best sporting directors in the world\" during protracted negotiations with Newcastle to lure him to Old Trafford. However, within months, relations had soured. It reflected poorly on Ratcliffe at the time and now, with the dismissal of Ruben Amorim, the manager over whom Ashworth had so many reservations, even worse.",
      "Ratcliffe could have picked up the phone to anyone in the game and been told Ashworth was a structures guy, not the kind of sporting director who would hand over a list of the five most highly rated 30-something coaches in Europe. He was a sensible appointment for a club that needed reshaping. But his caution over the appointment of Amorim ultimately did for him.",
      "Ashworth could see the problems coming of parachuting in a head coach mid-season who had a distinctive playing style. This wasn't a squad built for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and neither did United have the cash to transform it.",
      "It was a sensible, pragmatic, common-sense approach, but didn't fit with the bravado and excitement of everyone else involved. Amorim was the shiny new toy, the up-and-coming coach who had built an excellent reputation at Sporting and when he guided his old club to a 4-1 win against Manchester City in November 2024, Old Trafford had fallen head over heels.",
      "In hindsight, now that the Portuguese has been unceremoniously sent packing after just 14 months at the helm, the concerns Ashworth highlighted were correct. Amorim might still be an excellent coach (or manager), and with the right players, his system might be a success somewhere. But these weren't conditions he was ever likely to encounter at United and it's been proven.",
      "Instead, he played his system without the tools to do and his team became too predictable as a result. Most of the best managers in the game have a fairly distinctive style of play, but it is often unstoppable because they have the players to execute it. Not at Old Trafford. Not for Amorim.",
      "When his bosses were telling him to change the system and that there was no money, it was hard to see how he would ever survive and create a successful team. That chance is now gone.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada are damaged by the episode, their reputations at the club linked to Amorim's appointment. This was their big call and it has gone horribly wrong.",
      "It will take some explaining away when there was at least one senior figure in the building sounding the alarm bells. They ignored that warning and pressed ahead anyway. The surprise is the nature of the unravelling. less than 14 months on, not that it happened.",
      "So now, does Ratcliffe trust Wilcox and Berrada to get the next appointment right? Ratcliffe himself has hitched himself to the success of a head coach he likes.",
      "The 73-year-old was desperate for his first appointment to be the right one, but that has not happened. Now, the past 14 months feel like a waste. United are no further on than when Erik ten Hag was sacked - and the Dutchman won trophies, in fairness to him.",
      "Ashworth might have advocated an appointment considered safer, maybe even a little more boring. He would have been panned for pushing Gareth Southgate's credentials and Thomas Frank has struggled with the step up from Brentford to Tottenham. But in pointing out the pitfalls of going for Amorim, he could see what was likely to happen.",

      "The England international fell out of favour with the Portuguese head coach last season - and joined Aston Villa in search of first-team minutes. A permanent move to Villa Park didn't come to fruition and Rashford saw his return to the club delayed as he looked for regular football - which resulted in a move to the Camp Nou.",

      "Rashford made just six appearances under Amorim - scoring two goals - as he was a high-profile exclusion on a number of occasions during the early days of the former Sporting CP head coach's reign.",
      "The bold call was made to drop the 28-year-old for a Manchester derby against Manchester City before Amad's heroics inspired a turnaround win over Pep Guardiola's side.",

      "\"From the moment I arrived I felt that everyone welcomed me very well. For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies.",
      "\"Last season was fantastic, but in life everything happens very quickly, things change and the goal is to repeat the successes. I'm totally focused on this. With the staff and the teammates everything is fantastic, I can't complain.",

      "He added: \"There is pressure here, but it's not a negative pressure. It's the one you want as a player, the one I want and have always wanted as a footballer.",
      "\"I can't be in a place where important objectives aren't demanded of you. For me, it's more difficult to be motivated and give my best at a club where the demand is not maximum.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is among those being touted for a move to Manchester United following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim by Old Trafford bosses. Earlier this season, the Austrian's remarks suggested that United had made progress under the Portuguese coach's leadership, but his departure tells a different story.",
      "United had a dismal 2025, ending the season in 15th place with a mere 42 points in the Premier League and only nine victories - their worst performance in the competition's history. This season they've amassed 31 points from 20 matches and sit in sixth place.",
      "While there has been an improvement in terms of points gained, the team's performances have been lacklustre as they struggled to adapt to Amorim's 3-4-3 formation. A draw against relegation-threatened Wolves and a point at Elland Road last weekend led to a fiery post-match press conference from Amorim, where he criticised the club's management and former player Gary Neville.",
      "United issued a statement confirming Amorim's sacking, emphasising their ambition to finish the season as high up the table as possible.",
      "Glasner, who recently led the Eagles to FA Cup and Community Shield victories, is one of the names linked with the now vacant managerial role at United, and his tactical approach aligns closely with that of the now-departed Amorim.",
      "Speaking earlier this season about United's approach under the Portuguese manager, Glasner defended Amorim by highlighting the team's statistical performance.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said back in November.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and invested £200m - buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, that's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now.",
      "\"I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Glasner could represent an immediate solution to replace Amorim, whilst his own situation at Selhurst Park remains uncertain with his contract due to run out this summer. The Austrian is yet to sign fresh terms with the Eagles and might prove to be the solution to United's difficulties.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner said earlier this season when explaining the benefits of lining up in a 3-4-3.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",

      "After sacking Ruben Amorim, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a big decision to make.",
      "Manchester United have shown flashes of promise this season, but a run of disappointing results - coupled with a breakdown in relations between manager and ownership - led to the axe falling on the Portuguese coach after just 14 months in charge.",
      "Attention now turns to Amorim's successor. While the Red Devils will have no shortage of candidates, one manager Ratcliffe has previously admitted admiring may prove far harder to persuade.",
      "That man is Jurgen Klopp, who famously led Liverpool to both Premier League and Champions League glory. Ratcliffe has waxed lyrical about the German in the past, suggesting that Klopp could well be a dream target of his.",
      "\"Klopp has this ability to drive his players to a frenzy,\" he said back in March 2024, shortly after taking over footballing operations at Old Trafford. \"Total commitment on the pitch. And, you know, that's one of the things a good coach can do.\"",
      "Klopp is currently Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull, having joined the company shortly after leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023/24 season.",
      "He has previously insisted that his time at Liverpool would be his last in management. Combined with the fierce rivalry between the two clubs, a move to Old Trafford appears supremely unlikely.",
      "Instead, the Red Devils will have to turn their attention to other, more realistic targets. Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner is thought to be among the favourites for the role, along with former England head coach Gareth Southgate - another man long admired by Ratcliffe.",
      "Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Aston Villa's Unai Emery and former United defender Laurent Blanc are also being linked. For now, however, U-18s coach Darren Fletcher will take charge on an interim basis until a permanent successor is named.",
      "In a statement on Monday morning, United confirmed Amorim's departure. \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United,\" the statement read.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Amorim's departure comes in the wake of United's 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday. Speaking after the game, the 40-year-old hinted at tensions behind the scenes, insisting he considered himself \"manager\" of United, rather than simply \"coach\".",
      "\"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change,\" Amorim said. \"That was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has irked one BBC journalist by not letting him watch him work, while a ‘peculiar’ training tactic is revealed.",
      "Plus, who could be the Telegraph’s source?",
      "",
      "There’s a plethora of ‘inside stories’ of Ruben Amorim’s sacking by Manchester United, but Mediawatch is absolutely here for the columns from those journalists who can barely see beyond the end of their own noses, which are so easily put out of joint by restricted access.",
      "Here’s Simon Stone of the BBC:",
      "Amorim had a few quirks, but most coaches do.",
      "When United opened their doors for the first 15 minutes of training the day before European games, it was strange to see Amorim watch the sprints and rondos on a different pitch – sometimes 50 yards away, and far removed from his coaching staff.",
      "He was far more involved – whistle in hand – when the sessions began, though he wasn’t keen to let the media into those.",
      "And that’s a ‘quirk’? That he did not take part in the circus of the 15-minute open training sessions that are specifically designed to reveal absolutely nothing to the watching media? And then he ‘wasn’t keen’ to allow the media to watch actual training? Weirdo.",
      "There was a full open session in Malaysia on United’s post-season trip in May, but that whole expedition was not run on fully professional lines given the amount of downtime that was allowed.",
      "Once United arrived at their training base in Chicago in July, access was limited. The candour of Amorim’s media conferences was not matched by his openness with training.",
      "This is just plain odd. You cannot find fault with the quotes given by an eminently quotable and open man, so you criticise him for not letting you watch him work?! Does Stone like to write with somebody watching over his shoulder? Can we volunteer?",
      "He was meticulous in his preparation, though.",
      "Footage of his first training session at United showed him explaining to midfielder Kobbie Mainoo exactly how many strides he needed to move after laying off a pass, then where to open out his body to create maximum passing angles.",
      "In the summer, he had two players taking up the same positions in training, then ran through different scenarios to ensure they moved into the right area of the pitch.",
      "While this may seem peculiar – and would have looked so had anyone witnessed it – it does make sense given individuals were allocated positions and a hierarchy installed.",
      "Genuinely intrigued about how it is ‘peculiar’ to train footballers who play in the same position to move into the right areas of the pitch. Did Stone think that footballers just played five-a-side all day?",
      "It’s probably wise that Amorim didn’t let him watch actual training; it would have blown his bleeding mind.",
      "",
      "It’s an absolute mystery who briefed the Daily Telegraph about Ruben Amorim ‘blowing up’ in a meeting with Jason Wilcox in which the Portuguese is said to have ‘lost it’. Clue: It wasn’t Amorim.",
      "There are a few clues…",
      "Given that things had been coming to a boil over a number of weeks, one source suggested Wilcox probably sensed Amorim was ready to explode when they met on Friday morning. “I think he saw it coming a mile off,” the insider said.",
      "Who could it possibly be who knew the inner workings of the Wilcox mind?",
      "But Amorim’s barbs still jarred with some who had watched Wilcox offer every level of support and make himself available 24/7 to the manager. “When Ruben’s head was falling off, Wilcox was always the calm presence beside him, always there to offer support,” one source said.",
      "Was he also handsome and a very selfless but powerful lover?",
      "Another insider added: “Jason was a counsellor for him at times. Anything he needed he was there for him at any hour of the day. They were in constant contact. He couldn’t have given him a bigger or better platform to succeed in terms of the support he gave him.”",
      "And he was also one hell of a sexy mo-fo.",

      "Those NINE team-mates (one headline still says TEN; how low will it have to go before they abandon the capitals?) who have ‘stayed silent’ on social media for a whole 24 hours include ‘goalkeepers Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton, Noussair Mazraoui and Tyrell Malacia’.",

      "The demise of Ruben Amorim at Man Utd involves Jason Wilcox, Emi Martinez and an interview so damaging to one player ‘the broadcaster agreed’ to remove it.",
      "Amorim was finally sacked after 14 months, 63 games, hundreds of millions of pounds spent and, ultimately, a tense chat with Man Utd shot-caller Wilcox, who might well have aimed a Jose Mourinho-shaped dig.",
      "With help from a great many journalists with contacts in and around Old Trafford, here are the best bits of the inside stories of Amorim’s Man Utd sacking.",
      "",
      "The meeting between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox seems destined to go down in Man Utd infamy.",
      "Amorim is described by the various reports on his demise to have been ‘overly emotional’, ‘very negative’, ‘erratic’ and even ‘incensed’ at having his tactical approach questioned in the aftermath of the Wolves home draw, which appears to have been far more damaging than the stalemate at Leeds five days later.",
      "The changes in shape which delivered a thrilling attacking performance against Bournemouth and clear improvements in the win over Newcastle were cast aside when perhaps the worst team in Premier League history came to Old Trafford, and Amorim greeted Wolves with his patented three-at-the-back formation.",
      "The result was an insipid performance and humiliating draw which underlined the disconnect between club and coach. Rob Dawson of ESPN writes that it underlined ‘a growing feeling within the club that Amorim and his staff had come to fear the Premier League’.",
      "It led to confusion in the Man Utd hierarchy, which felt that Amorim needed to show more flexibility and a willingness to adapt.",
      "Having already grown frustrated with ‘the unwanted influence of Wilcox,’ according to Simon Stone of the BBC, Amorim ‘blew up’, to phrase a couple of reports, at the perceived criticism.",
      "Two accounts of the meeting do seem especially ghost-written by a Jason W. No, that’s too obvious. Let’s say J. Wilcox.",
      "Dawson says the director of football had simply ‘encouraged’ Amorim ‘to be more proactive’ and ‘delivered the message in a calm and measured way’.",
      "Richard Jolly of the Independent writes that Wilcox was ‘not just expressing his own thoughts but those of others in the structure,’ and that ‘what Amorim probably did not realise, however, was that Wilcox was the last defending him, the last arguing he should be granted more time’ and ‘could not have done more for him’.",
      "The final call to sack Amorim was made by Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada with the full support of the rest of the Manchester United decision-making structure. The line is that the coach’s failure to carry out his promise to develop and evolve the team away from his own preferred philosophy after over a year in charge was ultimately his undoing, rather than any breakdown in relationships with higher-ups.",
      "MORE ON THE INFLUENCE OF JASON WILCOX AT MANCHESTER UNITED\n* Ta-ra, Amorim. Now for Man Utd’s inept board to hire their next underling\n* Jason Wilcox is absurdly one of English football’s most powerful figures, in accordance with the prophecy",
      "",
      "Amorim, who had to be talked out of resigning during his first months in the role, is alleged to have flirted with a similar decision during the talk with Wilcox.",
      "In a wide-ranging Athletic article, Laurie Whitwell, Adam Crafton and Mark Critchley write that when Wilcox told Amorim the players ‘had become confused over his vision’, the coach simply ‘responded that the players needed to be changed’.",
      "Wilcox’s reply was diplomatic, hoping to ‘work through the issues’, but Amorim ‘reacted by saying he wished to leave the club and would be calling his agent’.",
      "He had his wish a few days later.",
      "The Telegraph says ‘those inside the club’ believed Amorim ‘wanted to go and was determined to engineer an exit,’ with one source quoted as saying: “This is a manager who basically decided to blow it all up. He’s been looking for the opportunity. He wanted out.”",
      "Richard Keys absolutely nailed it.",
      "Wilcox told the players in a meeting held after Amorim’s sacking that “we don’t understand where the last 48 hours have come from,” and how he had also “sensed some situations where they were not on the same wavelength as Amorim”.",
      "It is not known what Harry Maguire decided to emphatically head clear in response.",
      "",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles, the criticism, everything, we need to change the club,” Amorim said in his final public comments as Man Utd head coach.",
      "It seemed like a strange comment at the time, out of place in an already notably abrasive missive. Yet as with much of what Amorim said, it was heavily influenced by his feelings behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim had grown to feel ‘the pressure to change his system’ from Wilcox and those above him was building because of ‘continued criticism from former players in the media, including Gary Neville and Paul Scholes,’ according to ESPN’s Dawson.",
      "The three Athletic writers suggest Amorim’s comment might have been ‘a reference to the possibility that Ratcliffe watches Neville’s podcast, in which he has questioned Amorim’s tactics’.",
      "But Jamie Jackson of The Guardian says nothing will change, even with Amorim’s frustration at the set-up: ‘Whoever does take over will have to work within the structure that gives Wilcox and Berrada a higher status regarding football policy than the head coach.’",
      "Neville has, of course, since had his say.",
      "",
      "No-one should be willing to lose their job over Emiliano Martinez but there might never have been a man more willing to die on unnecessarily awkward hills than Amorim.",
      "While far from the biggest issue causing his ultimate downfall, transfers certainly contributed. Some situations are specifically cited, such as Amorim’s treatment of the bomb squad and how Alejandro Garnacho’s value was deemed to have been reduced by £15m as a direct result of how he was ostracised around the time of the Europa League final.",
      "Another bone of contention was how Amorim had a £72m striker in Benjamin Sesko foist upon him despite his desire for a proven Premier League commodity in Ollie Watkins.",
      "But the decision to sign Senne Lammens over Martinez was the bigger sticking point.",
      "That was where the Man Utd hierarchy ‘drew a line’ and ‘refused to sanction’ the transfer (Stone, BBC), which would have cost far more in a fee and wages for a much older player.",
      "But it was that experience and personality in particular which Amorim felt his squad lacked.",
      "It is said by ESPN’s Dawson that Amorim’s praise of Matheus Cunha in October – “we need leaders, but sometimes what I am thinking is we need some crazy guys” – was actually ‘viewed internally as a dig at the board for passing on Martinez’.",
      "Things came to a head in January when Amorim pushed for Antoine Semenyo, a summer target with a £65m release clause which is active through the start of the winter window.",
      "While the Bournemouth forward was disappointed with elements of Manchester United’s approach in the summer, when they eventually favoured a move for Bryan Mbeumo instead, Semenyo was willing to talk with Amorim again and did so over the phone.",
      "It was then when Semenyo sought assurances over his role but also the future composition of the team itself, having been ‘concerned’ he would be used at wing-back.",
      "Paul Hirst of The Times details how Amorim told Semenyo ‘he was a flexible manager’ during that call, and that he would be moving away from any variation of his favoured 3-4-3 formation soon.",
      "James Ducker and Sam Wallace of the Daily Telegraph corroborate that, saying Amorim told Semenyo he would be used ‘as a left-winger in a dynamic 4-3-3’. Yet days later Man Utd had reverted to type in that Wolves game, perhaps signalling to Amorim’s employers that his show of tactical flexibility and evolution was neither lasting nor worth investing more money in.",
      "",
      "As one Telegraph source said: “You can write down 100 things he said in press conferences where you’re thinking, ‘F**king hell Ruben, what are you doing? Why are you saying that?”",
      "Amorim himself appears to have accepted how many of his painfully honest public comments worked against him in the end, including his decision to question the development of three academy graduates the club had loaned out, later questioning “the feeling of entitlement” he felt had become a problem “for the kids” at the club.",
      "Those quotes and his personal barbs even at senior players, like Benjamin Sesko or the “anxiety”-ridden Patrick Dorgu, went down abysmally, much like his handling of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "In Amorim’s defence, Dawson says the Portuguese continued with his approach ‘in the hope it would elicit a positive response’ from a group he deemed “broken”, “fragile” and in need of some home truths.",
      "But there were moments he clearly crossed the line, Roy Keane MUTV rant-style, as Dawson documents:",
      "‘In another television interview last season, Amorim was so outspoken about a player that the club felt it was better to ask the broadcaster to remove the comments before they were aired. The broadcaster agreed.’",
      "It all spawned one of the great manager nicknames, delivered by ‘one player representative’ according to Hirst of The Times after Amorim declared them “the worst team in the history of Manchester United”.",
      "Farewell, “Ruben Interim”. You will be missed.",
      "Ruben Amorim has irked one BBC journalist by not letting him watch him work, while a ‘peculiar’ training tactic is revealed.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",

      "On Monday, news channels across the globe led with the ongoing story of FIFA Peace Prize winner Donald Trump’s operation to kidnap the leader of a sovereign country and put him on trial. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim was being sacked as Manchester United manager.",
      "Even almost 13 years since their last league title, United remain the biggest club in the country, up there with the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in terms of global attention. Add up the column inches, TV segments and YouTube videos this past decade and the club demanding more attention than anyone else is Manchester United.",
      "They are the sun in which a lot of English football orbits, which is why it can be so hard to get a decision right.",
      "This is not a defence of the Glazers or Ratcliffe for hiring a manager head coach wedded to a back three and then being shocked he does not deviate from it; that is a stupid decision regardless of which club you are running. But any time so much as a tap at an Old Trafford toilet gets changed, a familiar pattern occurs.",
      "And just recently, former midfielders Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt launched their own podcast alongside United-supporting TV host Paddy McGuinness.",
      "And that podcast is where Butt made one of the more ludicrous suggestions as to who should be in the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "“Darren [Fletcher] with either Michael [Carrick] and [Steve] Bruce, and if Michael wouldn’t do it, then Darren and Bruce until the end of the season.",
      "“Bruce has got unbelievable experience. Unbelievable. He is a great bloke, really. He knows the club.",
      "“He’s got no aspirations of going back into football for [himself] so he’s not gonna go, ‘I’m in charge here, it’s my club’… He’s gonna help.”",
      "Surely that last sentence alone is enough for Bruce to be ruled out? But if we put that to one side and say the 65-year-old can be tempted with the job he always wanted, what on earth qualifies him for it?",
      "Bruce’s last gig was with League One Blackpool, where he picked up 1.39 points per game, a tally only slightly better than his last Premier League job at Newcastle, where he registered 1.15 points per game. Perhaps the only thing that qualifies him for the job is he knows how to get United winning – he has managed against them 27 times and lost 21 times.",
      "MORE ON THE AMORIM DEPARTURE ON F365",
      "* Neville names Tuchel as one of three potential Man Utd managers he ‘likes’\n* Amorim issued ‘sack’ ultimatum to INEOS as Man Utd to make January signing on one condition\n* ‘Only way’ Man Utd appoint Thomas Tuchel as Amorim replacement revealed",
      "That Newcastle stint ended in 2021 and as scary as it may all be for us to accept the movement of time, that was five years ago.",
      "Butt’s claim is that Bruce ‘knows the club’, but which club does he know? Bruce played for United from 1987 to 1996. Only five of United’s players were even born then.",
      "Butt is not alone in his suggestion. Ferdinand wanted, nay expected, himself to be Fletcher’s second call behind 13-time Premier League winner Ferguson. Keane has been suggested as someone who can get the good ship United sailing in the right direction once again.",
      "The mad ideas are not unique to United but the sheer number of them is. Enzo Maresca, a manager who achieved more than Amorim and whose club is above United, also left his job and yet someone like Hernan Crespo was not telling the Chelsea board to get Michael Ballack in because he ‘knows the club’. The closest example was the inevitable linking of Frank Lampard to the job, but that suggestion at least comes with the caveat that he is currently managing the side at the top of the Championship.",
      "With United, there is a burning desire to return to the glory years of the club. Perhaps it is the cold turkey approach of going from consistent title challengers to struggling to make the top four that has left such a yearning. The pundits we see on our screens, hear on podcasts and read in articles are from the ‘90s and ‘00s because frankly, who is there from more recently?",
      "When a TV company is deciding which pundit has more credibility and will attract more viewers, title winners are going to have more sway than a player who was at United when they finished sixth in 2019. It’s also why Paul Merson, Lee Dixon, Ian Wright and Thierry Henry are the only Arsenal pundits you ever seem to see.",
      "The problem is that it creates an unrealistic standard that will never be reached and an environment where every decision is analysed under the microscope. Go and look at pictures of Amorim when he first arrived compared to when he left and it’s a similar vibe to Barack Obama’s first day as President compared to his last.",
      "The Portuguese boss was astonished in his very first week just how many interviews he had to do but that is because everyone wants a slice of the Manchester United pie. It is a club always in the news even as the 15th-best team in the league last year.",
      "The comparison of Ferguson and his long wait for a trophy is not a new one but is worth keeping in mind. Could the Scotsman have survived if every day there was a former player questioning his position? When Ferguson dropped David Beckham, could he have dealt with the resulting backlash in a social media world? Back then, Ferguson simply had to avoid reading the newspapers and go about his day.",
      "Football has changed so much in the 13 years since Ferguson walked away and harking back to that United is pining after something that is just not possible anymore.",
      "Ratcliffe and INEOS have made some questionable and at times just morally wrong decisions since taking over football operations but when every decision they make feels like the biggest decision in the world, no wonder they make some errors.",
      "Fletcher, Xavi, Zidane, whoever’s next, it won’t change. Manchester United sells more than any other club in the world and while that remains the case, expect to continue to see anyone who ever even looked at a red shirt tell the club who they should be appointing and why that will finally bring them back to the good old days.",
      "Even Steve Bruce.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",

      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a clean sheet against Sunderland earned with one especially fine save from Omar Alderete’s header. A less impressive clean sheet came against Burnley.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest and Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Spurs and Vicario have at least tightened up since then.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 13 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and basically had nothing to do v Palace.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so.",

      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a penalty save at Wolves – even if he conceded it – sees the Irishman climb towards respectability.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save v Fulham.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",

      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in. Though he’s hardly convincing…",
      "",

But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save v Liverpool.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Since then, performing roughly as expected, even if many remain unconvinced.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save.",

      "There were a number of reasons for his dismissal with journalist Ben Jacobs revealing that there was ‘tension over a lack of alignment in the market and a breakdown between Amorim and Jason Wilcox.’",
      "Man Utd believed that ‘there haven’t been enough signs of evolution or progress’ and Jacobs added that the club insisted no head coach will ‘be given a recruitment veto like Erik ten Hag, as Manchester United’s model is collaborative’.",
      "There have already been a number of managers linked with the vacant Man Utd job with Darren Fletcher taking over for one or two games while the Red Devils attempt to appoint an interim boss until the end of the season.",

      "However, Butt has urged Man Utd not to appoint Maresca, who was sacked by Chelsea last month, as he would be another ex-Man City person joining the club.",
      "Butt said: “If Maresca comes in – I like him as a coach, I really do – with the background, I would give my season tickets back.”",
      "But Man Utd legend Scholes replied: “I think going to Chelsea he would last two minutes. He has done alright.”",
      "Explaining himself, Butt added: “You mis-read me. I can’t sit here and go on about Man united philosophy and DNA and then go, ‘Well I’d love Maresca, an ex-Man City guy.’ Then you have Omar Berrarda and Jason Wilcox.",
      "“I don’t care how much success is. You’re forgetting where I’m from. Everyone is a City fan. I’m a Man United fan and I can’t accept that.”",

      "One club and their transfer curse cannot be beaten for January incompetence. It is the only which saves that doomed swap between Arsenal and Man United.",
      "For something a little cheerier, do consider every current Premier League club’s greatest January signing ever. These do not feature.",
      "",
      "Samba would be a lot higher on this list had QPR not somehow managed to persuade Anzhi Makhachkala to pay £12m to re-sign the central defender six months after they had themselves somehow persuaded QPR to pay £12.5m for him.",
      "It’s funny how both of those clubs ended up a financial clusterf***, isn’t it? A real puzzle.",
      "The QPR manager at the time was, of course, Harry Redknapp. Having only weeks earlier explained how “you shouldn’t be paying massive wages when you’ve got a stadium that holds 18,000 people,” a pay packet of £100,000 a week was sanctioned for Samba, who the boss called “a monster” and “proper centre-half” who would shore the club’s defence up and move them away from relegation trouble.",
      "Samba played 10 matches in which QPR conceded 19 times, failed to keep a clean sheet after his debut and told supporters to “get over” how much he was paid after conceding a penalty and being at fault for another goal in a 3-2 defeat to Fulham.",
      "QPR were relegated soon after and the Arsenal transfer legend was on his way.",
      "",
      "The Premier League did not see the best of Mitroglou. The Premier League did not see much of Mitroglou at all. A player previously known as ‘Mitrogoals’ for his scoring record would have been better rechristened with team-mate Steve Sidwell’s fond nickname: “This f***er.”",
      "Having scored 41 times in 92 league games for an Olympiacos side which walked the Greek league, Fulham spent £13m – a club record fee at the time – to bring Mitroglou to England and save them from relegation.",
      "He would start one league game between his arrival and Fulham’s relegation in May, playing 151 minutes in total.",
      "By August, Mitroglou had gone back on loan to Olympiacos and the next month scored the winner against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. The following night, Fulham lost 5-3 away at Nottingham Forest to a Britt Assombalonga hat-trick to leave them bottom of the Championship.",
      "",
      "No list of shonky transfer decision-making is complete without some pre-Emery Aston Villa. They form the January transfer idiocy trifecta with QPR and West Ham.",
      "Makoun arrived from Lyon as a highly-rated midfielder. He was aged 27 and had played 36 times in the Champions League in the previous six seasons. He had started victories over Real Madrid, Liverpool, Manchester United and Milan in the competition.",
      "“He is an experienced player. He is a proper link between the midfield and the strikers,” manager Gerard Houllier said. “He has played in the Champions League. He’ll be a good asset for the future.”",
      "Makoun looked sloppy on his debut, got a straight red card for a dreadful tackle a fortnight later and played only five times in the league before the end of the season. He never played for Villa again, and yet only left on a permanent deal in July 2013.",
      "",
      "Ah Afonso, the striker now doomed forever to be held up as the example of why you should beware when buying strikers from the Eredivisie.",
      "As with Samba, the Brazilian would have threatened the top three but for a significant and inexplicable recouping of transfer outlay. In this instance, Middlesbrough somehow persuaded Qatar’s Al-Sadd to part with £7m for him.",
      "But that does not spare enough of the embarrassment Boro are still made to feel almost 20 years on every time someone throws money at PSV or Ajax or Feyenoord for a striker.",
      "His 13 goals in 49 games included a hat-trick in that absurd 8-1 win over Manchester City, a penalty, and an FA Cup brace at home to Barrow. Boro were relegated – and Alves left – at the end of his only full season at the Riverside, with the Brazilian perhaps forever destined to be seen as the worst signing in the club’s history.",
      "",
      "While only one of these qualifies as the worst January signing in their club’s history, the fact both are so inextricably and inexplicably tied makes it easier for them to land a spot in the top ten.",
      "Torres, having already endured a general loss of form linked to an increasing list of physical issues built up over a career of playing ludicrously often since he was a teenager, was nevertheless identified by Chelsea as “one of the best players in the world with his peak years ahead of him” when they made what was then the fourth-biggest transfer in world football.",
      "For £50m they might well have expected 20 goals for the rest of the 2010/11 season. They received as many in the Premier League, but across his entire 172-game career for the Blues instead.",
      "His effect on Gary Neville and direct contribution to the three trophies he won at Stamford Bridge aside, it was a stunning failure Liverpool felt compelled to match.",
      "The majority of their £50m windfall was redirected to Newcastle for a player with 14 goals in 37 top-flight career games, who hoped to “fail” his medical.",
      "That he likely would have at any other point during an 18-month Liverpool career in which he scored 11 goals in 58 games will not be lost on the Anfield faithful. The Reds took a £20m hit when selling Carroll; to be fair, Torres left Chelsea as a 30-year-old free agent who by that point was still the most expensive player ever transferred between two Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "The West Ham striker curse continues to strike over a decade and a half later, but McCarthy was among the first proper victims upon his move from Blackburn in 2010.",
      "The Golden Boot runner-up to Didier Drogba only a couple of seasons prior, McCarthy had also cracked double figures for goals in 2008/09. But after falling out of favour with a series of managers he sought solace at Upton Park, joining on the same day as Mido and Ilan.",
      "The South Africa legend did not score in his 14 appearances for West Ham before having his contract terminated by mutual consent in April 2011, a month before they slid into the Championship.",
      "",
      "There was little logic apparent in Southampton chucking a club-record £19.2m Monaco’s way for their fourth-choice forward in January 2018, beyond the forlorn hope that some residual Kylian Mbappe had rubbed off on Carrillo.",
      "It had not. Signed as a show of faith in manager Mauricio Pellegrino, Carrillo played eight times under the manager before his mid-March sacking. Replacement Mark Hughes curiously did not have quite the same level of belief in the Argentinean striker, who only played twice more in his first half-season.",
      "Nothing had changed by the summer and so Carrillo was loaned out to Leganes – the club Pellegrino took over after leaving the south coast. That loan was renewed a year later and by complete coincidence they were relegated from La Liga in 2020.",
      "Carrillo played his first game for Southampton on January 27, 2018 and his last on March 31 of the same year, failing to score and only eventually leaving permanently, on a free, two-and-a-half years later.",
      "",
      "It’s a pretty spectacular example of Newcastle-style long-term planning. In the summer of 2004, Boumsong was available on a free transfer and eventually joined Rangers. Four months later, Newcastle paid £8m to sign a central defender that nobody else was in for and who Newcastle themselves had shown no interest in signing on a free.",
      "Even if Boumsong had been decent, it would have been a cock-up.",
      "He wasn’t. In fact, the transfer was one of the deals raised by the Stevens Inquiry as being potentially suspect, with inconsistencies between the evidence given by manager Graeme Souness and Freddy Shepherd. The inquiry eventually decided that neither party, nor risible football agent Willie McKay, had a case to answer. Always a result when you manage to evade awkward questions because people are perfectly willing to accept you are just that incompetent.",
      "",
      "Swap deals and part-exchanges used to be all the rage in transfer gossip columns and speculatory circles but such spurious stories don’t tend to see the light of day anymore. A genuine theory: it’s because Alexis Sanchez and Henrikh Mkhitaryan ruined them for everyone by accidentally actually happening and highlighting why they never really actually had much before.",
      "It is difficult to quantify the sheer dreadfulness endured by literally every party involved in the transfer. Neither player enjoyed themselves in new surroundings. Neither club benefited. Both of the managers who sanctioned the deal were gone by the end of the year, Jose Mourinho pushed by Manchester United whereas Arsene Wenger jumped from Arsenal. The fans had almost nothing to celebrate beyond Sanchez’s piano-playing announcement video and Mkhitaryan’s assist-laden debut.",
      "Manchester United ran up an absurd wage bill for five goals in 45 games before discovering no-one fancied helping them shift that burden. Arsenal at least avoided that ignominy – Mkhitaryan was roughly OK and earned far less. But both players eventually left on free transfers for a reason, so cursed was this swap.",
      "",
      "Just a very sad story. Having sold Craig Bellamy to Manchester City for £14m, West Ham reinvested most of the proceeds in Savio, a German striker from Serie B side Brescia. Nsereko had scored three career league goals, all in the second tier.",
      "Savio played ten league games for West Ham but only ever started one match and never scored. Not only was his shooting awry, his physical presence was that of a dormouse. West Ham sold him to Fiorentina for just £3m less than seven months after signing him, taking a £1m loss per month on the initial outlay.",
      "From then on, Savio declined rapidly. He moved through lower-league clubs in Germany and Italy before moving through Kazakhstan, Bulgaria and Lithuania. There was also an arrest for faking his own kidnapping in Thailand, and reports of mental health issues along the way.",
      "“I made a lot of mistakes. In fact, I did everything wrong that I could,” he told Bild in 2013, retiring seven years later having long faded from view.",

      "There have been noises that the England international would like to stay on at Barcelona past the end of the season with the La Liga side having an option to make the deal permanent in the summer.",
      "However, Spanish publication Sport insists that triggering his €40m clause is ‘something the Camp Nou club is not considering’ and it is ‘highly likely that United will try to recall him’ after Amorim was sacked on Monday.",
      "The report adds that Barcelona had ‘hoped to renegotiate the fee’ down in the summer but that ‘Amorim’s dismissal could toughen conditions, as Manchester United might be keen to bring back their prodigal son to lead their new project’.",

      "“There was too much emphasis on these young guys to be the main man, and they should never have found themselves in that position at just 20 years of age.",
      "“They needed a striker who was 26-28 years old and then the youngsters could have learned the ropes like everyone did previously at the club.",
      "“I think Marcus is a super talent and the club could use him.”",
      "Amorim, who was appointed in November 2024, never really showed clear progress at Man Utd and disagreeements with Jason Wilcox and the board ultimately cost him his job.",
      "Reacting to the news, former Man Utd midfielder Hargreaves added: “I was surprised, and I think everybody was surprised by the decision to sack Amorim.",
      "“United weren’t playing exceptionally well, but they were still in a position where finishing in the top four or five was realistic.",
      "“The timing of the decision is a surprise, but I guess other things have come to a head which happens at big clubs like we saw with Chelsea and Enzo Maresca recently.",
      "“I think that situation had an impact on United and I think we might see a lot of changes in the next month or so with other managers after this massive domino has fallen.",
      "“At Chelsea, it seems there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen, and when a lot of people have opinions, not all of them can align.",
      "“Maybe something similar happened with Ruben and United and that’s why communication is super important.",
      "“I feel sorry for him, the club and the fans. At the end of the day, everyone is just trying to do their best.",
      "“Ruben managed a massive club in Portugal and had huge success, which meant everyone was excited to see what he could produce here.",
      "“Unfortunately, it didn’t materialise in the way he envisioned. I think his communication level was remarkable and, if anything, I think he overshared and communicated too much, but there’s no denying that he’s a top manager.",
      "“He has proven that, but this is a different league with greater competition and expectancy at Manchester United.",
      "“Ruben will be fine in the future because he’s an incredible communicator, he’s a smart guy, a gentleman and, hopefully, he’ll enjoy great success. I’m sure he wanted to finish the job here but it wasn’t meant to be.”",

      "A full Premier League fixture list? At this time of the year? In this part of the week? All to be played entirely within 72 hours? We hope you’re prepared for an unforgettable midweek.",
      "It’s the best time of the season, really, and with the FA Cup third round taking place this weekend, there’s something to tickle the tastebuds of every English football fan.",
      "Arsenal, Liverpool and managerless Manchester United are among those who headline the latest Big Midweek.",
      "",
      "This is a fixture that speaks for itself, with two of the Premier League’s big hitters going head to head. Under the lights, no less.",
      "On Thursday night, we will learn a lot about this very strange Liverpool team and just how big a corner they have in fact turned on this increasingly confusing eight-game unbeaten run in Our League. Half of those results have been draws, and two of those draws have come against Leeds United. The Reds are simultaneously showing us that they have the character to recover while displaying no real improvement on the pitch. Teams that show them too much respect get punished – see West Ham, and Fulham to an extent. Get at them, and they are very vulnerable.",
      "This is a Liverpool side that have been playing at a very consistent level all season; they are just going through different sequences. At the start of the campaign it was late, unsustainable wins. Then it became shocking defeat after shocking defeat. When they got out of that funk, they’ve been grinding out results while still performing below expectations.",
      "Premier League leaders Arsenal are sure to get at them and put their turnaround credentials truly to the test.",
      "The Gunners have their own doubters to answer with a win against a Big Six rival. Smashing Aston Villa 4-1 and ending their 11-match winning run was a statement, and beating the current champions would go a long way to proving they will be labelled as such come May, no matter how beatable said champions are right now.",
      "It will be an interesting game between two sides eager and able to make big statements.",
      "",
      "Well, here we are. Another Manchester United manager has fallen. The poisoned chalice remains very much poisoned. Interim boss Darren Fletcher is certainly a manager to watch, but not the manager to watch, with another match having an even juicier storyline to quench our thirst.",
      "There are so many questions worth asking ahead of United’s trip to Burnley, against whom they earned their first Premier League win of the season courtesy of a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty back in August.",
      "Will it look like a Ruben Amorim side? Will Fletcher start his twin sons and wing the rest of his starting XI? Will we see Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system instantly thrown in the bin for a more conventional formation – say, a 4-3-2-1, 4-3-3, or even the good old-fashioned 4-4-2 that won Fletcher so many trophies playing under Sir Alex Ferguson?",
      "We all know that Fletcher won’t line up in a 3-4-2-1, don’t we? There is arguably only one player who exclusively fits that system in the entire squad, and that’s Patrick Dorgu, so it will hardly take much adaptation for a group of players who couldn’t adapt to a new formation in 14 months under Amorim.",
      "It’s a lovely first fixture for United and Fletcher in every sense. There is no team you’d rather face right now than Burnley, who haven’t won since October 26. Win, and Rio Ferdinand and other United fans will get over-excited and proclaim that Fletch is in fact at the wheel. And if they don’t win, it’s quite funny, innit?",
      "It’s not like this is a team in complete and utter disarray either. All things considered, Amorim has left them in a pretty good place. It’s much better than last season, and there have been some positive performances, albeit with results like home draws with Wolves and West Ham, and a home defeat to 10-man Everton thrown in there. Fletcher isn’t replacing a manager sacked after a heavy defeat, but one whose position became untenable after he fell out with his superiors.",
      "The result is important, but we are really more interested to see how much changes, from the formation to how they play.",
      "READ: Fletcher overtakes Glasner as favourite to be the next Man Utd manager after Amorim sacking",
      "",
      "Oh, this will be spicy. We’re not expecting a humdinger between West Ham and Nottingham Forest in Tuesday’s lone Premier League fixture, but there’s a lot on the line as 17th travel to 18th. Neither side has won any of their previous four games. West Ham haven’t won in nine and just handed Wolves their first win of the season at the 20th attempt. That result was made even more amusing by being against Nuno’s old club. Three days later, he faces another of his former employers, but winning will mean so much more.",
      "Nuno didn’t leave Forest on the best of terms. After narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification last term, he lasted three games before being sacked in 2025/26 after falling out with Edu Gaspar, who will be at the London Stadium in what could be his final day as Forest’s global head of football. It really does feel like one of them will be out of a job on Wednesday morning, and whoever ends up safe will absolutely f***ing love it.",
      "The Edu stuff really adds to an already mouthwatering story, but the bottom line is that Nuno really, really needs to win this game. If he doesn’t, he will surely become the first manager to be sacked twice in the same Premier League season. Win, and he puts massive pressure on Forest to claw away from the relegation zone, which increases the possibility of Nuno being directly linked with two relegations in a single Premier League season.",
      "Four points separate the Hammers and Forest after 20 games. Seven points should doom the former. One brings new life to a miserable season.",
      "",
      "There’s no glossing over Palmer’s form since returning from injury. He’s been nowhere near good enough, though Chelsea have been poor as a collective. The England international completely missing the ball to equalise against Manchester City summed it all up on another difficult day away to one of the big boys, a stage where he has so often failed to show up.",
      "It’s not a big hitter on Wednesday night, but a big west London derby nonetheless, as Chelsea make the short trip to take on Fulham, and they need their main man to produce a statement performance. Palmer enjoys playing in London, so there’s a strong chance he does. He hasn’t scored outside the capital in over a year!",
      "There is a mountain of expectation on Palmer’s shoulders to bounce back after a poor showing at the Etihad on Sunday. We all expect so much more, and we are getting dangerously close to calling him a penalty merchant, just like the cool kids on X.",
      "",
      "The Spanish and French Super Cups provide us with three treats this week, with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao, Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille all in action. There is also a full Serie A fixture list, which is fun. But it’s difficult to overlook the Madrid derby.",
      "The two Madrid sides don’t meet in Madrid. They don’t even meet in Spain. They meet in Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia, because why not? There is a great demand for domestic football to be played abroad, right? So much so that it’s being played on a completely different continent. Ahh, modern football, you little dancer.",
      "Kylian Mbappe might not be fit, which takes some of the glamour away, but there’s still Vinícius Junior, who has zero goals in his last 15 games, Thibaut Courtois and Jude Bellingham in the white corner preparing to take on Julian Alvarez, Antoine Griezmann and Jan Oblak in the red-and-white corner.",
      "The superstars are a big part of the entertainment, but these fixtures always bring out the best – which is actually the worst – in some players, and we live for the drama.",
      "Robin Roefs has been the goalkeeper of the season in the Premier League, with Bart Verbruggen not too far behind.",
      "One club and their transfer curse cannot be beaten for January incompetence. It is the only which saves that doomed swap between Arsenal and Man United.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "There’s a surprising amount of sympathy for Ruben Amorim after his sacking by Man Utd as the board gets a kicking.",
      "Manchester United have spent nearly £2bn on 75 players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Including seven Ruben Amorim buys, we’ve ranked them all.",
      "Ruben Amorim might actually be in the wrong category for what will be his final Winners and Losers for a while. Just give him the West Ham shambles."

      "",
      "I was right in the middle of writing a letter about United when they go and sack the manager. So inconsiderate. My first thoughts on the sacking are “Why is my club run by f***ing idiots?”",
      "You appoint a guy knowing it’s a project and might take years to get right. You toil through a year of shit football and embarrassing defeats. You back him to reshape the squad by kicking out the prima donnas. Then when the improvement comes and the team is starting to claw back some semblance of respectability, you sack him for complaining in public about transfers?!? Just staggering levels of stupidity from Berrada and Wilcox.",
      "The letter I was writing explained that despite United being pretty shit they are still on course to meet preseason expectations and only one win behind the most optimistic of these predictions. No one had United making the top 4 this season and with good reason. The squad isn’t good enough.",
      "We know the ‘breakdown in relations’ cited as the reason for sacking Amorim has come about mainly over disagreements on transfers, namely that no reinforcements are arriving this month. So the squad is still not going to be good enough to exceed expectations and now has to transition into a new temporary manager then possibly another mid season appointment. All while still paying Amorim his full wage to sit at home. It’s lunacy!",
      "As usual with United the whole debacle smacks of reactionary short term thinking. There was a very easy case to make for sacking Amorim based solely on results, never mind the other 19 things you came up with, but its that kind of blinkered view that this new leadership were supposed to have moved beyond. I understand I was in the minority in seeing a bright future under Amorim but whether you agree or not with the decision to sack him surely it’s obvious to everyone how this was the worst way to go about it.",
      "For the board to be proved right and justified in sacking him now, results have to improve over the second half of the season. As we’re already on course for 5th-7th place then realistically that would mean achieving 4th. As of this moment Darren Fletcher will have the same thirteen fit first team players to choose from that Amorim had against Leeds, two of which are goalkeepers. I’m not overcome with optimism for the next few months.\nDave, Manchester (At least Neville, Scholes, and Keane will be happy, that’s what really matters.)",
      "",
      "…I feel Amorim may be a little unlucky to lose his job when it seems the squad, atmosphere and league position are better than when he took charge. However, we’ll likely never know the real story behind the final decision to part ways.",
      "I wish the guy well and thank him for trying. We have some exciting attacking players in the squad and maybe a new guy can make a difference. Not a bad time to take over, no immediate expectation of Champions league football this season or a trophy and enough time for a new guy to assess the squad.",
      "I suspect Amorim is leaving due to wanting to stick to his guns on 3-4-3. For that I’d feel a little sorry for him as Utd employed him knowing that. However, the club previously said they would buy players to suit a utd philosophy and not for the manager. I hope they start to live that and I hope we kick on rather than redress to a new managers completely different wants and needs, the cycle continues…\nJon, Cape Town",
      "",
      "The last 3 results make a good case on Amorim being more suited to a mid-table Prem club, not one with high ambitions. A scruffy 1-0 win and 2 hard fought draws with relegation battlers and still being generally relived by those results are the hallmarks of mid-table mediocrity. Amorim was once linked with West Ham and I think he would have been really good for them.",
      "Ten Hag should have been sacked that summer, but management dawdled and set the project back a couple more years. Tuchel would have been the right call to replace Ten Hag then. Now, Glasner’s probably the best pick.",
      "Still, wouldn’t be such a bad idea to make an interim appointment of Carrick or Ole till the end of the season and bring Glasner, Emery or someone else then. One thing they should never ever do is appointing Xavi.",

      "",
      "“The feeling at the club was that as soon as Amorim found himself under pressure he went back to his favoured system – whether it was suitable or not for the opposition.”",
      "I’m not a fan of Amorim. I don’t like his style of play, his preferred formation or the way he makes subs. But… he is the manager. He is the one who gets to pick the team how he thinks best. I have no doubt that he wanted to be successful and to win as many games as possible. He did what he thought was best.",
      "The board do not get a say in which formation is suitable for the opposition. I can see why Amorim was frustrated in the press conference. The board have no place in footballing matters.",

      "As an individual, it feels like the latest in a line of gut punches as the club I grew up supporting continues to morph into just another corporate plaything at an ever increasing pace. I recognise we’ve had 20+ years of Glazernomics at this point, but the INEOS influx feels like things have veered a step further towards boardroom drama being played out in public.",
      "A very quick look at the structure in well run modern football clubs will show a clear delineation between the business on the pitch and in the boardroom, but with a dotted line from both departments pointing in the same direction. If Jason Wilcox, as rumoured, put the manager under pressure to change his formation, you have to wonder what other boneheaded input they’ve had from on high in the past 14 months.",
      "I get that Amorim’s record hasn’t been good. In footballing terms, justification for him continuing in the role was sparse. Improvement from a historically bad first season should be a given, and that improvement should be sustained. 31 points from 20 games doesn’t hit that mark.",
      "BUT there were repeated assurances of continued support when things were at a far lower ebb last season, talk of this not being a quick fix, long term plan etc. Seemingly a recognition of needing to move toxic elements on and build from a fresh platform with a manager hired to concoct a medium-term antidote in playing style and culture.",
      "That was all clearly lip service if they’ve been undermining Amorim behind closed doors, but to what end? He walks with a payoff having clearly become furiously frustrated, possibly to land in a better role before long. The decision makers, meanwhile, have again made themselves look ridiculously short-termist after the mistake of renewing Ten Hag’s contract in Summer 2024 before backpedalling in jig time.",
      "Furthermore, they’ve signalled to every other manager out there that they’re the unchallenged shotcallers in the building and the coach needs to dance to their tune or else. It’s so reminiscent of the ego-driven nonsense that’s typified Chelsea’s managerial churn since Clearlake landed, and I’m really not here for it. Literally only a few days ago I looked at Maresca leaving Chelsea and thought to myself “what a mess it is there”. The irony.",
      "INEOS’ arrival was sold to the fans as a handover of the football operations to an org with a track record of high performance in sport. Blah blah brains trust, Brailsford this, Ashworth that. So far, the concrete evidence suggests that they have no real on-pitch plan and are just making this stuff up as they go along.",
      "New training grounds and stadium plans are all well and good, carry on there lads. But surely you leave the football stuff to the guy you appointed to oversee the football stuff and listen to him when he has reservations about the direction of travel? No? Sack him like a bullet instead? This Is Manchester United Football Club now I guess.\nKeith Reilly",

      "So after Chelsea sacked their manager (who won manager of the month in December), United have followed suit by sacking their manager (manager of the month in November) and it got me thinking, is it the managers, or is it their respective clubs. I’m sure there are people at Spurs with itchy trigger fingers too.",
      "I think both positions are poisoned chalices, but that doesn’t make them unattractive to any manager, young or old. You will be paid a king’s ransom, they are both bin fires so no one will expect immediate results, but the atmosphere and culture at those places sound toxic. However the problem doesn’t seem the person doing the job, but the clubs themselves. And no one has clearly communicated their plan outside.",
      "Whatever iota of good will United had probably vanished when INEOS took over, same with Clearlake. It is funny to see people try and run football clubs like traditional businesses, under the incorrect assumption that their success in other sectors will easily transition into football. They have been found wanting. Cut and slash might appease shareholders, it doesn’t appease fans. There are no alternative metrics you can point to and say they show success – you have one success metric, did you win.",
      "I think Arsenal sidestepped this issue with the appointment of Arteta in a couple of ways. 1) it was never an immediate thing. We’d fallen so far, we had to be realistic. Arteta communicated that this would happen in phases, and to trust the process. The reason it worked was he wasn’t just ‘trusting the process’ – he was the one implementing it. He got rid of all those who weren’t willing or able to work in that unit and rely on what was left. 2) We stopped going for galactico signings and instead focused on the team. He worked on signing players that raised the ceiling of what was expected. He the fixed our defense and a bit of our midfield and this year we got a striker. Slow and steady we got to where we are now.",

From his early press conferences willing suffering onto the new manager bounce period, to the worst PL season in the club’s history, the worst European final performance (against one of the few teams worse in the league – though one that already hammered him that season), to arguably the worst result in the club’s history, to the most ridiculous spectacle of losing at home to 10-men-for-76-mins Everton, to the misery of basically holding on at home against what could well be the worst-ever PL team.",
      "I would possibly have sympathy for the man due to the sheer scale of the humiliation. But he has proven himself to be a liar. All the promises that he’d resign immediately if he wasn’t wanted suddenly evaporated as soon as he sniffed his payoff after the heat finally came from above. There was no other possible outcome after the Leeds press conference – and boy did he earn that sacking, through both words and actions.",
      "Maybe Berrada lied to him too, you can have multiple liars, but what was clearly publicly said was that in Utd’s new structure, the Director of Football sets the vision, style and recruitment and the coach implements it. This is to ensure a consistency across managers so that when one spectacularly underperforms, you have the profile of players to fit the next one. Now I’m no fan of Wilcox, and whoever picked Amorim when his style never fitted the vision should be on very thin ice, but the DoF’s job is to identify and buy players to fit the long-term style of the club, and specifically to avoid clogging the squad with players that would immediately be the wrong fit if the system changes – exactly what has been the problem when Woodward flipflopped between manager styles. Amorim asked him to do his job and to be fair, that’s exactly what it seems he was trying to do.",

      "Manchester United have spent nearly £2billion on 75 players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. We’ve ranked them all.",
      "That is an absolutely incredible amount of money for having won no Premier League titles and to have consistently fallen in and out of the Champions League.",
      "The Red Devils finished 15th under Ruben Amorim last season and have now sacked the Portuguese, with some of his signings pretty high on this list, but none in the top 10…",
      "And now, with talk that Manchester United could have signed Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but instead plumped for Cristiano Ronaldo, Donny van de Beek and Jadon Sancho, we bring you the full updated ranking…",
      "",
      "The Red Devils signed one of the best players in the Premier League on astronomical wages and he seemed to become an incompetent footballer overnight. Nice piano, though.",
      "",
      "Time is up for Sancho at Man Utd. And Chelsea. They paid £5million so they don’t have to sign him permanently. Now at Aston Villa for a season before leaving United for absolutely nothing.",
      "",
      "Who? Exactly.",
      "",
      "Another player who joined with a huge reputation; Falcao failed to rediscover his FC Porto and Atletico Madrid form during his spell with Man Utd and then Chelsea.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we wrote before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. In the end he exited for less than £22m and United felt lucky to get that.",
      "",
      "After signing Benjamin Sesko, United froze Hojlund out against his will. We feel sorry for him, but scoring four goals in 32 matches last season after costing over £60m is unacceptable. He’s doing a little better back in Serie A with Napoli.",
      "",
      "Joining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",
      "",
      "Wearing the No. 7 shirt has become something of a curse since Cristiano Ronaldo left in 2009; even for the Portuguese himself.",
      "Depay came in as a terrific youngster from the Netherlands and took on the famous number. The forward scored seven goals in 53 games and left for Lyon for a little over half of what Man Utd paid for him.",
      "",
      "Schneiderlin was great for Southampton, so Louis van Gaal brought him to Old Trafford where the Frenchman was nowhere near good enough. He left for £20m, so it’s not all bad. Bloody Everton.",

      "",
      "United fumbled a decent goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "When Dubravka joined from Newcastle United, many expected him to feature in the Europa League group stage, but Dubravka only played three cup games before having his loan terminated in January. What a pointless transfer.",
      "",
      "Brought in for the rest of the season in January 2022 after Dubravka’s loan ended. Butland did not make a single appearance for the club.",
      "",
      "Oh my, simply a shambolic signing. We thought Onana was a serious upgrade on David de Gea, but he was a disastrous downgrade. That says a lot as well, because De Gea was awfully error-prone in his last season at Old Trafford.",
      "Onana made some catastrophic errors for United and is now on loan at Trabzonspor watching his value plummet.",
      "",
      "That is an absurd loan fee for an average player.",

      "The Uruguayan right-back played four times in the Premier League for Man Utd.",
      "",
      "Van de Beek’s demise wasn’t completely down to his poor performances, but more down to the fact that he could barely get a kick. He spent a completely bizarre four years as a Manchester United player, making 62 appearances and scoring twice.",

      "Schweinsteiger is a Bayern Munich legend and a forgettable Manchester United midfielder.",

      "Signed as a back-up goalkeeper. Is a back-up goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "There has to be a point when you put your neck on the line and say this guy might not be very good. PSG sold him after one year and then won the Treble, while his new club went from finishing eighth to 15th. Ugarte has looked off the pace from day one and needs to show remarkable improvement to win us, and many others, over.",
      "",
      "James was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",
      "",
      "Erratic and amusing, Bailly was signed for big money and was more comical than he was convincing at defending. Injuries didn’t help him, to be fair.",
      "",
      "He scored a decent amount of goals but didn’t do enough to merit a £76m transfer fee.",
      "",
      "Having paid no transfer fee for the young Dutch winger, Man Utd looked like they did pretty well. He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, where he did quite well.",
      "The Red Devils were right to sell Chong but definitely could have sold him for more.",
      "",
      "Fosu-Mensah was pretty cheap and the club turned a profit in the end. He made 30 first-team appearances and was quite useful due to his versatility.",

      "Often erratic, Rojo was box office at times but had an average spell at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Weghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "He cost an absolute fortune with only a year left on his Chelsea contract and even when fit, he has been very underwhelming.",
      "We all know the ability Mount possesses and we finally got a glimpse in the early stages of this season before, you guessed it, he got injured.",
      "",
      "Pogba left United for Juventus on a free transfer in 2012, only to be re-signed by the Premier League club for a world-record transfer fee, to then return to Turin on a free transfer in 2022.",
      "He was excellent in fits and starts but nowhere near consistent enough. Especially for a world-record transfer.",
      "",
      "The other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",

      "The jury is very much out, but we suspect they are ambling towards a ‘Guilty of being massively overpriced’ verdict.",

      "The jury is most certainly out on this one. He has the work-rate and pace necessary to thrive in wing-back. Now that Amorim is gone, he could be screwed.",
      "",
      "Often the scapegoat and always mocked, the former Man Utd captain has put in many good displays for the club. He’s also made many high-profile errors. Definitely not worth the money he cost, but definitely not as bad as people say.",
      "",
      "Man Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "There was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m.",

      "",
      "Fellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "Martial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He eventually joined AEK Athens on a free transfer.",
      "",
      "Wan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "Varane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "As far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",

      "",
      "It is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "Ajax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another. So far, so average.",
      "",
      "He is comfortably the best signing made in the summer of 2024. Low bar, mind.",
      "",
      "As far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "Competent. And that really is enough.",
      "",
      "Not quite delivered numbers-wise in the early part of 2025/26, but he has fire. And in a sea of sometimes looking like they don’t give a sh*t, that counts for something.",
      "",
      "David Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "A few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club. Still, £53m is steeeeeeep.",
      "",
      "Martinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. After emerging as the club’s most competent defender, he suffered some bad injuries. He’s back now, and is looking pretty good.",
      "",
      "The fact that Eriksen cost nothing carries lots of weight. We expected more, but still don’t feel massively underwhelmed.",
      "",
      "He might already be United’s best centre-half.",

      "Immediately looks like a Manchester United player. Which is less of a compliment than it was 20 years ago, but still…",
      "",
      "Seventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "Dalot is a pretty inconsistent player. He definitely suits a back four more than he does a back five. So, he might become quite good now.",
      "",
      "After a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was pretty much written off. However, his Sunderland loan was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which now looks somewhat reasonable, when it looked frankly ridiculous for a long time.",
      "",
      "Herrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "There’s not a lot to say that has not already been said; £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "After spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was available and willing to join.",
      "In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25 and now 2025/26, he has been one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "",
      "Shaw has had spells where he’s looked like the best left-back in the world, and spells where he’s looked completely hopeless, mainly due to his inability to stay fit. Overall, he’s been a good signing, but the fact he ranks fourth here speaks volumes about United’s woeful transfer business over the last 13 years.",
      "",
      "You might doubt his ability to become a world-class winger, but Garnacho has made United some sumptuous profit. And that’s awful rare for United.",
      "",
      "This is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 70-odd players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "Although his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",

      "Neville reacted to the news on The Premier League Show on Monday evening, claiming that he was “surprised” at the timing, but not that the sacking happened at all.",
      "“It’s a poor reflection upon everybody,” the United legend said. “It means it’s not worked. It means the decision-making all the way through has not been successful. It means the manager hasn’t won enough football matches, and ultimately everybody loses, particularly when you’re sacking a manager partway through a season when it’s very difficult to get an adequate replacement.",
      "“Manchester United, they’ve been here before, and they’re in a challenging position again, but I am surprised that it’s happened this morning. I’m not surprised that it’s happened. I just didn’t realise it would happen so quickly.",
      "“The last week or so, some of the press conferences that we’ve seen, it usually only ends one way, but I did think they would get through another couple of weeks to try and work out what to do.",
      "“Obviously it’s become that challenging internally that they decided to do it very quickly, which was a shock this morning at 10 o’clock when I heard the news.”",
      "Reports suggest that Amorim’s dismissal was down to a breakdown in his relationship with sporting director Jason Wilcox.",
      "It is believed there was a ‘blow-up’ between the pair on Friday, which made the Portuguese head coach’s position untenable.",

      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim, Arsenal, Wolves, Leeds, Frank, West Ham",
      "Neville appreciates that Amorim was consistently honest when speaking to the media but criticised him for turning on his bosses, which he said puts you in a difficult position in any walk of life, whether you’re a Premier League manager or a shelf stacker at a supermarket.",
      "“I would actually be disappointed if there wasn’t a meeting after the Wolves performance,” Neville continued. “I think as a sporting director of a football club or an owner of a football club, you should be entitled to go and speak to a manager when the team have played like they have against Wolves, and basically Wolves have picked up a point at Old Trafford, only their third of the season.",
      "“It seems to me that in the last week, Ruben Amorim has decided that he basically doesn’t feel supported, or he doesn’t feel happy.",

      "Neville doesn’t know who the next manager should be, but insists their philosophy must embody “the Manchester United way”.",
      "“I was thinking about what managers have been appointed at the club over the last 10/12, years,” he said.",

You can’t say they’re not good coaches, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, they’ve all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies, and none of them really fit the Manchester United way.",

      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein was the first to reveal that Man Utd have made the choice to sack Amorim on Monday after his rant against the hierarchy on Sunday.",
      "Man Utd were sixth in the Premier League after a 1-1 draw against Leeds on Sunday but the Red Devils are still just four points off 14th-placed Crystal Palace.",
      "And the Red Devils later confirmed Amorim had left the club in a statement, which read: ‘Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "‘Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",

      "And now Jacobs insists that sacking Amorim could cost Man Utd around £10m with ‘the whole package’ of Amorim at Old Trafford costing between £25m and £30m.",
      "Jacobs said (via The United Stand): ‘Under the terms of his deal and having to pay Ruben Amorim for the remainder of his contract, Man United, in theory, could pay as much as just over £10 million. Including compensation to Sporting and what’s been paid in his current contract, the whole package of Ruben Amorim at Man United is likely to cost around £25-30 million.’",
      "Reddy said on X: “INEOS kept on a manager they had no faith in, openly canvassing Europe for his successor but then armed him with £200m to spend on players he wanted, and changed the backroom staff before sacking him anyway.",
      "“They axed a sporting director, whose way of working was well established, because he did not fit in with how they wanted him to work. He warned them about selecting a head coach attached to a fixed style of play, which didn’t suit the squad and how expensive it would be to build a quality 3-4-3.",
      "“They didn’t listen, insisted they believed wholeheartedly in Ruben Amorim’s approach, but then wouldn’t fully back it in the transfer market and asked him to change the tactical principles that attracted them to him. Some ‘best in class’ decision-making…”",

      "Few will be happier with the sacking of Ruben Amorim than Amorim himself.",
      "Being dumped rarely does much for one’s self-esteem but the now ex-head coach of Manchester United carried the air of a man regretting his life choices for most of 2025. The end for Amorim probably came as sweet relief.",
      "The board won’t resent being pushed into a corner from which they could only escape by swinging the axe. Amorim taunted them to sack him and Sir Jim Ratcliffe never needs an excuse to cut employees adrift.",
      "Few of United’s stars are likely to mourn Amorim’s exit. Who among them has much to lose from it? The players’ social media lackeys will post the usual generic platitudes but most, some now on their third, fourth or even fifth United manager, probably reacted to the news with a shrug of indifference.",
      "The fans? Shoulders will shrug wearier on the Stretford End in anticipation of being told for the seventh time that it’s their job to get behind the new manager. Whoever that might be. Does it even matter anymore?",
      "Whoever takes over from Amorim has to work with a regime that is yet to prove it has the faintest idea what it’s doing. If Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and co. faced a slither of the scrutiny Amorim or his successor faces, they’d surely shrivel.",
      "Not just at United is the director of football, sporting director or CEO the cushiest gig going. All the power, almost none of the accountability. But the size of the spotlight on Old Trafford makes it all the more remarkable that those between Amorim and Ratcliffe can shimmy from scrutiny so easily in the shadows.",
      "What faith can anyone have in the United hierarchy to identify Amorim’s successor?",
      "Many of the problems they encountered with Amorim could have been foreseen before they hired him. His dogmatic faith in his formation cannot possibly have come as a surprise.",
      "It was one of the reasons they hired him. Because they, like so many others, became obsessed with the idea of a philosophy. Something to make them identifiable (synonym: predictable), perhaps a shape to build a brand on. Despite the fact the best coaches in the world all possess enough self-awareness to know that adaptability is an asset. If Sir Alex Ferguson didn’t have such a low opinion of Ratcliffe, he might be more minded to educate him on that.",
      "For that reason, the man who follows the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the man, who followed the Moyes, has the easiest early tap-in of all those post-Fergie managers.",
      "All Darren Fletcher need do is set United up in a formation that suits the players at his disposal. What’s your fancy, Fletch? 4-3-3? 4-2-3-1? Whichever, just please remember that you can change your mind.",
      "Amorim refused to, even if he flirted with the idea, and that will be his legacy. A decent bloke who clearly wanted to succeed and shared many of the same frustrations the fans hold. But, when push came to shove as it inevitably has, Amorim craved validation of his methods above all else.",
      "AMORIM SACKED BY MAN UTD: MORE FROM F365",
      "That defiance along with a piss-poor record means Amorim will be forgotten quicker than even some of his predecessors.",
      "And we know what comes next: Fletcher, already a United hero, will win a few games with players invigorated by a functional formation. And that’ll be nice, won’t it? Then, eventually, an ex-Blackburn winger and former academy manager of Manchester City will anoint the new manager of Manchester United.",
      "Doubtless Wilcox and his cronies will be tempted to hire another up-and-comer without the seniority to overshadow the dubious credentials of those above him. And then we’ll all meet back here in 18 months to do this all again.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",

      "United are understood to have concluded that Amorim's position had become untenable.",
      "Neville said that he was \"stunned\" that during the course of Amorim's reign, Man Utd continued to play so poorly in his back-three system. \"That's a failing upon the manager, the players and the club, in terms of not recruiting properly for it.\"",
      "He has called on Man Utd to now seek out a replacement who can play in the traditional style of the club.",

      "Whilst differences of opinion over transfer policy wasn't the ultimate deciding factor in his departure, it did play a part in the breakdown of relationships with his bosses.",
      "Amorim felt that if he were given more resources now, that would guarantee Champions League football and even bigger financial returns. United's hierarchy have always been adamant they would not take that risk and will shun any return to short-term transfer decisions.",
      "Amorim has told friends he struggled to cope with the noise from outside the club, which he feels undermined the job he was doing.",
      "Whilst he is adamant that the job wasn't too big for him, he was surprised by how political and difficult the role is at Manchester United, and feels it is an impossible job to prepare fully for, because no one understands the unique challenges until they are in place at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese coach feels he had less and less input into footballing decisions as time went on. Whilst he feels he always tried to be true to himself, he accepts that his often emotional response in front of the media was to his detriment.",
      "Amorim departs after 14 months in charge, with his final game the 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's dismissal was announced by Man Utd shortly after 10am on Monday.",

      "But in an apparent pointed message to the Old Trafford hierarchy following Sunday's draw at Leeds, he said he saw himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.\"",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek card.",
      "These are the contests that shape relegation battles. It's going to be ugly and full of tension. And one you won't want to miss.",
      "West Ham's Nuno Espírito Santo versus Nottingham Forest's Sean Dyche is a matchup that doesn't exactly scream 'bring your popcorn'. When these two managers have crossed paths across their careers, goals have been at a premium. That is the betting angle here. Across nine previous meetings, there have been just 19 goals in total, with seven of those games finishing under 2.5 goals.",
      "The managerial matchup here, when added to the likely cup final nature, quietly points toward another low-scoring chapter in the Nuno vs Dyche playbook. The 10/11 with Sky Bet for under 2.5 goals is the obvious play.",
      "Cristian Romero likes to defend in a manner that can quickly tip over from assertive to reckless. It's why referees know his name. Eight yellow cards and a red already this season tells its own story.",
      "Bournemouth are very good at inviting chaos that leads to cards. Andoni Iraola's side want to play quickly, get the ball into feet between the lines and force centre-backs to make decisions they don't want to make. That's where Evanilson comes in - a striker who is a genuine card magnet.",
      "Since the start of last season he's drawn 21 cards from opponents - only Bruno Guimarães has drawn more.",
      "Romero is 2/1 with Sky Bet to be carded. It's a bet.",
      "Robin Roefs has been nothing short of sensational since his £11.5m move from NEC Nijmegen in August. Seven clean sheets bagged already this season, including three in the last five games, tells the story. His save ratio of 78.4 per cent is the best in the league.",
      "Roefs leads all goalkeepers for xG prevented at +4.9, meaning he's conceded almost five goals fewer than expected and only Martin Dubravka has made more saves this season (70). Away from home across his last nine games, he's averaging 4.3 saves per 90 where those backing his 4+ saves line have landed the money in seven of those games.",
      "Brentford arrive in great nick, having taken 10 points and scored 10 goals in their last four games, and are turning games into ones where the opposition goalkeeper is constantly called into action. Roefs to make four or more saves at 10/11 with Sky Bet rates as a value play.",
      "This fixture is all about the dugout dynamic.",
      "Crystal Palace under Oliver Glasner seem to know exactly how to play Aston Villa and Unai Emery. The record is startling. Palace are unbeaten in the last six meetings, winning five of them, with an aggregate score of 19-4. Pure domination.",
      "And when patterns like that persist across different game states, venues and moments in the season, it's fair to declare that Glasner has Emery's number. It's a system Villa have repeatedly struggled to solve. Every time they try to step on Palace, they get pulled into transitional chaos, exactly where Glasner's side thrive.",
      "At Selhurst Park, with Palace's recent dominance in this fixture and a manager who repeatedly outmanoeuvres his opposite number, the fact Palace are the outsiders at 2/1 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy angle to attack.",
      "Defensively, Wolves look transformed.",
      "Across their last five Premier League matches, Wolves have posted an expected goals against figure of just 1.01 per 90 - it's the second-best defensive record in the league over that sample size. And context elevates it further. This run includes games against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool - fixtures that usually inflate defensive numbers rather than squeeze them. West Ham found that out on Saturday.",
      "They were restricted to scraps in terms of attacking return while for the first time this season the Wolves attack found a ruthless streak in the 3-0 win. Similar results may follow in recent weeks.",
      "Everton could struggle to find a way through making the double chance option on the away win a bet to play at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Whether it's Joao Pedro dropping in and rolling defenders or Liam Delap playing on the shoulder and inviting contact, Chelsea's forwards are excellent at turning physical battles into card parties. Fouls get drawn. And cards tend to follow.",
      "Eight centre-backs have been carded against Chelsea in their last 15 games, so Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca could be walking into a proper examination here.",
      "Cuenca's recent record suggests he's not immune to catching the referee's eye. He's been booked in two of his last four games and historically he carries a fairly punchy card profile. A 0.28 cards-per-90 ratio from his time in La Liga tells you he's a defender who plays on the front foot, happy to engage early rather than drop off. The 7/2 with Sky Bet for a Cuenca card has a chance.",
      "Brighton are not your average mid-table Premier League team when visiting the elite, and the numbers prove it.",
      "When you dig into Brighton's data against the Premier League's best in class, the picture becomes very interesting for those of us who like a shot bet when the prices are right.",
      "From 12 games against Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City under Fabian Hurzerler's watch, Brighton have averaged a very impressive 14.5 shots per game to a backdrop of a significantly healthy 1.5 expected goals per game. That is an outrageous output and one which deserves full respect in this fixture where City could be without their first-choice defensive duo in Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.",
      "The markets are behind on this shots curve. We can jump on Brighton to register 10 or more shots at Evens with Sky Bet - something they have landed in their last three head-to-heads with Pep Guardiola's side.",
      "Although Wolves are propping up the division, Burnley, according to the data, are actually the worst of the 20 teams.",
      "Their expected goals against numbers show them conceding 2.00 xG per 90, the worst figure in the division - that's a team consistently allowing opponents high-quality chances in dangerous areas. Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore.",
      "Newcastle have scored at least twice in each of their last 11 home matches. That attacking consistency was on show again last time out when they delivered exactly what was expected by this column against Crystal Palace, where the 10/11 for a home win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals landed. No need to change a winning formula then.",
      "Expect goals, expect control and expect Newcastle to deliver in front of their own fans yet again. The 4/5 on offer through the Sky Bet BuildABet function for Newcastle to win and over 1.5 Newcastle goals remains a bet to follow.",
      "According to the Premier League title-winning odds, it's never been more likely this season than now that Arsenal will land the outright prize. After Chelsea's late salvo at Manchester City, the 1/4 on offer with Sky Bet on Arsenal for the title is the shortest price they've been all season. Only Arsenal can stop Arsenal now.",
      "For this game the under 2.5 goals line is worth a look at 11/10 with Sky Bet. Mikel Arteta and Arne Slot are cut from a similar cloth. Territory matters. Risk management matters. Neither wants a basketball match",
      "When two managers are this obsessed with control, the game often eats itself. In big games between elite managers of this nature, it often promises drama and delivers tension instead. One goal either way could be enough.",

      "The decision to sack Ruben Amorim became inevitable once the Portuguese coach made it clear this was no long-term project but the unravelling of his Manchester United reign damns the decision-makers as well as the coach, writes Adam Bate",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 14:15, UK",
      "The end of yet another error. Manchester United’s decision to sack Ruben Amorim midway through the season leaves the club in rebuild mode for a second consecutive campaign, their commitment to this latest project unceremoniously abandoned.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe had boldly claimed that Amorim was doing a great job. Omar Berrada, the club's chief executive, argued that come the summer the worst would be behind them. As both are belatedly learning, things can always get worse at United.",
      "August brought defeat to fourth-tier opposition for the first time in their history, Amorim unable to watch as United were dumped out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby. Fiddling with his tactics board that night, he became the face that launched 1,000 memes.",
      "September brought defeat at Brentford, a game which ended with Amorim repeating his experiment of playing Mason Mount at left wing-back. Only October brought some relief, an unexpected win over Liverpool at Anfield and the manager of the month award.",
      "But, in November, they were beaten by Everton at Old Trafford, losing a Premier League home game against 10 men for the first time. In December, they somehow contrived to allow a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches to leave with a point.",
      "It ends in January after a draw at Leeds, conceding in 15 consecutive away games for the first time in Premier League history. Not because of that result but because the relationship between Amorim and those above him had become broken beyond repair.",
      "The realisation of how much work remained was a source of tension. Amorim had been given a new £200m forward line but still wanted more there and in almost every other area of the pitch. His demands came from a weak position as faith in him faded.",
      "Berrada talked of a \"very clear identity\" but even that was being compromised by the end. Having moved on his wingers, he finally switched to a back four - inexplicably suggesting the reason he had not made the change earlier was because of the media.",
      "Even then, after limping to victory over Newcastle in that system, he reverted back and failed to beat Wolves. Gary Neville was frustrated. That Amorim name-checked him after his final game in charge suggests those frustrations were shared within the club.",
      "United's decision-makers will be criticised for this folly and rightly so. The award of a new contract to Erik ten Hag only to sack him in October of last season did not present the best conditions for Amorim to take the job - something he was acutely aware of.",
      "It always came with risk. Liverpool opted against Amorim because of the incompatibility of his formation, going with the greater continuity afforded by appointing Arne Slot and being rewarded with the Premier League title. But Amorim was on their radar.",
      "His reputation had been well earned, having had nothing but success at Portugal, building the best Sporting side for a generation, a first title in 19 years. And there were very good reasons why United were more amenable to change than Liverpool.",
      "Having finished outside the top seven under Ten Hag, there was an appetite among supporters for something more than mere evolution and Ratcliffe was happy to sell that idea. He wanted to disrupt things at Old Trafford and Amorim could be his instrument.",
      "But few could have anticipated it being quite so fraught.",
      "Amorim was afforded extraordinary levels of patience and Ten Hag's own struggles only partially explain it. The Portuguese picked up fewer points in his first six games than the Dutchman had mustered in his last six - and things actually got worse from there.",
      "Amorim averaged a point a game last season across 27 matches, putting them 16th in the table during that period - which is where they finished. Worth a reminder, perhaps, that while United were meandering when he arrived, they were only four points off third.",
      "Failing to qualify for Europe changed the financial picture, slowing the pace of change and making it more difficult for Amorim to overhaul the squad. Although, his unwillingness to trust Kobbie Mainoo had some fans questioning his plans for it anyway.",
      "There were grumbles when he refused to change shape when chasing games, making like-for-like substitutions in the devastating Europa League final defeat to Tottenham. The familiar sight of swapping centre-backs late on bewildered many at Old Trafford.",
      "And yet, United's match-going supporters are a loyal bunch and few will be celebrating his exit. They had hoped against hope that this would work after more than a decade of disappointments. They were willing to trust that all this was actually going somewhere.",
      "It is why, for all his failings, Amorim was undone by his comments as much as the results. Speaking about his relationship with the club in that press room in Leeds, he concluded: \"[It] is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on.\"",
      "That laid bare to everyone the fact that this new path that Amorim was on was not leading to a new era, the next United dynasty. In his own words, even if the club were to let him to see out his deal, this project was already nearer to the end than the beginning.",
      "Framed in that context, it was only natural to question the point in proceeding down said path. And so, having tried the big characters, the club heroes, United's investment in this tactical bright young thing has been aborted too. The end of yet another error.",

      "Ruben Amorim's sacking was inevitable and predictable.",
      "There was an awful lot of optimism when he first joined - both from the Manchester United bosses and from supporters.",
      "But in truth, he never seemed comfortable in the job.",
      "The United hierarchy were desperate to give him a full season in charge before judging him - partly because of the cost of sacking him, which will now be £12m, but also because of the recurring instability that inevitably happens if you regularly change the man at the top.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, Amorim was the 10th manager to be appointed. But results were so poor, they never afforded the club's bosses, or Amorim, the luxury of time.",
      "Despite spending over £200m on attacking talent in the summer, despite the Portuguese coach having a full pre-season to get his message across, despite many of the statistics pointing to improved performance levels from the team, despite the man himself coping well with the media scrutiny and being well-liked across the board at the club…the results were awful.",
      "Amorim is a decent, honest, hard-working guy. But he had to go.Rob Dorsett",
      "Stubbornness forms the very basis of where many fans will feel Amorim got it wrong. But could the Portuguese head coach's downfall be pinned on a specific decision? Bruno Fernandes' importance to Manchester United goes without saying.",
      "His 100 goals for the club tell a story of the level of consistency and performance he's displayed since arriving at Old Trafford nearly six years ago.",
      "Ask anyone who United's best player is and the majority will reply with Fernandes. However, in the summer, there was an opportunity to move away from him.",
      "Rightly or wrongly, representative of an era at United, Fernandes had an offer to move to Saudi Arabia, which would have seen United potentially make £100m from his departure. That money could have been reinvested to plug United's overstated midfield holes.",
      "Instead, the player became a symbol of Amorim's hard-headed approach. Amorim's insistence on deploying him as one of his two midfielders has hampered United.",
      "As captain, Fernandes is Amorim's go-to in midfield and for the former Sporting coach, he contended for the position with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "That's a scenario that has seen the England international and a favourite among fans find minutes hard to come by, which hasn't helped Amorim's case with the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "Stubborn by nature, Amorim would tell you he'd make the same decision to keep Fernandes, knowing what would ultimately be his fate. However, it is now clear that Fernandes was the catalyst for Amorim's United demise.William Bitibiri",
      "Amorim has had an uphill task since day one - and that is down to Manchester United's dithering over Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman looked set to leave after salvaging an FA Cup win at the end of a disappointing 2023/24 season. It was a chance for him to leave on a high and for the club to move on. But instead, after sounding out various alternatives, United decided they could find no better option, so handed Ten Hag a contract extension - and a heap of money in the transfer window.",
      "He was also given a say on who to bring in. \"He did have a voice, which is why there were one or two Dutch players,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe memorably said. Players Ten Hag had coached at former clubs were also added to the squad.",
      "In summer 2024, Man Utd signed Netherlands internationals Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee, along with Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui - who played for Erik ten Hag at Ajax - and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Nine games into the new 2024/25 season, the United decision-makers changed their mind again and sacked him before installing Amorim.",
      "A new manager in a new league, trying to implement a new system with players signed for a different manager… what could go wrong?",
      "It now looks like folly not to have given Amorim a full pre-season and transfer window in the summer of 2024 to shift the style of play and approach at the club. The good feeling from the FA Cup win could have provided a welcome launch pad.",
      "\"It was the wrong decision,\" Ratcliffe concluded about the whole Ten Hag mess.",
      "Prior to Amorim's appointment, there were reports he would have preferred to have waited until the end of the season before leaving Sporting for United. If he had been given a full run-in to his first campaign, the transition could have been a whole lot smoother and successful.Peter Smith",
      "Manchester United scored just 44 league goals in 2024/25 - their lowest recorded total since 1973/74, when they were relegated from the First Division - so this summer was about putting a new forward line and in came Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "An impressive triple capture, and one that cost £207.2m. It represented a huge outlay for a club without European football, but illustrated just how keen they are to ensure the absence from Europe lasted one season and one season only.",
      "But how costly was it that the midfield was, on the face of it, not treated with the same urgency? Amorim did not sign a single midfielder during his time in charge.",
      "Fernandes is one of the first names on the team sheet, and rightly so, but the options for partners are limited.",
      "It is a similar story in goal. Andre Onana played only three of the last seven league games last year before being loaned out to Trabzonspor. Amorim initially persisted with Altay Bayindir despite the £18.2m arrival of Senne Lammens. Eyebrows were raised with the signing of Lammens, with just 54 league appearances to his name, but he has been United's No 1 since October.",
      "One problem area has been remedied, but a lack of similar work elsewhere has played its part.Dan Long",
      "Amorim, INEOS, the Manchester United squad - nobody comes out of this mess looking good. But spare a thought for 3-4-3.",
      "The mere mention of the formation is likely to induce cold sweats among United fans. The depths their side have plumbed in a bid to get to grips with the system have been so low that some pundits have insisted it can never work in the Premier League.",
      "But that isn't true. Chelsea won the Premier League in 2017 playing 3-4-3. Crystal Palace have enjoyed remarkable success under Oliver Glasner with the system. And let's not forget Amorim's exploits at Sporting using 3-4-3 earned him the Old Trafford job.",
      "The issue was not the system - it was the United squad's inability to perform within it, and Amorim's bizarre refusal to adapt that doomed his reign.",
      "As Adam Bate pointed out here, data analysis suggested 3-4-3 was a long way down the list of formations that suited the squad Amorim inherited. The system requires athletic wing-backs who can contribute in both boxes, versatile No 10s and an effective No 9.",
      "The squad that Amorim took over barely had any of those, yet he ploughed on. Mainoo up front? Fernandes as a No 6? Mason Mount at wing-back? All in service to the system.",
      "Should United's players have done a better job adapting to their head coach's demands? Certainly. Should INEOS have foreseen Amorim's incompatibility with the squad he was being handed? No doubt. And Amorim's refusal to change had long since passed the stage of being self-defeating.",
      "But the 3-4-3 formation has worked before and will work again - just don't expect to see United using it any time soon.Joe Shread",
      "Amorim now joins an ever-growing list of names who have tried - and failed - to drag Manchester United back to their former heights.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Ten Hag and now Amorim.",
      "A list compiled of names with differing levels of experience and success but there is a common theme from their time at Old Trafford. It ultimately did not work.",
      "Rangnick spoke of the \"open heart surgery\" United needed during his time at the club from December 2021 to May 2022 - but what else can be done?",
      "The ownership structure has changed, new head coaches arrived with their own ideas and fresh investment was inserted across all areas of the squad over the years. But the same issues persisted.",
      "At some point, you have to question whether it is possible to replicate Sir Alex Ferguson's success in Manchester almost 13 years ago.",
      "Their former glory, although historic and woven into English football history forever, casts an immediate shadow on those who fill the hot seat and the expectations that come with it, albeit outdated, set them up for failure regardless of formation, signings and results.Patrick Rowe",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."
