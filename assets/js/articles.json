      "Manchester United face Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday afternoon in Michael Carrick's second match in charge. The former United midfielder took the reins before the Manchester derby and defeated Pep Guardiola's side 2-0 in a stunning first result at the helm.",
      "Alongside the chaos of the season on the field, there is plenty of drama off it, too. The January transfer window is drawing to a close, with just over a week until it slams shut, and there is plenty of business to do. It was revealed on Friday that Casemiro would be leaving the club at the end of the season after four years in Manchester.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "Carlos Baleba's price tag has emerged, with the Daily Mail reporting that Brighton are expecting a fee in the region of £60-75million.",
      "The south coast club are reportedly interested in cashing in during the summer and would be willing to sell should a suitable bid be made. Baleba was previously valued at around £100m, with United losing interest last summer when informed of the price tag. Now, though, they could sign him for £40m less.",
      "Considering the midfielder is still under contract with the club until 2028, this is a significant price drop and could prove a shrewd piece of business if United are still interested in him. With Casemiro moving on, he would be an ideal long-term replacement.",
      "According to the I Paper, Adam Wharton and Baleba have emerged as more realistic targets for United because Elliot Anderson has his heart set on Manchester City.",
      "Elliott Anderson is a man in demand(Image: Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson is one of the most sought-after talents in the Premier League, and a move to a big six club has been widely touted for some time now.",
      "City have reportedly sent scouts to watch Anderson on 10 occasions, and if the 24-year-old was added to the squad, Pep Guardiola would likely have the strongest side in the league on paper.",
      "If United are to have any hope of landing Anderson, they must secure Champions League football next season. Fail to do so, and Anderson's preference will be a foregone conclusion.",

      "Ramsus Hojlund has enjoyed an impressive spell with Napoli(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is relishing the chance to link up with Romelu Lukaku at Napoli ahead of his much-anticipated return. The Danish forward has enjoyed an impressive season on loan in Italy from Manchester United.",
      "He has nine goals to his name in all competitions and it is expected that the Serie A giants will activate their option to sign him permanently. While Hojlund has enjoyed a bright season thus far, he could face added competition for his position in the near future.",
      "Former United and Chelsea striker Lukaku has recently returned from a lengthy lay-off, having picked up a long-term injury in pre-season. The Belgian is expected to be in the squad to face Juventus this weekend.",
      "Despite that, Hojlund has not ruled out the prospect of playing with Lukaku, having praised his colleague for his advice so far. Speaking to DAZN Italia, he said: “He helped me a lot so far, since he’s come back from the recovery in Belgium, he’s been around the group a good bit.",
      "“We complement each other on the pitch, it could be a good thing both as a competitor for places, but also playing alongside each other.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“It’s not for me to decide, but when I get asked if we can play together, I say yes. I don’t see why we shouldn’t be able to do it.”",
      "Another influence behind Hojlund’s bright start to life with Napoli has been boss Antonio Conte. The Italian has regularly praised his forward for his talents, albeit has rarely said it to Hojlund himself.",
      "The striker added: “He doesn’t say it very often, it’s nice to hear in interviews. I just want to focus on learning from him and listening to everything he says, because he really is an incredible manager. I’m sure he can help me become a better player than I am.”",
      "Lukaku has missed a large chunk of the season with injury(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Asked what his targets were for the remainder of the campaign, Hojlund replied: “As a striker, it’s obviously important to score goals, provide assists, and help the team, but for me it’s always been about playing a lot of games, helping the team being near the top of the table.",
      "“If I don’t score any more goals this season and we win another trophy, then I’d be happy with that. I want to score even more goals and assists, but I can help the team win in different ways, like holding up the ball and pressing from the front. I can improve my goal numbers, but also other parts of my game.”",

      "But it has not been the homecoming that fans or the club were hoping for. Benfica are currently unbeaten in the Portuguese league, but are sitting third in the table and 10 points behind current leaders Porto.",
      "They are also under real threat of missing out on a spot in the Champions League playoffs, while they were eliminated from the Portuguese Cup at the quarter final stage. Fans have since attempted to take matters into their own hands.",
      "According to Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha, a group of 200 fans stormed the club’s training ground in Seixal demanding to speak with club officials including Mourinho, technical director Simao Sabrosa and captain Nicolas Otamendi.",
      "Initially, four members of the group were allowed to enter before they demanded the rest join them. Police were called to maintain order but allowed the supporters in after they claimed they would protest peacefully.",
      "The fans eventually managed to speak with Mourinho, Simao and Otamendi on one of their training pitches and left after an hour. President Rui Costa has already given his take on the current situation.",
      "Asked if the club could look to move Mourinho on, he replied: “No. He’s an excellent coach and has already proven that. It’s not an easy season. Changing the coach? That’s out of the question.”",
      "Asked if the club could make any more signings, Costa added: “I can’t promise anything, but we’ll see until the end of the transfer window. As you know, we’ve already talked about the sporting side. It’s not a positive year.",

      "“We will fight until the last second for our objectives. There’s still the championship to fight for.”",
      "Benfica are back in action on Sunday as they take on Estrela da Amadora in the league, while they will then resume their Champions League campaign against Mourinho’s former club Real Madrid. The Portuguese side must win and hope results go for them to stand any chance of sealing a spot in the playoffs.",

      "Kai made his Old Trafford debut on Friday, coming on as a substitute in extra time as United's U-18s secured a 2-1 victory over Derby U-18s in the FA Youth Cup fourth round.",
      "Wayne and his wife Coleen were spotted in the stands, despite the former England captain being officially 'banned' from attending Kai's games due to the attention his presence often draws.",
      "Fans frequently swarm Wayne for autographs, prompting Kai to restrict him from watching live matches to avoid distractions at pitch-side. \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained in 2024.",

      "Kai made his debut for United's U-18s in August last year, aged just 15. Fittingly, the fixture came against Everton, his dad's boyhood club. He has made a handful of appearances for the team in the months since and has regularly impressed, particularly as one of the youngest players in the age group.",

      "Kai made his Old Trafford debut five years after signing his first contract with the very club where his father shone so brilliantly, becoming United's all-time leading scorer. As he stepped onto the pitch, just over 2,000 spectators serenaded him with chants of \"Rooney, Rooney.\"",
      "While Kai is well on his way to carving out his own path, it's worth remembering that Wayne had already burst onto the scene at Everton at the same age, famously scoring a long-range goal against Arsenal to become one of the youngest goalscorers in Premier League history.",

Should Liverpool fail to win and United claim victory, they'll climb above their rivals into fourth spot. Given that impressive showing against City and Liverpool's patchy run, it's a realistic prospect.",

      "Previous manager Ruben Amorim prohibited three practices during his tenure at the club: using international breaks as holidays, consuming food in the dressing room on matchdays, and coaches over-complicating instructions to players.",

      "Brooklyn Beckham is no longer on speaking terms with his parents(Image: Getty Images)",
      "A letter Victoria Beckham once wrote to herself about Sir David has added a fresh dimension to the increasingly bitter rift between the couple and their son, Brooklyn. Last week, the Beckhams' eldest child took to social media to publicly criticise his parents, branding them \"controlling\" and accusing them of attempting to \"ruin\" his relationship with his wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham.",
      "The comments come after years of mounting tension within the family, with Brooklyn and Nicola frequently positioned at the centre of the feud. Much has been made of David and Victoria's meticulous focus on their public image and the cultivation of 'Brand Beckham', leading some observers to suggest that aesthetics and reputation have been prioritised over family harmony.",
      "But a letter written by the former Spice Girl for British Vogue, reflecting on her first meeting with her future husband in 1997, offers a different perspective. Far from image-obsessed, it suggests that family and shared values have long been at the heart of the Beckham partnership.",
      "\"It will happen to you in the Manchester United players' lounge. Although you will get a little drunk, so exact details are hazy,\" Victoria wrote.",
      "\"While the other football players stand at the bar drinking with their mates, you will see David standing aside with his family. (He's not even in the first team at this stage - you are the famous one.) And he has such a cute smile.",
      "\"You, too, are close to your family, and you will think how similar he feels to you. He's going to ask for your number. (He still has the London-to-Manchester plane ticket on which you wrote it.)\"",
      "Brooklyn's relationship with Nicola began in 2019, with the pair getting engaged in 2020 before eventually tying the knot in 2022. While relations were said to be warm at first, cracks began to emerge in the lead-up to the wedding.",

      "A major source of friction is widely believed to stem from the controversy surrounding Nicola's wedding dress. She is understood to have initially planned to wear a gown designed by Victoria's fashion label, before ultimately choosing a custom Valentino creation for her walk down the aisle.",
      "Brooklyn has claimed that his mother \"cancelled making Nicola's dress at the eleventh hour... forcing her to urgently find a new dress.\" He also asserted that on the night before the wedding, family members told him Nicola was \"not blood\" and \"not family.\"",
      "The aspiring chef went on to accuse Victoria of \"hijacking\" his first dance with Nicola at the reception, before allegedly behaving \"inappropriately\" on the dancefloor - actions he claims left him feeling \"uncomfortable\" and \"humiliated.\" On Friday, wedding DJ Fat Tony offered further insight into the incident.",
      "Tensions in the Beckham family appeared to flare up in the lead-up to Brooklyn and Nicola's wedding(Image: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)",
      "\"There was no sl*t-dropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action,\" he said during an appearance on ITV's This Morning. \"[Pop star] Marc Anthony was performing, and he called Brooklyn onto the stage. Everyone then expected Nicola to go up and do the first dance.\"",
      "He explained that Anthony then asked the \"most beautiful woman in the world\" to join Brooklyn on the dancefloor before saying Victoria's name instead of the bride's. \"Brooklyn was devastated as he thought he was about to get his first dance with his wife,\" he added.",
      "\"Nicola had left the room crying her eyes out, and Brooklyn is stuck there on stage. They then do this dance, and Marc goes, 'Put your hands on your mother's hips' and it was a Latin thing. The whole situation was very awkward for everyone in the room.\"",
      "Brooklyn savaged both his parents in a bombshell social media post last week(Image: Vianney Le Caer/Invision/AP)",
      "Reports of issues in the family quickly began circulating in the aftermath - and while attempts to quash those rumours with several joint public appearances together helped, things escalated in 2025 when Brooklyn and Nicola decided not to attend David's 50th birthday party.",
      "Months later, David and Victoria were notably absent from Brooklyn and Nicola's vow renewal ceremony, signalling a deep divide. Later in the year, Brooklyn was nowhere to be seen when his father was officially knighted.",
      "A few weeks later, it emerged that Brooklyn had blocked his parents and siblings on social media and had sent a letter to David and Victoria demanding that all future communication go through his lawyers.",

      "Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho were among the players allowed to leave Manchester United in the summer(Image: Nigel French/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United ushered in a fresh era with Michael Carrick's first match in the dugout. The impressive win and outstanding display in last weekend's Manchester derby seemed a far cry from the gloomy atmosphere that characterised Ruben Amorim's spell in charge.",
      "There had been some hope under the Portuguese head coach during the summer transfer window following United signing a new goalkeeper and attacking options. Amorim was also forthright about those he wanted to offload, with five players being excluded from his plans for the season.",
      "This led to permanent transfers for Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to Chelsea and Real Betis, respectively. Marcus Rashford secured a loan switch to Barcelona and Jadon Sancho temporarily moved to Aston Villa, while Tyrell Malacia stayed at Old Trafford. Here's how the five players have responded since expressing a desire to leave United in the summer.",
      "Carrick's appointment as interim manager signals a new beginning and potentially provides an opportunity for Rashford to rejoin his boyhood club. The striker rapidly lost favour under Amorim, moving to Villa last year before completing a summer loan switch to Barcelona.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "In October, when asked if he wished to remain with Barcelona, Rashford told ESPN: \"Oh yeah, for sure. I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game. For a player it is an honour.\"",
      "Rashford has netted eight goals and provided 11 assists in 29 appearances for Barcelona, who can sign him permanently for £26million. Despite the 28-year-old confirming his wish to stay, new United boss Carrick offers hope that the situation may still change.",
      "Rashford is familiar with the United manager, having shared the pitch with him on 48 occasions during his playing career. Until a permanent transfer to Barcelona is completed, there remains a possibility - albeit a remote one - that Rashford might opt to play under his former team-mate at Old Trafford.",
      "Marcus Rashford has relished his loan spell at Barcelona(Image: Michael Regan - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "The young winger's time at United seemed all but over following remarks he made after being left on the bench for last season's Europa League final. Garnacho did demonstrate moments of brilliance in a United jersey before Chelsea pounced to secure a £40m deal.",
      "Like his former club, the 21-year-old has encountered a managerial change this season amid an inconsistent start at his new club. In 23 outings, Garnacho has found the net six times and contributed three assists across all competitions.",
      "Antony is among the latest in a growing list of players who have improved after leaving Old Trafford. Having struggled to justify his substantial transfer fee at United, the Brazilian started to rediscover his best form during his loan stint at Real Betis last season.",
      "The Spanish side waited until September to finalise a deal that could reach £21.6m but he's already proving to be excellent value for Betis. Antony has registered 15 goal contributions in 23 appearances for his new side, who are once more pursuing European football.",
      "Jadon Sancho has not been a regular starter for Aston Villa(Image: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)",
      "There was considerable fanfare when Jadon Sancho arrived from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 but the winger is currently on his third loan spell away from United. Chelsea paid United £5m to avoid making his transfer permanent in the summer, prompting the 25-year-old to join Aston Villa.",
      "Sancho has yet to make a significant impression for Unai Emery's team, failing to score or provide an assist in his first 18 matches, though Villa's injury crisis could soon result in an extended run in the side. The attacker is currently in the final months of his United deal, but there is an option for a one-year extension.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is another player approaching the end of his United contract. The defender was told he could look for opportunities elsewhere, having spent part of the previous season on loan at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "However, the full-back stayed at United and was ultimately brought back into the first-team setup after working hard to return to fitness. The 26-year-old has regularly found himself as an unused substitute since being recalled to the squad, apart from a brief outing against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "While Carrick offers Malacia an opportunity to make an impression on a new coach, the Dutchman faces significant competition at left-back and has reportedly held talks over his future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The 33-year-old Brazilian’s whopping £350,000-per-week contract expires this summer, with United opting not to renew his deal. The five-time Champions League winner joined United for £60million in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge and proved an instant hit, scoring seven goals and providing seven assists that season despite being a defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro’s Old Trafford career has seen him play 146 games and score 21 goals to date, though the veteran’s biggest contributions were on the defensive end. Comments made by United team-mate Shaw reflected that defensive importance during his first season, when the English left-back highlighted how highly the rest of the Red Devils dressing room rated his tackling, while also mentioning perhaps his biggest flaw.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Shaw revealed in a press conference in 2023: \"I think it's obvious to see how important he is to the team. For us as defenders, it gives us a feeling of security. He loves to win the ball back and tackle.",
      "\"We joke he likes to give the ball away so he can win it back. I'm very happy to have him back tomorrow night because he's been a big miss for us.\"",

Casemiro is a player that I’d particularly like to have on my team,\" Barcelona's Raphinha told ESPN Brasil.",
      "\"Because in addition to the experience he has in football, in the things he has achieved in football, he’s a great leader, he’s a great person and he manages to complete a team with the football, with the quality he has, and with the defensive part that for me, he’s one of the best defensive midfielders in the world.\"",

      "Such comments highlight the defensive qualities United and Michael Carrick’s managerial successor will miss next season, as well as his experienced voice in the dressing room. Several young midfielders have already been linked with a United transfer as the club look to rebuild their engine room.",
      "Casemiro said this week: \"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life. From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",

      "According to the Colombian's father, Falcao considered United the most important club in England and was prepared to turn down offers from their biggest rivals in order to call the Theatre of Dreams home.",
      "The striker first emerged on the world stage with Porto before his time with Atletico Madrid saw him become regarded as one of Europe's most potent strikers. A record of 70 goals in 91 games in Spain saw Falcao lead Diego Simeone's side to back-to-back Europa League titles in 2011 and 2012.",

      "Radamel Garcia, Falcao's father and a former footballer who represented Colombia and played at the 1980 Summer Olympics, listed the clubs his son rejected in order to join United. \"Manchester United is the most important team in England and one of the most powerful financially,\" he said on Colombian radio.",

      "He explained: \"Things did not happen with Real Madrid because if you have money and you go to the shops to buy a shirt or trousers, you have to decide if you buy it or not. So Real Madrid opted not to do it, and you can't do anything about that.

      "James Garner has signed a new long-term deal at Everton after snubbing a possible return to Manchester United. The Red Devils had identified the 24-year-old as a potential signing as they aim to sign a new midfielder.",
      "Other targets included Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson. A move for Garner is now a non-mover, however, with the ex-United prospect having penned a new contract with Everton until 2030.",
      "Speaking after his extended stay at Hill Dickinson Stadium was confirmed, Garner said: \"I'm really excited to commit my future to Everton. I'm very grateful for all the support and all the love I've had over the past three-and-a-half years, but it's just the start.",
      "\"I've seen the progress we've made recently. Now I want to be part of that progress and get us back to where the club deserves to be.",

      "\"I feel like I'm now a part of the club and I'm hoping to be a part of it for a long time. I've got family members who are all Evertonians, so I know exactly the passion and, like I've just said, what it means to play for such a massive football club like this.\"",
      "He added: \"I'm still only 24. I feel like I've been through a lot of experiences. I want to keep improving. I think the obvious one would be goals and assists, which is the one everyone wants to get better at.",
      "\"As well as that, I want to keep that overall consistency, and be a player who other people can look to as a leader, setting the right examples.",
      "\"The manager has really trusted me - and what he asks of me to do on a game day, it suits exactly how I play. He's been really important since he's come in.\"",
      "James Garner has signed a new deal with Everton.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Everton boss David Moyes added: \"We're really pleased to have Jimmy commit his long-term future to Everton.",
      "\"He is a player who has developed hugely during his time at Everton. He's taking on more responsibility and we're now seeing a really important midfielder, with the versatility to play in other positions, as well as someone who is turning into a leader for us.",
      "\"He is still only 24 years of age, and we hope he will continue to progress while playing a big part in pushing us forward in the future.\"",

      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund could be joined by a familiar face.(Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund could potentially be joined by another Manchester United colleague at Napoli. The Italian heavyweights are reportedly keen on securing Jadon Sancho.",
      "The winger has endured difficulties since his big-money switch to Old Trafford and he has spent periods on loan at Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and currently Aston Villa. Sancho experienced a rift with Erik ten Hag and, following Chelsea's decision to pay a fee to avoid making his transfer permanent, was forced to train separately from United's first-team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho has frequently been linked with a switch to Serie A. Juventus tried to secure the England international in 2024, while Roma seemed close to finalising a deal for Sancho before he moved to Aston Villa.",
      "The Giallorossi eventually recruited Leon Bailey from the Midlands outfit, instead. His loan arrangement has been cancelled this month, though, to open up a door.",
      "Now, Napoli are the latest club to be attracted by Sancho's abilities, despite his current loan at Villa Park. Antonio Conte's side have included Sancho among their targets, according to Tuttomercatoweb.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Napoli may consider entering the market following a significant setback to their squad, with David Neres set to undergo surgery for a tendon problem and potentially facing two months on the side-lines.",
      "Sancho's contract with United expires at the end of the season, though the club retain the option to extend his agreement by an additional year. Napoli are unlikely to be deterred by Sancho's spell at United - considering the displays they have secured from McTominay and Hojlund.",
      "The former was crowned Serie A's outstanding player following his role in inspiring their championship triumph.",
      "Jadon Sancho has been linked with a transfer to Italian outfit Napoli.(Image: )",
      "Denmark international Hojlund has netted a respectable nine goals in 26 appearances for Napoli - including a vital double against Juventus. That tally already sits just one strike short of his entire output from last season.",
      "For the time being, Sancho remains on loan with Aston Villa, and he found the net for the first time in their colours during a 1-0 triumph over Turkish outfit Fenerbahce, in Thursday night's Europa League encounter. The 25-year-old's 25th-minute header proved the difference and Sancho took a swipe at his former managers afterwards.",
      "The United loanee is thriving under Unai Emery and he remarked: \"It's nice to have a manager who backs you and obviously believes in you. Again, every opportunity I get, I'm going to try and do 100 per cent, and hopefully I can deliver more goals.\"",
      "Speaking last month, amid rumours that Sancho's loan arrangement could be terminated prematurely, Emery also offered his support to the winger. He commented: \"Jadon's still being young.",
      "\"He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But, in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea. He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him, hopefully we can get it.\"",

      "Oliver Glasner will remain at Crystal Palace until the end of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Oliver Glasner does not regret his “emotional” outburst following Crystal Palace’s defeat to Sunderland but insisted “everything is cleared” with chairman Steve Parish.",
      "The Eagles boss said his side felt “abandoned” with “no support” following that 2-1 loss, Palace’s first match without former captain Marc Guehi, shortly before the defender finalised a move to Manchester City. Parish was forced to consider whether to sack Glasner before his contract expires in the summer and a potential move to Manchester United is on the cards.",
      "Glasner announced last week that he will not sign a new deal with Palace, putting him in the picture for the United job in the summer, when they will appoint a long-term successor to Ruben Amorim. His subsequent rant against the Eagles hierarchy could have spelled the end of his time in south London, but he has cleared the air with Parish.",
      "“No, I don’t regret (it),” said Glasner. “Do I think it was the best way? No, I don’t think so, but that’s Oliver Glasner. I think it’s also a part of what we achieved together, that I’m that emotional. I think it helps to create the spirit, that togetherness, that belief. Sometimes maybe it’s not the best possible way, but that’s me.",
      "“I don’t say I’m perfect. I would like to be. On the other side, I never attacked anyone personally. I just explained my feelings about the situation.”",
      "The Austrian last week confirmed he would be leaving last season’s FA Cup winners, who are on a 10-game winless run across all competitions, when his contract expires at the end of the season. Glasner added: “I don’t regret it because I know how I am, about who I am. I was asked, ‘Do you think, could this happen again?’ I said yes, because that’s how I am.”",
      "The 51-year-old revealed he had a “very long dinner” with co-owner Parish, one he felt was a “very, very good talk for both of us”, though added “nothing changed” about his decision to leave. Glasner also emphasised his issue was not with the idea of selling his captain in principle, but with how the situation was handled.",
      "Marc Guehi's exit to Manchester City annoyed Oliver Glasner(Image: PA)",
      "“One year ago in February I agreed to sell Marc. It’s all about timing and replacement,” Glasner revealed. “I know that Crystal Palace will always sell players if they have big offers from other clubs, but it was just the situation, telling the team 28 hours before a Premier League game that the captain is leaving. This was my feeling at that moment.”",
      "Glasner, who was adamant both he and Parish are “100 per cent committed” to a strong finish to the campaign, believes the situation around wantaway striker Jean-Philippe Mateta is “very clear”.",
      "He added: “He didn’t hand in a transfer request and we have no bid received right now. That is the situation.” But pressed as to whether or not he had informally spoken to the France international about a move away, Glasner would only say: “I speak with many players about different topics, but I think what they deserve is that I don’t tell it publicly.”",
      "Glasner likened the past week to a “thunderstorm” but predicted a brighter forecast, particularly with the returns of Ismaila Sarr, back in the squad after winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, and a healthy Daniel Munoz. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson will captain Palace for the remainder of the season, including Sunday’s meeting with Chelsea at Selhurst Park.",

      "Sikou Niakate has shed light on his peculiar reason for halting his football career(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "A filmmaker abandoned his boyhood dream of a football career due to fears about the size of his penis. Sikou Niakate, 34, grew up playing football in Paris and idolising Sir Alex Ferguson 's Manchester United sides.",
      "He aspired to emulate David Beckham and Patrice Evra at Old Trafford, showing promise and even drew comparisons to Manchester City legend Yaya Toure due to his tall frame and style of play. However, Niakate has now revealed how he let go of his dreams of joining a football club because he felt embarrassment about his private parts.",
      "In a fascinating new documentary titled 'Dans le noir, les hommes pleurent' (In the Dark, Men Cry), which addresses issues of masculinity and is available on YouTube, the director recounts two distressing incidents from his youth that fuelled his fear of ever changing in a dressing room. The prospect of communal showering quickly became unthinkable, ending his dreams of a career in football.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, he said: “As a child, I only wanted one thing: to become a footballer. I dreamed of Manchester United, the red shirt, the number 7, David Beckham, and Patrice Evra. I gave everything for it. I played football for at least three hours a day. I was good. Excellent, even. I played midfield, sometimes as a number 10. I was tall, very tall. In middle school, I was already 1.92 m. I was technically gifted. Really technically gifted. Which is rare for a tall guy.",
      "“I had better passing accuracy than all the guys I played with; I was even the one who crossed the ball, even though I was the tallest, because I was so precise. I was a bit like Yaya Touré. I was playing in my neighbourhood, in Paris, in the 19th arrondissement. Naturally, the question of joining a club came up. But that would have meant accepting the idea of communal showers, and for me, that was unthinkable. Impossible. What I was hiding would become visible.”",
      "He had dreams of playing for Manchester United(Image: Wolves via Getty Images)",
      "He explained: “When I was little, one day, I was getting ready to shower while my sister was cleaning the bathroom. We started bickering, she got angry and said to me, laughing, 'With your tiny little d***.' When she said that, those words pierced me, they killed me. I thought I wasn't normal, that my body wasn't beautiful, and that I was going to have to hide it.",
      "“Later, after a football match, one of my friends showed me his penis, for no reason, just as a joke, and asked me to show him mine. His penis was much bigger and I didn't want to. He kept pressuring me, insisting it was weird that I said no. I had no choice. I pulled down my sweatpants and underwear. He looked, held back a laugh, then exploded: 'You have a tiny little d***, it's crazy.'",
      "“I was dying inside. I walked behind him, looking at the ground, head down. I'm a monster. So I decided never to play club football. Never, ever. So maybe when I did play, I was twice as good because I was compensating for not being able to play on a team. I'm not saying I had the talent for a huge career, but I think I could have played for a club, even a good one. But showing myself naked wasn't an option.",
      "Sikou Niakate was ridiculed for his penis size(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "He couldn't step into a communal shower(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "“I talk about the importance of penis size in my documentary, 'In the Dark, Men Cry'. And with all the feedback I received, I realised it affects a huge number of men. It's called 'the locker room syndrome.'",
      "“I used to think I was the only one whose mind was constantly saying, 'How embarrassing to have this body!' It never left me. In middle school, in PE, I always scored between 17 and 20, but when it came to swimming, I got a zero. I never went. It would have meant wearing a swimsuit that would cling to my crotch. Wearing a swimsuit in the shower? Forget about it!",
      "“If I played basketball in a club, it was because I could implement a strategy. I was in a hospitality school at the time. To avoid having to change in the communal locker room, I would explain that I couldn't be there earlier because of my classes and I would arrive after practice had started, still wearing my school suit. On game days, at worst, I had to take off a pair of pants, quickly put on shorts, turn around, talk, create a diversion, but the communal shower was out of the question.",
      "He claimed to play like Yaya Toure [pictured](Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I am aware that penis size has taken on an irrational importance in my life. It's my inner war. Very early on, I told myself, 'I'm finished.' As a child, I looked at my body with profound dislike but I kept telling myself, 'It'll change when I grow up.' I had this utopian vision. After a while, I realised that this body had a taste of permanence, so that utopian vision died and that's when I went very far. I told myself that I absolutely had to change. I researched surgeries and so on.",
      "“I feel like I've been punished by the genetic lottery, like I'm failing in my duty as a man and it shapes every aspect of my life. Obviously, it's excessive; I've seen with my partners how it wasn't an obstacle to pleasure, or even a topic of discussion, that they didn't perceive it the way I did. They would say, 'What are you talking about?' Probably, as a black man, I also thought that my normality had to be excess, that I couldn't just conform to the French norm. I imagine that can fuel a distorted view of oneself.",
      "“Things have gotten better since I've allowed myself to experience some shared intimacy, something that was unthinkable for a long time. But while the public self, the clothed self, is very comfortable, the naked self is much less so.”",

      "Michael Carrick has yet to add to his Manchester United squad in January(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Arsenal and Manchester United are set to face off in the Premier League this weekend, with the Red Devils eager to showcase continued progress under new manager Michael Carrick.",
      "Arsenal currently sit above United in both the league standings and underlying performance metrics, and they also hold the recent advantage in this fixture, having won the last two league meetings between the sides. Recent form further highlights this gap: Arsenal are unbeaten in their last six matches, recording four wins and two draws, while United have managed two wins, three draws, and one defeat over the same period.",
      "The Gunners are enjoying an impressive unbeaten streak, now stretching to 12 matches with ten victories and two draws. Their home form has been especially formidable, as Mikel Arteta’s men have not lost at the Emirates since May 2025, when Bournemouth claimed a 2-1 win. Defensively, Arsenal have been rock-solid on home soil, ranking among the league’s best for clean sheets and conceding very few goals at the Emirates. Their matches also feature one of the lowest \"both teams to score\" percentages in the division.",
      "Manchester United, on the other hand, arrive with just one win in their last five outings. That victory, however, was a significant one: in Michael Carrick’s managerial debut, United defeated rivals Manchester City 2-0 in a commanding display. While this result offers hope of a new era at Old Trafford, Arsenal’s dominance—especially at home—presents a daunting challenge that may be too great for even an improved United side to overcome.",
      "With Carrick at the helm, United’s recent results may not fully reflect the team’s current trajectory, as the tactical setup has shifted since his arrival. In their last five matches, United have seen both teams score in four games, while only two have featured over 2.5 goals, suggesting a more disciplined defensive approach compared to earlier in the season.",
      "Overall, while Manchester United may be on the rise under new management, Arsenal’s consistency and strength at the Emirates make them firm favourites heading into this weekend’s clash.",
      "Mikel Arteta faces a potential selection headache ahead of this tricky home fixture: should he start Viktor Gyokeres or Gabriel Jesus up front? The likelihood is that Gyokeres will get the nod at the Emirates, as Jesus logged more minutes in midweek against Milan—though he did find the net twice, compared to the Swedish striker’s single goal off the bench. Until recently, Jesus had been limited to substitute appearances as he worked his way back from an ACL injury, but he’s quickly closing the gap on Gyokeres’s goal tally despite having played around 1,400 fewer minutes across the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "On the injury front, Riccardo Calafiori, Piero Hincapie, and Max Dowman were all absent from Tuesday night’s squad, casting serious doubt over their availability for the weekend.",
      "For the visitors, Michael Carrick may opt to stick with the same starting XI that secured a statement win over Manchester City last Saturday. Noussair Mazraoui is back in the fold following his Africa Cup of Nations campaign, but the match is likely to come too soon for the injured Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee. As a result, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez are expected to continue as the central defensive pairing, unless Carrick decides to give youngsters Leny Yoro or Ayden Heaven a chance on this big stage. At left-back, Luke Shaw should retain his spot unless Patrick Dorgu—who has impressed as an attacking midfielder recently, including in the last match—returns to his former defensive role.",

      "Chido Obi scored against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Brown told Football Insider:",
      "Martinez will definitely be one to watch for Man United. Lammens has done well since coming in, I think he's looked solid and reliable, but they could do with a real top-class goalkeeper in there. Martinez certainly fits that bill. I think he's still one of the best in the world when he's at the top of his game, and he would certainly be an improvement.",
      "So if Villa are going to be willing to let him go, then they'd be silly not to consider it at least. They wanted him in the summer, and nothing has changed since then. If he's available and the price isn't too much for them to afford, I would be surprised if they didn't make a move."

He always resolved to keep going and to bounce back, no matter how tough things got.",
      "The fact that he will leave the club as a fixture in the first team is evidence of that. He won his place back through hard work, and on Saturday he was the outstanding player on the pitch in a Manchester derby. His celebrations were enthusiastic, leaping on Michael Carrick's back at one stage after being subbed and embracing with Lisandro Martinez after running onto the pitch as they celebrated Mason Mount's goal before it was disallowed.",
      "Casemiro endured a difficult night at Crystal Palace in May 2024(Image: Zac Goodwin/PA Wire)",
      "He is a Brazilian import who won it all at Real Madrid, but he took to United as if he were a born-and-bred Mancunian. In an era when plenty of players find it difficult in Old Trafford's harsh glare, Casemiro was at home immediately. He \"massively cares\" about the club, as one source put it.",
      "There are plenty of positives around Casemiro, on and off the pitch. But it's hard to escape the astronomical cost associated with his time at Old Trafford. Signed from Real Madrid for an initial £60million in 2022 on that enormous salary, he came in during Erik ten Hag's first summer when the Dutchman had identified he had taken over a squad lacking character and personality.",
      "Casemiro had both. After watching his potential new employers lose 2-1 to Brighton and then 4-0 at Brentford in Ten Hag's first two games, he would have been forgiven for backing out. Instead, he picked up the phone to football director John Murtough after the second of those defeats and told him he still wanted to come and that he would fix it.",
      "For a while, he did. His standards were an example to everyone else in the squad. Described as an \"unbelievable professional\", he was always first in the gym for extra prep work and was respectful to everyone working at Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "One of Casemiro's senior teammates once told of the \"aura\" he carried in the dressing room. He wasn't a chest-beating leader but when he spoke, you listened. He didn't walk into the dressing room and lay his medals on the table, but he commanded instant respect.",
      "United fans quickly took a shine to Casemiro(Image: )",
      "Players were immediately impressed by his refusal to shirk a challenge, and his desire to stick up for teammates on the pitch helped unite a group that had been falling apart the previous season. His impact was immediate. United looked like they had found something under Ten Hag, and Casemiro was immense, never more so than in the Carabao Cup final in February 2023, when he celebrated like it was his first Champions League title.",
      "It's two Wembley trips that help understand Casemiro's time at the club. As good as he was in his first year, it came apart when he was exposed by Ten Hag's attempts to inject a more attacking approach, when games turned into basketball matches and the midfield was a barely patrolled zone.",
      "It reached a nadir that night at Crystal Palace, and a few weeks later, Casemiro was absent when United won the FA Cup against Manchester City. Ten Hag had said he wasn't fully fit going into the game, but named him on the bench, and he was on the official teamsheet. However, he then dropped out before United confirmed the team on social media, citing a tight hamstring in the dressing room.",
      "United pulled off a famous victory, but when Casemiro then left the after-party early, it looked like his days at the club were over. Had he not been on so much money, they would have been. He was on the market that summer, but there were no takers.",
      "That is why, despite Casemiro's many positives, it is impossible to ignore the financial aspect. When Sir Jim Ratcliffe was holding meetings ahead of his investment in the club, he cited the signing of the Brazilian as an example of United's transfer market waste, and that was in his first season when he was the apple of Old Trafford's eye.",
      "Casemiro celebrates a derby day goal on Saturday(Image: )",
      "That transfer fee paid to Real could have hit £70 million with add-ons, while his wages varied depending on whether United were in the Champions League. But it's fair to say the cost of four years of Casemiro is somewhere between £120million to £130million. You can kind of see Ratcliffe's point.",
      "But if United had more players of Casemiro's character and personality, with his standards and professionalism, then they might well be in a better place.",
      "He will almost certainly be in the starting XI at Arsenal on Sunday as he begins a farewell tour. You can also guarantee he will get a rapturous reception from the away end. He is a player who just got it at United and that endeared him to the supporters from the off.",
      "By the time he leaves, he will have clocked up around 160 games, but his Old Trafford career has been more eventful than most. The highs were high, but the lows were despairing. He will be missed by fans and teammates alike.",
      "He won't be missed on the balance sheet, but then United haven't tried to replace him yet.",

      "Michael Carrick has spoken to Casemiro this week after he confirmed he is leaving Manchester United(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick revealed Casemiro is \"desperate\" to finish on a high at Manchester United after the midfielder confirmed he will leave the club at the end of this season. United confirmed the Brazilian will depart when his contract expires in the summer, with the announcement made on Thursday to provide clarity on his future.",
      "That allows Casemiro time to assess his options over his next move, but Carrick insists his commitment cannot be questioned. Confirmation of his exit after four years at the club comes just days after he produced an outstanding performance in the Manchester derby.",
      "Casemiro again showed his passion for the club with some jubilant celebrations in the Old Trafford victory against City and he is likely to keep his place in the side for the trip to Arsenal this weekend. Although United have only the Premier League to focus on for the remainder of the season, Casemiro can play a part in returning them to the Champions League and Carrick has held talks with him this week about leaving on a positive note.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I think the announcement for Case was for clarity as much as anything, it was decided anyway before I arrived so it's not just a knee-jerk kind of decision,\" said the United head coach.",
      "\"The type of personality, the character that he is, I think it shows with his performance last week, where he is mentally and how much it means for him to be here and to finish this season strong. I've already had that conversation with him and he's desperate to do well and finish well. It's good to see, so I've got no doubt about him at all.\"",
      "Harry Maguire is also out of contract at the end of this season and like Casemiro delivered an excellent display in the derby last weekend, returning to the starting XI after two months out with a thigh injury. His future isn't yet sealed and Carrick confirmed talks will be taking place over the next couple of months.",
      "\"I think that's just coming into that time of the season really with contracts. January is January in the window,\" he said. \"Coming towards the end of the season in terms of contracts and decisions and that will obviously be taken and discussed in good time really, and at the right time.\"",
      "Carrick did suggest he would offer his thoughts on Maguire's future, at least, with director of football Jason Wilcox set to take the lead on talks.",
      "\"I think the important thing for me is any decision I make or my staff make or the club make, it's not short-term, it's not just to get through to the end of the season,\" he said.",
      "\"I've got responsibility for whatever happens next to be in in a good place and moving forward to make the right decisions. So, as time goes on I'm sure I'll be part of it and we'll work our way through it.\"",

      "The 16-year-old, who is the eldest of the Rooney children, is treading a similar path to his famous father at United, having risen through the academy ranks after arriving at the club in 2009. Kai appeared at Old Trafford for the first time on Friday night, introduced from the bench during extra time as United's U-18 side edged past Derby U-18s with a 2-1 win in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup.",
      "Both Wayne and Coleen Rooney were seen among the spectators, even though the former England skipper has been officially 'banned' from attending Kai's matches because of the disruption his presence can cause.",
      "Supporters regularly crowd around Wayne seeking autographs and photos, which led Kai to ask his dad not to attend games in person so there would be fewer distractions on the touchline. \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen said back in 2024.",

      "Kai first played for United's U-18s in August of last year at just 15 years old. Appropriately, that match came against Everton, the club Wayne supported growing up. Since then, Kai has featured several times and caught the eye, especially given he is among the youngest in his squad.",

When Kai entered the field, a crowd of just over 2,000 fans welcomed him with chants of \"Rooney, Rooney.\"",
      "Although Kai is forging his own journey, it is worth noting that Wayne had already made headlines at Everton by that age, memorably scoring from distance against Arsenal to become one of the Premier League's youngest-ever goalscorers.",

However, United had covered the costs of Amass' loan to facilitate game time, which opened the door for Norwich to make an improved offer to sign him and while United were happy to send Amass back to South Yorkshire, the decision has been made to continue his development at Carrow Road.",

      "Brooklyn Peltz Beckham has been supported by his former youth football coach, who disclosed he observed some \"bizarre carry on\" and a \"strange dynamic\" during the explosive family rift. The high-profile dispute intensified this week as Brooklyn sided with his wife while criticising Sir David Beckham and Victoria Beckham in a dramatic development.",
      "The 26-year-old released an incendiary statement condemning his parents, David and Victoria, declaring he \"does not want to reconcile\" with them. Brooklyn attacked his family by claiming they had leaked stories about him to the media, while a divide emerged around his wedding to wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham.",
      "Among the most controversial revelations in the statement was Brooklyn's accusation against his mother, Victoria, 51, alleging she \"hijacked\" his first dance with Nicola and was \"dancing inappropriately on\" him before their 500 wedding guests.",
      "He remains the sole family member to publicly share his perspective on the messy dispute, with sources telling The Mirror he has 'no regrets' about going public.",
      "As the family conflict has been thrust into the public eye, a former football coach of Brooklyn's - from his adolescent years - has shed light on what he observed regarding their family relationships. Brooklyn had been training with Queens Park Rangers in 2013, aged just 14, whilst pursuing a career in professional football.",

      "During this period, he trained under Anthony McCool, a former academy coach at the west London club, who has also worked in scouting roles.",
      "Amid all the controversy surrounding Brooklyn and his family breakdown, former QPR coach Anthony McCool turned to LinkedIn to share his own observations of the Beckham family dynamics. He wrote: \"Brooklyn Beckham getting piled on. But I felt sorry for the lad.",
      "\"I did see some bizarre carry on as his football coach at QPR and [I have] certainly seen the anxiety.",
      "\"He might have got this situation wrong, I'm not on either side because I don't know them and his parents were always polite to me. But I did witness myself a strange dynamic which is impossible for us to judge and predict how we would navigate it, both as parents and as a young person.",

      "\"But this spell was on another serious level. \"Hijacking\" - it would make a good chapter in my book. What it did do was open my eyes. Being super wealthy and famous isn't an automatic ticket to happiness.",
      "\"It's hard to 'sympathise' or empathise because most of us will never know. But being flanked by permanent security at 14, plus the many other things I seen made me realise I shouldn't judge because I haven't walked a mile in them shoes, or his parents to be fair.",
      "\"I am sure they will close ranks and resolve their differences. I hope so. (and David, thanks for paying me back that £6).\"",

      "Oliver Glasner launched a stunning attack on his Crystal Palace bosses as he prepares to leave Selhurst Park(Image: )",
      "Having just got rid of one combustible head coach who rarely sticks to the script in public, Manchester United won't be rushing to appoint another. That's why Oliver Glasner's remarkable rant against his Crystal Palace bosses after defeat at Sunderland on Saturday was such a risk.",
      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.",
      "\"I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once. Now it happens twice in six or seven months. That's just where we are now.\"",
      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have sold Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January(Image: )",
      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Manchester United travel to Arsenal on Sunday looking to continue their good performance vs Manchester City(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may as well have been lauded as a tactical genius after Manchester United produced a performance which shocked the Premier League to beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. On another day, had it not been for marginal offsides and some incredible reflex stops by Gianluigi Donnarumma, it could have been more.",
      "But United fans are not greedy, particularly after a performance that inspiring, and the hope is there that they can continue this form as they push for a spot in the top four. The game plan Carrick implemented against City was not expected considering how he liked his Middlesbrough team to dominate the ball in the Championship.",
      "However, he was pragmatic and had confidence his defence could keep out City's threats and hit them on the counter attack. This tactic worked to perfection. Senne Lammens made one ill-advised save for a shot that was going well off target but otherwise, had nothing to do.",
      "Meanwhile, at the other end, the Reds had ten shots, seven of which were on target. It was a case of quality over quantity and all of this came from just 32 per cent possession. The beauty of Carrick's game plan was how positive it was without the need to dominate the ball.",
      "United were patient, picked their moments and deserved the victory. While this game plan will need changing for matches against teams who the Reds, on paper, should be dominant over, they can copy and paste it for the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At Nottingham Forest this weekend, Arsenal had 60 per cent possession and tried their best to break down their opponents only to settle for a point. United sitting deep and then playing with pace on the break is arguably their best chance of stopping the runaway leaders.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be mindful of this but it is one thing knowing what is about to come, and another thing stopping it. However, what United need to be wary of, which they did not have to concern themselves with against City, is the Gunners' threat from set pieces.",
      "All the way back on the opening day of the season, United managed to hold their own against the north London club only to be caught out by a corner. There were suspicions of a foul which were waved away but Altay Bayindir was not strong enough and the goal was a poor one to concede.",
      "Last season, United were atrocious when it came to defending set pieces but they have managed to make some progress in the 2025/26 season. Lammens seems more commanding in the area and as a result, goals being conceded in this manner have dropped.",
      "But Arsenal are the specialists and you would expect this week, Carrick will be drilling in the importance of being alert at all times and how each set piece routine is a huge threat. The Gunners have the best squad in the Premier League and they are also a more physical side to most.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are wrecking balls at corners and United need to stand up and be counted. That is why you would expect Harry Maguire to start thanks to his aerial abilities.",
      "United have been accused of having a soft underbelly in the past but if they can replicate what they did against City at the Emirates Stadium, they will banish those criticisms.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Lisandro Martinez(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Incredibly, after one of the most impressive Manchester United performances in some time, the main sub-plot coming out of the Manchester derby is a rift between Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Lisandro Martinez. In the build-up to the derby, the former United midfielders gave a scathing critique of the Argentine on their podcast - The Good, The Bad and The Football.",
      "\"Martinez against [Erling] Haaland,\" Scholes said before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” The legendary midfielder added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "It was an outburst which raised eyebrows among the United fanbase as their comments went beyond normal punditry criticism, towards, at best, immature teasing of a professional footballer. Fittingly, Martinez started and impressed at Old Trafford on Saturday as he helped keep the Norwegian quiet, including producing a timely block to stop the striker.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With a 2-0 victory under their belt, it seemed the matter had been put to rest until the Argentine spoke in the mixed zone afterwards. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Scholes was quick to respond. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar please Lisandro Martinez.\" For now, that is where the back and forth ends but the whole saga has threatened to overshadow what was a brilliant victory in Michael Carrick's return fixture.",
      "Martinez had every right to respond to Scholes after the victory over City and that result obviously empowered him to speak out. Scholes is also no stranger to ruffling a few feathers with his takes.",
      "Back in December, he branded Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo as 'b*******' while Butt and Scholes agreed they would advise him to leave United if he to asked their opinion. Pundits should never be mere mouthpieces for the clubs they used to play for.",
      "But some pundits and ex United players are not holding back. Gary Neville was cited by Amorim over claims his criticism was influencing the club's decision makers while Roy Keane was scathing about the appointment of Jonny Evans to the backroom staff and took a pot-shot at Carrick's wife on the Stick to Football podcast after a social media spat during the midfielder's playing days.",
      "In an age where outrage sells, especially on social media, it is unsurprising to see punditry comments become a bit clos to the bone. Martinez and other United players should also be encouraged to respond to it, if they see fit.",
      "But, Martinez and his teammates are only in their right to respond if they are happy to hold their hands up when things are not going as well. It is telling when United win a match, social media is awash with posts from the squad celebrating and thanking the fans.",
      "Yet, when they lose, apologies are few and far between. Perhaps this is partly down to PRs advising their clients to keep quiet but it does come across as disingenuous to seemingly only comment after a win.",
      "Now that both men have had their say, it is time for a line to be drawn underneath this saga and for Martinez to continue doing his talking on the pitch. If he continues to perform well, the critics will have little reason to speak out.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

We’ll probably see Gnarls Barkley in a Villa shirt before Ross. Bogarde and Hemmings are very useful defensive mids, but both are young enough to think the Makelele Role is a Frederick Forsyth novel (obviously Frederick Forsyth novels are massive with Gen Z). Tielemans, Son of Unai, is more than happy trying to do too much a la Bruno Fernandes/Victoria Beckham, but if he gets injured we are proper screwed. So the midfield is *stretched*.",
      "But the main thing with Kamara is: our record with him vs without is pretty stark. The last time we lost a prem game with him in the team was Liverpool away on 1 November; otherwise, with him in the team we’ve played 6 other games against Big 6 teams and won 6. (And Wolves, which may not seem much but it has been hard work for us over the years, including this season until Bouba banged in a Rogers special).",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played five or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games. Could do little to stop either of Sunderland’s goals.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves before a very creditable clean sheet at Villa.",
      "",
      "Burnley are in the mire but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 22 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo. And dropped a bollock against Everton.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad. Little he could do in the face of Carrick-ball.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal. A first clean sheet in five against Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4. And flapping at the corner that led to West Ham’s winner was a dreadful look.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and had very little to do against Palace and Wolves either side of a madness against Leeds.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so but Big John fluffed his big chance.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save at Fulham and only one against Burnley from his own defender.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri was back in. Briefly, as it turned out. Darlow took the gloves again for a serene outing against Fulham.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",

      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Unsurprisingly dropped when Fulham came to Elland Road.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save. Newcastle gave him little more to do.",

      "The Red Devils moved up to fifth in the Premier League but remain 15 points behind Arsenal, who are the current leaders, with Mikel Arteta’s side seven points ahead of nearest rivals Man City and Aston Villa.",
      "Man Utd travel to the Emirates Stadium over the weekend in a much different test with Arsenal losing just two matches all season, both away from home.",
      "And Merson is expecting a very comfortable victory for Arsenal despite Carrick’s impressive victory over City in his first fixture.",

      "“Viktor Gyokeres and Gabriel Jesus scoring against Inter is great news for Arsenal. I think Gyokeres needs to come off the bench in the next few games. When the defenders are tired, the game will open up for him and he can make an impact. So it’s better if he comes on for the final 20 minutes.",

      "“If you told me I had to bet on one team to win this weekend, I’d actually go Arsenal. Everything points to a win for Mikel Arteta’s men here. They are just so good at home. 29 points from 11 games at the Emirates. Even when they looked so bad against Liverpool, they did not lose.",

      "We could (quite fairly) be accused of erring on the side of negativity here at Football365. We revel in the rubbish and are often guilty of failing to bask in the brilliance we see on a regular basis in the Premier League.",
      "We’ve selected the most overrated players, the very worst player at each club and enjoy calling out big-money signings for an entirely reasonable struggle to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "But sometimes it’s nice to be nice, and so here are the revelations of the season, the players who have surprised us with their excellence – one per club.",
      "",
      "He must have been cursing his misfortune upon his arrival last season when Myles Lewis-Skelly enjoyed one of the most stratospheric rises to prominence in recent memory, to such a degree that Calafiori was linked with an exit in the summer, 12 months on from his arrival for £42m.",
      "But he’s made the left-back position in his own in the Premier League this term, combining near faultless defensive displays with no small amount of attacking threat. Being a big lad certainly hasn’t hurt him in his successful usurping of the academy star.",
      "",
      "An honourable mention for the Lazarus of the West Midlands, Matty Cash, who we thought was finished but has played nearly every minute under Unai Emery this term, scoring in the victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. But the new level Rogers has found this season gives him the edge; his knuckleball deserves its own section.",
      "Jude Bellingham or Rogers for England? Could genuinely be a toss-up.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ graded by football analysis experts Gradient Sports",
      "Seven Premier League goals in 646 minutes for the teenager, who’s got the best minutes per goal rate (92.3) of any player in the top flight this season, with Erling Haaland (95) second. The ‘New Kylian Mbappe’ tag doesn’t seem quite so silly now.",
      "",
      "Sixteen goals is at least 14 more goals than we expected from the £30m summer signing who scored 18 in what must actually be The Best League In The World for Club Brugge in 2023/24.",
      "",
      "His ability to thread passes through opposition teams is arguably unmatched in the Premier League and he also loves a battle with a centre-forward, as Haaland found out earlier this month. Quite weird that there’s not more interest in his service from the Big Six vultures. Surely only a matter of time.",
      "",
      "Eight goals in the Championship last season, Anthony’s already got five in the Premier League, including home and away against Manchester United and at the Etihad vs Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Him being fit is a revelation in itself but the way in which he’s developed as a central midfielder has also been remarkable. That move from right-back – which we questioned like many others – may end up being Enzo Maresca’s most crucial and enduring Chelsea legacy. His performance against Arsenal in that role was extraordinary.",
      "",
      "His level has dropped along with the rest of his teammates of late, but the 29-year-old put in several hugely impressive all-round displays when it was still worth getting up in the morning at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Few would have predicted Garner as Xavi Simons’ answer to a question about which Premier League player has surprised him most – “technical with the ball, he’s really, really good” – or that midway through the season we would be seeing a (bit of a) clamour for him to be called up by Thomas Tuchel for England amid questions as to whether Manchester United should re-sign him as an answer to the midfield conundrum.",
      "",
      "Surely the biggest Premier League revelation of all with his eight goals and five assists for Fulham. And he so very nearly made a deadline-day move to Leeds – a private jet was pre-emptively booked before talks broke down.",
      "",
      "Nine Premier League goals, eight of which have come in a run of nine games after Daniel Farke changed formation to stick another striker up top with him. The England clamour is real.",
      "",
      "Slim picking it’s fair to say but 12 goals in all competitions is a decent return for a striker most of us assumed wouldn’t get much of a look in this season.",
      "",
      "We assumed he was destined to be one of those ten-a-penny wingers who get close to the top by being very, very quick but not quite having it in the top two inches, but he’s developed his game to the point where he doesn’t just look like he could and should make the difference but actually does.",
      "",
      "There’s life in the old dog yet as this particular old dog is evidently desperate to represent his country at the World Cup, before seeing out his days lying balls-up on the sofa, only rising from his slumber for meals and to curl the occasional one out in the back garden, probably in Saudi Arabia.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe described Kieran Trippier’s “spontaneous” decision to hand Miley the armband for the final few minutes of their clash with PSV on Wednesday as “poignant” and also quite possibly a sign of what’s to come, dubbing the 19-year-old a “potential future captain of the football club”.",
      "There was a time – maybe even only a few weeks ago – when an injury to Bruno Guimaraes would have been an utter disaster for Newcastle. But the outstanding versatility and quality shown by Miley this season makes his absence feel manageable at the very least.",
      "",
      "You pal down the pub claiming they always knew Anderson would emerge as the answer to that age-old England problem is almost certainly telling porky pies. His Transfermarkt valuation has nearly doubled from £28m to £52m this season and that’s likely around half of what Manchester City will pay for his services after he conducts England to World Cup glory in the summer.",
      "",
      "There are few things we like more than a Premier League giant selling an academy star to a lower-league team before they return to the top flight to rub the mistake in their face. It’s a shame for us vengeance seekers that Ballard’s boyhood club Arsenal might be the only Premier League side he wouldn’t start for based on his outstanding form this season.",
      "",
      "He does next-to-nothing to help his side keep hold of the ball or get up the pitch, which is entirely as expected, but has also scored seven Premier League goals when we assumed he would be fortunate to score any as a bit-part player before escaping in January.",
      "",
      "We liked what we saw of him for Southampton last season, but it takes quite some mental fortitude not to crumble in this West Ham team, playing in that stadium, in front of those fans. Two relegations in two seasons won’t feel great, but Real Madrid interest in triggering his not-so-secret £20m release clause will.",
      "",
      "The only positive Wolves can take away from this season and the fans will if anything not want him to display too much more of his burgeoning talent for the rest of the campaign, lest he be pinched by a club set to still be playing Premier League football next term.",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy has explained why he thinks only one team is capable of stopping Arsenal winning the Champions League this season.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid have issued an ‘ultimatum’ to Vinicius Junior, while president Florentino Perez ‘wants’ to sign a Manchester City star.",
      "Emiliano Buendia struck a huge blow for Aston Villa and granted us all a genuine title race as Unai Emery’s side exposed Arsenal and two Gunners in particular.",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves insists Premier League leaders Arsenal have the “four best full-backs in the country”.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly already decided whether they will enter the market for a new signing in January after suffering a ‘shattering injury blow’.",
      "We’re ruling Liverpool out of the title race after that abject defeat at Man City, who are definitely not out of it after cutting Arsenal’s lead to four."

      "The Red Devils sacked Ruben Amorim a fortnight ago as they looked to turn around their results and performances this season.",
      "After Darren Fletcher had taken the next two matches, Man Utd appointed Carrick as their interim boss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Man Utd made an incredible start under Carrick by beating arch-rivals Man City 2-0 but the scoreline could have been even more impressive for the Red Devils.",
      "The Red Devils will decide on a permanent replacement for Amorim at the end of the season with numerous managers linked to the job in the summer.",

      "READ: Paul Scholes should ‘f**king grow up’ as shock four-man Manchester United midfielder shortlist ‘revealed’",
      "Ornstein revealed in conversation with Duncan Castles on The Transfers Podcast: “Carrick will naturally enter the conversation depending on how well he does. But I don’t think this is binary, as it was with Ole Gunner Solskjaer. United should run their process properly: speak to available coaches, assess those in work where permitted, look at data, styles and profiles.",
      "“Last time, it came down to Thomas Tuchel and Erik ten Hag. Others like Frank and Pochettino were considered. There are weeks and months now to do that work. Carrick could play himself into contention, or he might decide it’s not the right moment.",
      "“There’s nothing firm right now. It’s hypothetical. But given his qualities, what he showed in his brief United spell before, and his work at Middlesbrough, there’s no reason he shouldn’t at least be in the conversation – much like Kieran McKenna was previously.",
      "“Carrick could be in the mix, but that doesn’t mean he’ll get the job. It’s very much a case of wait and see how it unfolds.”",
      "And Ornstein thinks Carrick ticks one crucial box for the Man Utd hierarchy as they look to bring in the right man to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "Ornstein added: “I also understand why United went for a figure with a connection to the club. Lifting spirits, restoring smiles and confidence matters, even if it sounds trite. It’s not everything, but it helps.",
      "“A lot has lifted off the club since the change. That’s no disrespect to Amorim, who I think will go on to have an excellent career.”",

      "Michael Carrick is the interim manager of Manchester United but will he be in charge next season?",

      "But we start with the story that just will not die despite one side keeping their counsel.",
      "Big fan of Paul Scholes discussing his ongoing and almost entirely one-sided feud with Lisandro Martinez on The Overlap and admitting that “what we said probably wasn’t great”, “the way we described it probably wasn’t great and we probably shouldn’t have done that”, and “I can see why he was offended by it and we probably worded it not in a great way”.",
      "But also at the same time saying he’s not going to apologise, and again emphasising the “mismatch” between Martinez and Haaland (who has now only scored in one of his six games against Martinez).",
      "A couple of points:",
      "1) Is it still Martinez who needs to “f**king grow up”?",
      "2) Is anyone going to tell Scholes or Butt to stop talking about it, or is that advice preserved only for the footballer who responded to one journalist’s question and has remained silent since on both social media and the world’s many billion podcasts?",

      "If something else happened, the reaction would not be the same. Yes. That is a true thing to have said, Joleon. You are correct. But the professional dynamic is ever so slightly different and whatever problems there were to address – it cannot be stressed enough just how completely unperturbed Tielemans was by Emery’s actions because he is presumably used to this kind of thing – were sorted in the dressing room by all accounts.",
      "Again, yes. If Tielemans had responded by curling one out on the Fenerbahce pitch then it would be a big problem and there would be uproar. It would certainly have overshadowed the game in a way Emery’s push absolutely did not.",

      "In my view, much has been made of Arsenal’s reliance on set pieces this season, as evidence of a limited / pragmatic / neanderthal approach (take your pick). I think this misunderstands both the cause and the context.",
      "For the last decade and a half, elite football was dominated by positional, ball-heavy systems (70% possession, extreme technical prowess, territory control, cut-backs from the edge of the box) perfected by Guardiola’s genius. The natural response to that dominance for teams with lesser (but not insignificant) resources was resistance: better-coached mid-blocks, aggressive man-marking, and sophisticated rest-defence structures, especially among mid-table PL sides (who, remember, have more money and thus better players – not comparable to the best teams tactically, but fit for purpose of the type of game they planned to play).",
      "In other words, the league got better at stopping positional football.",
      "That tactical shift reduced open-play volume for everyone, including Arsenal (remember the fluent team of 22-23). Set pieces, IMO, are not the cause of this evolution but a rational response to it. Arsenal and a few others (notably Chelsea) have leaned into them because they are one of the few remaining repeatable advantages against compact, well-drilled defences.",
      "Arteta’s use of set pieces, to me, looks less like dogma and more like a stopgap i.e. an efficient (if not aesthetic) solution while the next attacking evolution is being worked out. Guardiola, interestingly, has not yet leaned into that lever to the same extent. His old road’s rapidly agin’, but if anyone can come up with an elegant solution, it’s him.",
      "The broader point is this: set-piece dominance is not evidence of regression. It is evidence of adaptation in a league where defensive organisation has finally caught up with positional purity (and I would say bettered it). A more elegant attacking solution will emerge. It always does. But dismissing the current phase as ‘set-piece FC’ misses the tactical story entirely.",

The point of using Dynasty as a term was not that it was a direct alternative to ‘DNA’ but because DNA is being used so ephemerally, with no concrete concepts other than attacking and exciting (which any team could say they want and have had iterations of their team that have done that before), but that Dynasty implies a one-time event.  It doesn’t flow over to a later version of the team 10, 20 or more years later. Whether we like ‘Americanisations’ or not, it better reflects what happens for teams that dominate an era than DNA. Especially when it is trotted out, again, after one win. My other point was that the confidence that oozed through a team of round pegs in round holes was far more instrumental in the win than DNA.",

      "A fun thing about this weekend is that it’s the return fixtures from the opening game of the season. It’s just nice to see how different teams’ seasons have panned out and what clues or misdirections were evident back in the sunny days of August.",
      "At Old Trafford on the first Super Sunday of the season, Arsenal ran out slightly fortunate 1-0 winners in a game that prompted significant outpourings of optimism from home supporters despite the result.",
      "Arsenal, meanwhile, offered only unconvincing early evidence that this could at long last be their season, and Viktor Gyokeres looked like he might be a dud.",
      "It soon became clear that Man United were still quite cack, and that it was in fact Arsenal’s season. Good call on Gyokeres, though, who is truly Dud of Dud Hall.",
      "Ruben Amorim has gone, of course, and Michael Carrick continues his gentle start to life as United’s latest sacrificial Fergie Boy by attempting to follow up last weekend’s Arsenal-assisting win over Man City with a Man City-assisting win over Arsenal.",
      "If he does it, they’ll probably give him the permanent job on the spot, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "More likely is that Arsenal win in rather more convincing fashion than they did at Old Trafford and it all takes a little while longer before Carrick manages to stumble home in fifth and claim a Champions League spot on the back of the effort of the teams who are actually in it this season. And then gets appointed to the permanent job, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "Arsenal will by that point have long been crowned champions, with the bald truth that there really doesn’t seem like there’s much anyone else in the division can do about it. The bigger question is how many other pots and pans they might take home.",
      "",
      "Let’s continue the theme of August reminiscences, because in few places would the contrast appear more initially stark than at Aston Villa.",
      "They began the season with a grim goalless draw against the Newcastle side that had pipped them to Champions League football on the final day of 24/25 in a game that very much continued the trending themes at the time for two clubs who had endured awkward and unsatisfactory summers.",
      "For Villa it would set a trend that would extend into September and a five-game winless run to start the season that didn’t even contain a goal until that fifth game.",
      "Then they just won pretty much all the games for an extended period of time to become brief yet genuine title contenders.",
      "But the reopening of the transfer window has brought back familiar doubts and truths, and despite Villa occupying an enviable position in the table and appearing certainties for Champions League football next season there is now once again a distinct sense of a buzz harshed.",
      "Frustration at rules that bind them while being more easily navigated by the established big clubs, of simply not being allowed to compete on even terms with Newcastle, never mind the cosseted Big Six. Even the stupidest members of that group are annoying Villa. Especially the stupidest members.",
      "A look at the table suggests this angst is misplaced; Villa remain closer to Arsenal than they do to fifth place, which will almost certainly be enough to achieve what Villa set out to achieve this season and which they looked a million miles away from doing back in August.",
      "But time and results and other factors all have a funny way of shifting those sands beneath your feet. And with a slight dip in results and the return of the transfer window with its now familiar frustrations, there’s just a nagging sense that Villa are neither as happy as they should be, nor as they were just a few short weeks ago.",
      "",
      "Liverpool’s wildly unconvincing yet improbably lengthy unbeaten run featured a rarity on Wednesday night, as a truly convincing performance put a dangerous Marseille side to the sword in a richly deserved 3-0 triumph.",
      "Liverpool impressed from front to back, while Arne Slot got pretty much everything right as well in dealing with an awkward and ever-shifting opponent.",
      "But perhaps the best thing about the night for Liverpool was that at the end of it almost nobody was talking about Mo Salah. He went straight into the starting line-up on his return from AFCON and had neither an eye-catchingly good nor poor game – there was one glaring late miss which he somehow contrived to send away from goal rather than towards it, but apart from that.",
      "Yet it didn’t ever really feel like it was of desperate importance. It would have seemed mad to think a month ago when Salah left for AFCON with his entire Liverpool future seemingly up in the air that his return six weeks later could be so low-key, such a footnote on a night of good news.",
      "His first Premier League appearance since December 13 is likely to attract more eyeballs and greater attention, though. We eagerly await to discover what kind.",
      "",
      "We now know for sure it’s when not if as far as Glasner’s Palace exit is concerned. Technically it’s not supposed to happen until the end of the season, but it feels absurd to suggest this now clearly broken marriage can stagger on that long. Especially if Palace continue on their current downward trajectory that sees them without a Premier League win in their last seven games and suffering the FA Cup’s biggest ever giant-killing.",
      "Carrying on doesn’t look like it’s going to do much good for either Palace or Glasner in the long run. Palace find themselves now slipping uncomfortably close to the fringes of relegation bother, while continuing with Palace for much longer could yet see Glasner play himself out of what currently looks like a near-certain shot at a Big Six job next season.",
      "It’s not inconceivable that four of that group could be seeking a new permanent manager in the summer, and Glasner is high in the lists for all of those jobs.",
      "But he won’t be if he spends the next three months angrily losing to everyone to prove his undeniably valid point about the lack of support he’s received.",

      "Boro have kept on keeping on, though, under Kim Hellberg and still firmly in the hunt for automatic promotion with the play-offs looking like a worst-case safety net.",
      "Preston are themselves still very much part of that picture, still just inside the top six going into this weekend despite consecutive defeats to Derby and Hull. This does feel like a pivotal spell of the season for their promotion hopes; after Boro comes another trip to a team eyeing an automatic return to the Premier League in Ipswich.",
      "",
      "Still an absurd amount of life left in the Serie A title race, where Inter now appear solid favourites but Roma down in fourth are still only seven points adrift and not without their chances.",
      "They surely can’t afford to slip 10 points off Inter’s pace and also fall seven points adrift of Milan this weekend, though. Victory over the team in second would lift them within a single point of Milan, which itself seems an oddity given Milan have lost one league game all season while Roma have already lost seven.",

      "The Real Madrid legend thrived in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has remained a key player since Michael Carrick took charge for the remainder of his United career.",

The offer being prepared in Riyadh surpasses any known standard, both in salary and media impact.",
      "‘Al Hilal wants Bruno to be the face of their international project, a symbolic signing that would reinforce the Saudi league’s image as a destination for established stars. For the Portuguese player, the offer would be virtually impossible to refuse from a financial standpoint, placing him among a select few footballers in history.’",
      "It is also said that the final decision regarding Fernandes hinges on three ‘factors’; ‘the sporting project presented by Manchester United, Bayern Munich’s ability to entice him with their competitive offerings, and, above all, the size of the Saudi Arabian offer’.",

      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",
      "\"The feeling we've taken over the last week or two in the game and the training, The boys feel in a good place and are looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United in the summer. His estimated cost to the club £119m. The Athletic asks whether he was worth it",
      "By Mark Critchley, The Athletic",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 18:41, UK",
      "Spending at least £60m in transfer fees on a 30-year-old, giving him a salary of up to £350,000-per-week, and signing him to a four-year contract with the option of a further 12 months would not typically be viewed as cost-effective business.",
      "That is at least partly why Manchester United will not be triggering said option in Casemiro's contract. His Old Trafford career will instead come to an end this summer, as had long been expected.",
      "Once he says goodbye, after adding to his 146 appearances, many will hold up Casemiro's time in Manchester as another symbol of United's waste and extravagance in the transfer market, and a starry-eyed infatuation with big-name, big-money players who arrive well past their peak.",
      "There is undoubtedly some truth to that, but even if he may not have been a particularly smart signing, Casemiro was arguably a necessary one. And though four seasons of a five-time Champions League winner was never going to come cheap, it would also be unfair to dismiss him as a costly mistake.",
      "If anything, the cost was a symptom of United's desperation and dysfunction during Erik ten Hag's tumultuous first summer in charge, with his signing from Real Madrid being quickly accelerated after back-to-back defeats in their opening Premier League games.",
      "The long, protracted and painful pursuit of Frenkie de Jong had run aground by that point. Champions League qualification needed to be delivered at all costs.",
      "Ultimately, it was, thanks in no small part to Casemiro. For that first year in Manchester, certainly for the first six months of his Old Trafford career, he was considered a transformative addition.",
      "The arrival of one of the best No 6s of his generation finally addressed a longstanding problem at the base of midfield. Even if his age meant he was not going to be a long-term solution, his quality and experience meant he was a quick, effective fix.",
      "At his best for United, around the time of the Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle United that February, he was being uncontroversially hailed in some quarters as the club's most important signing since Eric Cantona.",
      "Casemiro's second season was much more of a struggle, though, and has coloured perceptions of his United career away from Old Trafford. On several occasions, he no longer looked capable of keeping up with the pace of the Premier League, and those stuck in the craw.",
      "Though far from the only player to have difficulties meeting the demands of Ten Hag's increasingly helter-skelter style of play, it did him absolutely no favours as a holding midfielder on the wrong side of 30 and exposed the short-termism of his signing.",
      "He didn't, though. And even after being cast to the peripheries by Ten Hag's successor, at one stage finding himself behind a 21-year-old Toby Collyer in the pecking order, his dedication and determination to win back his place led him to practically become an ever-present again. From then on, he was an example Ruben Amorim would constantly tell his other players to follow.",
      "Last week, The Athletic revealed that Casemiro's option would be automatically triggered if he started every remaining game this season. The chances of that were remote. Even if United had been open to another year, even if their shrinking budgets could afford it, injury or suspension would likely have got in the way. But on form alone, it was not such an outlandish prospect.",
      "Casemiro has started 19 of 24 matches in all competitions this season, including all but one of the Premier League games that he has been available for. Despite the justified clamour for Kobbie Mainoo to be given more opportunities, few argued that should come at the 33-year-old's expense.",
      "When part of more compact and conservative tactical setups than Ten Hag's, he has generally looked capable of continuing to play at a high level.",
      "His considerable threat from set pieces has left him with a respectable tally of 21 goals since joining. And though he could be erratic with his passing, there were often nights over the past three and a half years when he looked like the only United player other than Bruno Fernandes capable of creating something.",
      "Thursday's announcement that he will leave at the end of the season followed a man-of-the-match display in the 198th Manchester derby. It was only the latest example that Casemiro still has something to offer United, albeit not on his current pay packet.",
      "Even without the one-year option triggered, a rough estimate puts the minimum cost to United of first signing and then keeping Casemiro for the past four seasons at £119m ($160m). Was it worth it? Opinions will vary.",
      "But here's something more of us can agree on: United have been a better team when Casemiro is playing. This season, especially. And now, he must be replaced.",
      "There is a different set of decision-makers in place at Old Trafford compared to the summer of 2022, and they will surely look for a younger and more athletic midfielder, with a higher ceiling in terms of what they can achieve as a United player, and a higher resale value if they fall short of that mark. A smarter signing, we'll all surely agree.",
      "Like Casemiro, that midfielder - whether it is Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or another target - won't come cheap. And to avoid any sort of drop-off next season, they will need to be as dependable at the base of United's midfield as the man they are replacing has been for most of his eventful Old Trafford career.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has 18 months remaining on his Manchester United contract, plus the option of a further year; 20-year-old did not start a Premier League game this season under Ruben Amorim but was restored to the XI in Michael Carrick's first game",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 11:58, UK",
      "On the day when United confirmed that one key midfielder will leave Old Trafford, with the soon-to-be-34-year-old Casemiro departing at the end of this season, it can now be revealed they are keen to tie down another, much younger, midfielder with a vastly improved deal.",
      "It is understood there has been initial contact with Mainoo's representatives, with a plan to sit down and discuss the details of a new and improved contract - one which would see his wages brought more in line with his team-mates and his standing at the club.",
      "Having come through United's academy, Mainoo's salary is among the smallest of all the members of the first-team squad. But with the 20-year-old not part of former head coach Ruben Amorim's plans, and with 18 months remaining on his current deal - plus a further year option - it was not seen as a priority for the club to open fresh talks.",
      "Mainoo did not start a single Premier League match this season under Amorim but was selected at the first opportunity by new head coach Michael Carrick last weekend as he put in an impressive performance as United beat City 2-0 in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"It's a significant time.",
      "\"On the day Manchester United announce Casemiro will be leaving the club at the end of the season, the club want to tie down another, much younger player in Mainoo, who they see as a key player for the future.",
      "\"It's a significant change for Mainoo.",
      "\"Under previous coach Ruben Amorim, he didn't start a single game this season.",
      "\"There was also interest in him in Europe but Michael Carrick has come in and he starred in the win over Manchester City.",
      "\"Manchester United now feel that this is the right time, while they are putting their house in order, they want to tie down some of their younger players who are important to the club's future. Mainoo is at the heart of it.\"",
      "The Mainoo news comes as Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season, ending a four-year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "As SSN previously reported in the autumn, Casemiro is one of the highest earners in the squad and it was unlikely United would renew his contract as the freed up wage capacity will allow more space for future investment/signings in the midfield area.",
      "Casemiro has had a renaissance at the club in the last 12 months. After being out of the team under Ruben Amorim initially, he was praised by Amorim for his willingness to fight for his place and has been a key part of the team since then - he started the Manchester derby under Michael Carrick in his first game as well.",
      "Looking ahead to the summer, Manchester United have an interest in the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.",
      "\"It's very interesting because we knew Casemiro's contract was running out this summer.",
      "\"Harry Maguire is also someone to talk about because his contract also runs out this summer. No fresh talks have happened with him, either.",
      "\"But especially with Casimiro, he is one of the highest earners at the club, and with that freed up wage space, we've been reporting in not just this window how Manchester United are targeting the summer to reinforce their midfield.",
      "\"We've already talked about the likes of Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace, Carlos Baleba at Brighton, Elliot Anderson and Nottingham Forest, to name a few.",
      "\"And through INEOS taking really control of the football operations, they've tried to change the way structures are streamlined a lot more.",
      "\"They're hoping that all of this capacity freed up can allow for more signings in the future, and with the midfield as a priority, it will mean that they definitely have to now sign someone in the summer.",
      "\"They'll only have Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, who looks like a new player under Michael Carrick, based on the Manchester derby.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes, now moving to No 10, they won't have many options in that position. INEOS will have to act quickly.\"",

      "🔴 Jesus over Gyokeres for Arsenal?💪 Miley's versatility for Newcastle🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres were seen to have given Mikel Arteta a selection dilemma against Manchester United in Arsenal's win over Inter Milan. But what if their goalscoring displays actually proved their suitability to their roles on the night?",
      "Arsenal looked a far more fluid attacking force with Jesus starting up front. The flurry of passes that led to their opening goal was untypical of Mikel Arteta's side this season and included a deft lay-off from Jesus to Mikel Merino before his instinctive finish.",
      "Jesus continued to knit things together, pulling to the flanks to combine with Arsenal's wide players, creating space for Eberechi Eze, feeding team-mates with his back to goal and, at one point, even driving forward with the ball and playing Bukayo Saka through.",
      "His performance, on only his third start this season, was reminiscent of the electrifying displays that followed his arrival from Manchester City in 2022, before the first in a succession of injuries struck.",
      "There was a set-piece goal too, of course, as he nodded his second over the line from a corner. But it was in open play that his impact was most apparent. Arsenal looked a different proposition thanks to their striker's imagination and technical security.",
      "They are qualities Gyokeres lacks. But by coming into the game as a substitute, when Inter were chasing an equaliser, he was able to show what he can do, attacking space on the break to latch onto Gabriel Martinelli's ball in behind before finishing superbly.",
      "It was a goal Jesus probably wouldn't have scored. Just as the opening goal by Jesus, with the intricate interplay that preceded it, was one Gyokeres probably wouldn't have scored.",
      "The first half of the season has exposed the limitations in Gyokeres's game. But it is also true that the conditions he found for his goal on Tuesday have rarely been available to him in the Premier League, where space is at a premium and compactness reigns.",
      "The moments when opponents become stretched tend to occur late in games, when they are tiring and, often, chasing goals. By that point, Gyokeres, who has started all but three of his 20 Premier League appearances so far, has usually been substituted.",
      "Arteta's hand has been forced, at least to some extent. Injuries to Jesus and Kai Havertz left Gyokeres as his only available striker for much of the season. But the option to change his role is there for the Arsenal manager now and the need for it is clear.",
      "Arsenal have won 13 out of 17 league games with Gyokeres starting but that is largely thanks to a reliance on set-pieces. They have only scored 13 open-play goals in those 17 games compared to 10 in the other five. There is a gap in open-play expected goals too.",
      "It is no coincidence that many of Arsenal's best and most fluent attacking performances this season, against Bayern Munich, Tottenham and now Inter Milan, have come when Arteta has started with either Mikel Merino or Jesus in the No 9 role over Gyokeres.",
      "Like Havertz, they bring more in the role. More touches, more passes, more duel-winning ability and, perhaps most damningly, more goals. Erling Haaland proves low-touch volume is not necessarily an issue for a striker. But only if that striker is scoring.",
      "Gyokeres, without a non-penalty Premier League goal since November 1, is simply not doing that. In his 17 starts up front in the competition, he has a worse shot conversion rate than any of the players with whom he is competing for the No 9 spot at Arsenal.",
      "All of which is not to say Gyokeres cannot be useful to Arteta. It might just require a recalibration of his role.",
      "At £64m, it is safe to assume he was not signed to be a substitute. But it is surely better to use him in the manner in which he can be most effective, as a relentless runner against tiring defences, than wait for him to become something he is not.",
      "Of course, the situation might look different had Havertz been available to share the minutes up front, instead of joining Jesus on the sidelines with a knee injury in August. A lighter workload, and more outings off the bench, might have suited Gyokeres better.",
      "It also would have made life easier for Arteta.",
      "Havertz's finishing has been a source of frustration to Arsenal supporters during his time at the club. But while the signing of Gyokeres was intended to add greater cutting edge, Havertz surely remains their first choice in the position when available.",
      "It is worth noting that at the time of the groin injury that curtailed his season last term, Havertz had scored 15 goals, putting him on track for the highest-scoring campaign of his club career.",
      "Across 31 Premier League starts as a forward for Arsenal overall, he has 24 goal involvements, with 15 goals and nine assists. And that is on top of everything else he brings to the role.",
      "They are hugely impressive numbers which underline the potential significance of a return to fitness which, frustratingly for Arsenal, is taking longer than expected. Havertz was an unused substitute against Nottingham Forest and Inter despite previously making cameos in the wins over Portsmouth and Chelsea.",
      "Jesus, of course, is still only recently returned from injury too.",
      "But if it is a choice between him or Gyokeres against Manchester United, events at the San Siro might have shown the way forward.",
      "The potential absence of Bruno Guimaraes against Aston Villa on Sunday following his injury against PSV Eindhoven is a worry for Newcastle. But in Lewis Miley they do at least have a player ready to step in and deliver whatever is asked of him.",
      "The 19-year-old ensured their captain was not missed in the second half of Wednesday's game. Having displayed maturity and composure in midfield, he ended up at right-back, taking the captain's armband off Kieran Trippier as he went off.",
      "It was a special moment for the academy product, who has been switching between positions all season. Having impressed as a makeshift right-back, he might now be needed back in midfield, where he has already slotted into a variety of different roles.",
      "Will Bryan Mbeumo be used as a No 9 again when Manchester United go to the Emirates Stadium on the back of their win in the Manchester derby? He can cause problems for the team against whom he made his United debut back in August.",
      "The last column made the case for Manchester United's new head coach Michael Carrick to go on the attack against Manchester City, something he did to great effect. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes's return to No 10 and Antoine Semenyo's impact.",

      "Florian Wirtz's start to life in the Premier League has been a slow burn - but the signs are starting to show that we must start paying attention to him across the prop markets.",
      "The early weeks after his £116m summer move from Leverkusen were awkward. New league, new tempo, new expectations. All that jazz.",
      "Wirtz's end product has caught fire recently though. He's now averaging close to a goal involvement every 102 minutes across his last eight appearances in all competitions.",
      "After failing to score in his first 22 Liverpool appearances, he's now hit the net in four of his last seven. That's a player finding rhythm, timing and trust in his surroundings.",
      "He is 8/1 to open the scoring with Sky Bet.",
      "Some bets don't need overcomplicating. You look at the venue, you look at the numbers and the picture becomes clear. Brentford at home is one of those situations and the 10/11 with Sky Bet against Nottingham Forest is very hard to turn down.",
      "The Gtech has quietly become one of the toughest places to go in the Premier League. Brentford have taken 24 points from a possible 33 at home, the fourth-best home record in the division. That's not built on soft fixtures either, it's a repeatable edge driven by structure, intensity and crowd energy.",
      "Brentford are aggressive in duels, strong in second balls and ruthless in moments that matter. They turn games into uncomfortable experiences for visiting teams.",
      "Oliver Glasner's impending departure at the end of the season matters. Even the most professional squads feel it when leadership has an expiry date. Messages lose a fraction of their bite. It doesn't mean Palace will down tools but it does mean focus can blur at the margins and at this level fine margins decide Premier League games.",
      "Chelsea, fresh from their own off-field shake-up, arrive with something Palace lack right now: clarity. No looming exits. No major distractions. Just points to chase and a clear objective under Liam Rosenior to finish in the Champions League places. In matches like this, that mental clarity is an underrated edge and does make Chelsea an interesting betting proposal at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Joelinton and emotional control have always lived on opposite sides of the street. He plays on the edge because Newcastle need him to. Intensity, duels, aggression - it's his job description. And against Aston Villa, that edge has repeatedly tipped into yellow card territory.",
      "Joelinton has been booked in five of the last seven meetings between Newcastle and Villa. That's not a coincidence. Villa bring the kind of technical ball carriers and intelligent movers that force Joelinton into recovery challenges, late tackles and tactical fouls.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins are card magnets. Since the start of last season, that trio have collectively drawn 48 cards from opposition players. They're clever with their movement, sharp on the turn and excellent at inviting contact in dangerous areas.",
      "The 9/4 with Sky Bet for Joelinton to be carded is a serious runner.",
      "Bukayo Saka's current run of 12 games without a goal in all competitions is his joint-longest drought for Arsenal. From a surface view, that type of run would put people off selecting him in the goalscorer markets. But I see it differently. Trends in football always snap. And timing is everything when it comes to snapping them for profit.",
      "Saka is still Arsenal's creative heartbeat, the outlet for danger and the player most likely to exploit half-chances in the final third. Arsenal are likely to control large portions of this game and Saka will be central to creating or finishing chances.",
      "From a betting standpoint, the question isn't whether Saka will score eventually - it's when. This looks the time to jump on at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin facing Everton for the first time in his career is a classic \"ex-factor\" scenario. A player with motivation, familiarity and unfinished business - all variables that can't be factored into his goalscorer prices. Add in his current form and this becomes a very juicy angle for punters. Calvert-Lewin has been in electric mood. Eight goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances underline his finishing sharpness and consistency.",
      "He's leading the line for a Leeds team that have netted 17 goals in their last nine Premier League games - second only to Manchester City (18), which paints a picture of a confident team. You can get 2/1 on Calvert-Lewin finding the net.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 20:32, UK",
      "There is a battle going on for several top strikers across Europe.",
      "Centre-forwards are wanted in every transfer window and always come at a premium, but this month several very good ones are on the market and some big clubs are circling.",
      "But do not rule out other clubs emerging either as it gets closer to the deadline, which is just 11 days away.",
      "Clubs interested: Juventus, Aston Villa",
      "Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave the club this month. He has wanted to leave since last summer when multiple clubs tried to sign him and he did not agree a new contract with Palace.",
      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",
      "However, Crystal Palace are not actively trying to sell Mateta and it would require a significant offer for the club to be tempted to sell.",
      "They still value Mateta around £35m and, as things stand, an exit is not close. In the background is uncertainty around head coach Oliver Glasner and the club are trying to stabilise a rocky point in their season.",
      "So far, Juventus are prepared to pay around £26m (€30m) to sign him in a proposal that would involve an initial loan for £1.7m and then a £24.3m obligation to buy in the summer.",
      "Sky in Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio has reported Palace have rejected an initial offer from Juventus. The Serie A club are willing to offer Mateta a four-year deal too with a significant pay rise.",
      "Palace turned down bids for Mateta from Champions League clubs in the summer and there was also a late enquiry - but no bid - from Tottenham Hotspur before they signed Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain on Deadline Day.",
      "Atalanta, AC Milan and several Premier League clubs were also interested in Mateta in the summer but a move did not happen.",
      "Since Glasner's first Premier League game in charge of Palace in February 2024, only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Mateta (35).",
      "At 28, he wants to play for a Champions League club or for a club who have a good chance of playing in the competition next season.",
      "He also wants to play for France in the World Cup after he was called up for the first time in October and he scored his first goal away at Iceland. But he faces tough competition for a place in a highly talented squad.",
      "Palace executive chairman Steve Parish is a notoriously tough negotiator, and he has always been reluctant to let any players leave on the cheap. And Palace want to strengthen their squad this month after selling Marc Guehi to Manchester City.",
      "They want to try and win the Conference League and finish as high as possible in the Premier League, keeping Glasner for the rest of his contract in the process.",
      "Club interested: Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa have been stepping up their efforts to sign Tammy Abraham after Villa officials and the player's representatives watched him play for Besiktas in Istanbul on Monday night. The club were in Turkey to play Fenerbahce on Thursday night.",
      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",
      "It is believed Besiktas now own Abraham's registration after he met the criteria to join them permanently amid an initial loan deal from Roma - and he is believed to keen to return to Villa, whom he spent time on loan at from Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Abraham spent a hugely successful 2018-19 season on loan at Villa from Chelsea. He scored 26 times to help Villa win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Other clubs - in the Premier League and in Europe - are also interested in Abraham this month and Villa now have injury problems in midfield, with John McGinn joining Boubakar Kamara on the sidelines.",
      "Villa have already been in for midfielders this month, missing out on signing Conor Gallagher to Tottenham Hotspur. They are also trying to find a solution for Harvey Elliott, whom they do not want to play any further to avoid having to sign him permanently from Liverpool for £35m.",
      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest",
      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eliezer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",
      "Youssef En Nesyri impressed as Morocco reached the AFCON final and it has ramped up interest in him from a number of clubs across Europe.",
      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 16:05, UK",
      "United's first goal against City on Saturday evoked something for those present at Old Trafford. You could not help but feel something.",
      "Instantly my mind went back to iconic goals scored against Arsenal. Whether that was in the Champions League second-leg in 2009 - led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Park-ji Sung and Wayne Rooney - or a year later in the Premier League where Nani and Rooney (again) led their own devastating counter-attacking display against the Gunners.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener was not just a classic counter-attacking goal. If you look at that second goal I just mentioned - it mirrored Rooney's lung-bursting run among five Arsenal players to receive the ball from Nani to score. Amad Diallo and Mbeumo showed the same urgency when Bruno Fernandes found himself in the perfect position to lead the counter.",
      "Context is then required. The weeks of tension and impatience building from the Old Trafford crowd after dour and frustrating performances against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month had led to most thinking: where was their next win going to come from?",
      "The Manchester derby was an impressive victory for Michael Carrick and his backroom staff, but there is also a hesitance to get too carried away. Despite that being the best 90 minute performance in years, this United team have shown they can deliver in one-off games.",
      "But I am already more curious as to how this team will perform in the games after Arsenal when Carrick's side face Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "This is where we will find out whether they are in serious contention for a Champions League place.",
      "I said similar in November and December when they had a run of games against 'lower' positioned opposition and they failed to capitalise during that time which eventually led to Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "This is a second chance.",
      "It was quite clear watching some of United's training session this week and speaking to those around the club as they prepared for Arsenal that there have been some subtle changes.",
      "Carrick addressed the players at the start of the session, as Amorim would, but it was still intriguing to see how hands on Carrick was in his role as head coach as they began their drills. This was the first time we had a glimpse of training with our Sky cameras in attendance.",
      "From the open section we saw, watching Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate and Steve Holland run the session in unison was fascinating.",
      "Holland, in particular, made an impression - pushing and encouraging the players to maintain a high level. It sounds obvious but Holland's experience carried a certain authority that was notable from where we were standing.",
      "One change under Carrick and his backroom staff has been shortening the sessions while increasing the intensity within them. There has been a notable and positive reaction among the first team in response.",
      "Although we were not able to see this in the open part of the session, from what I understand another positive change has been the increase in individual work with different players in the squad.",
      "It was widely understood under Amorim, the team would spend a lot of time on the training ground walking through systems and formations they would set up in.",
      "Despite Amorim saying this time on the training ground would yield more positive results the more this side trained on the pitch, that did not happen. This is not a criticism of the Portuguese coach but whatever the team worked on, it did not lead to the consistency needed for him to succeed.",
      "The shorter but intense sessions coupled with an increased amount of time spent on individual work has led (albeit one game in) to a positive atmosphere being created under Carrick.",
      "But there is also important messaging from Carrick and his staff.",
      "As mentioned before, no one inside or outside Carrington will get carried away with one win against Manchester City because of the false starts under previous coaches.",
      "But as Carrick announced to the media during his first week in charge, he has told his players they should enjoy playing for the club and while not getting carried away, embrace the responsibility and privilege that comes with the shirt.",
      "Time will tell whether these changes will have a short-lived impact on the team or whether they will be the foundations of a successful second-half of the season for United.",
      "What is clear is that this coaching staff have made an impression on this group of players and after such a challenging 14 months under Amorim if they can start enjoying their football again then they may just find themselves in the Champions League next season.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."
