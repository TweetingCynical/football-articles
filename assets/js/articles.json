      "Arsenal completed two transfers last week, with Viktor Gyokeres and Cristhian Mosquera joining the club, but they are not ready to stop there.",
      "Attention has now turned to Ebererchi Eze, with a £60million deal for the Crystal Palace playmaker being prepared by the Gunners. They are not the only team who are busy right now.",
      "Liverpool have splashed the cash in the summer transfer window, with an initial £265m already spent after the arrival of Hugo Ekitike, and while Alexander Isak remains on the radar, their current focus is sales. Luis Diaz is heading to Bayern Munich after a £65.5m deal was agreed with the German giants and Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott could follow him out of the door.",
      "Millwall are in talks with Luton Town in a bid to try and strike a deal for Alfie Doughty.",
      "The 25-year-old left wing-back was one of Luton's star performers in the Premier League before the Hatters suffered consecutive relegations and has been the subject of transfer interest this summer with the club now preparing for life in League One.",
      "The Lions are admirers of Doughty and would look to deploy him in a more advanced role in their attack rather than at left-back, where they are currently well stocked.",
      "Al-Nassr have snapped up one Premier League flop - and now they want another one!",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is heading to Saudi Arabia for an initial fee of £26million that could rise to around £43m with add-ons.",
      "And now the club of Cristiano Ronaldo are targeting Manchester United winger Antony, who revived his career with a loan move to Real Betis last season. Al-Nassr have made a bid for the Brazilian, whose agent has said he would be open to moving to the Middle East.",
      "Alexander Isak to Liverpool is still a possibility, but Darwin Nunez is unlikely to be going in the opposite direction as part of a swap deal.",
      "Luis Diaz's move to Bayern Munich would appear to have put paid to that, with Newcastle looking at Benjamin Sesko as an alternative striker option.",
      "Luis Diaz is on his way to Bayern Munich for £65.5million and the German club are clearing a path for him.",
      "Sky Sport Germany says that Bryan Zaragoza is heading to Celta Vigo on loan with an obligation to buy, just 18 months after arriving from Granada.",
      "The winger has not made an impact at Bayern and will return to Spain. Celta will pay €13million (£11m) to sign him permanently if a number of clauses are met.",
      "Jorrel Hato asked to be left out of Ajax's friendly against Como on the weekend because he's in negotiations to join Chelsea.",
      "Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad report that Hato told Ajax head coach John Heitinga that he would ‘rather not play’ on Sunday.",
      "The talented young defender has been eyed by a few Premier League clubs, but Chelsea appear to be in pole position.",
      "Ajax are understood to be seeking a fee of between €55-60million (£48m-£52.5m) for Hato.",
      "Manchester United are keeping a close eye on developments surrounding Gianluigi Donnarumma’s future at PSG. Talks over a new contract for the Italian goalkeeper have come to a standstill over recent weeks, and it appears that the French giants are ready to move on.",
      "According to L’Equipe, they are in talks with Ligue 1 rivals Lille regarding a deal for Lucas Chevalier, who is seen as a replacement for Donnarumma. And that has seen a couple of Premier League sides sit up and take notice.",
      "William Saliba says he will hopefully sign a new Arsenal contract \"soon\".",
      "The comments were made to AFTV after the Gunners' pre-season game with Newcastle on Sunday.",
      "The Frenchman has been linked with Real Madrid in recent months but Arsenal are keen to tie him down with fresh terms.",
      "Luis Diaz is getting his exit from Liverpool after Bayern Munich agreed a deal worth £65.5million.",
      "Diaz has been agitating for a move all summer and had been keen to join Barcelona. He's now left Liverpool's pre-season tour to go and complete his transfer to Bayern.",
      "Arsenal had hoped to use Reiss Nelson as a makeweight in a deal with Crystal Palace for Eberechi Eze, but that now seems very unlikely.",
      "Nelson spent last season on loan with Fulham and is in talks over a move back to Craven Cottage.",
      "Arsenal hope they can still land Eze and believe a £60million deal is doable, despite his release clause being £68m.",
      "And welcome to another day of transfer news.",
      "We're fast hurtling towards the start of the Premier League season and the clock is ticking on clubs to get their business done."

      "Manchester United are weighing up a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma after Paris Saint-Germain agreed a £34.9million deal to sign a new goalkeeper. Donnarumma, 26, has seen his future plunged into uncertainty after failing to agree a new contract.",
      "The Italy international's current deal with PSG expires next summer and the European champions don't want to lose him for nothing. Luis Enrique's side will therefore listen to offers for Donnarumma after striking an agreement with Lille to sign Lucas Chevalier.",
      "PSG's move could spring United into action, with Ruben Amorim keen on a new goalkeeper of his own. The Red Devils are understood to be interested in Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens, who'd provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Although Onana has no plans to leave Old Trafford, the Cameroonian's form has been an issue for Amorim. The United manager even took the 29-year-old out of the firing line towards the end of last season after a string of mistakes.",
      "But instead of signing an up-and-coming shot-stopper like Lammens, the vastly experienced Donnarumma could be an option after privately discussing a move to England with his Italy team-mates. French outlet L'Equipe report that as PSG prepare to welcome Chevalier, both United and rivals Manchester City have registered their interest in Donnarumma.",
      "Chelsea have also been linked with a move while Galatasaray are said to have gone a step further by making a formal approach. It'd be a surprise if City put their hat in the ring after they struck a £27m deal with Burnley to re-sign James Trafford.",
      "The topic of Donnarumma's future was bubbling under the surface as the ex-AC Milan wonderkid helped PSG finally get their hands on the Champions League in May. As recently as last month, Donnarumma confirmed that it was his priority to stay in Paris.",
      "\"My priority is to stay at PSG, I don't think there will be any problems in the negotiations,\" Donnarumma told Sky Italia on June 9. \"We're a great team.\"",
      "Napoli have also been linked with Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - dismissed the speculation by labelling it 'pure fantasy'. \"I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project.",
      "\"In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juventus who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganising: these factors are fundamental.\"",

United ended last season in 15th place, their lowest finish for 15 years, and also missed out on Europe for only the second time in 35 years after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",

      "They say it is the biggest humiliation a footballer can experience: being a substitute that, after getting on the pitch, is then subbed off. So why did Hansi Flick bring on Marcus Rashford for 30 minutes on his Barcelona debut - and then take him off again?",
      "Rashford, 27, appeared for the first since completing his season-long loan move from Manchester United in midweek, ending his exile at Old Trafford. The forward's transfer - which includes a £26million option to buy - was finalised in time for him to fly to Japan with the rest of Barca's squad, as they embark on a pre-season tour of Asia. First up was a clash with Japanese side Vissel Kobe in a friendly match which was initially suspended before organisers scrambled to make it happen.",
      "Rashford was named on the bench by Flick before the German changed his entire line-up at half-time. The United loanee showed promise during his 30-minute cameo, notably playing a crucial role when fellow new signing Roony Bardghji got on the scoresheet in Barcelona's 3-1 win.",
      "After defender Jofre Torrents won back possession on the left, Rashford collected the ball and played a perfectly-weighted pass through to Robert Lewandowski. Barca's No.9 then picked out Bardghji on the right, as the former Copenhagen hotshot produced an impressive first-time finish.",
      "Seconds later, Rashford was brought off. The England international and Torrents were replaced by Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, scorer of Barcelona's third goal, in the 77th minute.",
      "Post-match, Flick was asked about his decision to haul both Rashford and Torrents off after half an hour each.",
      "\"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury,\" the Barcelona manager explained. Which, obviously, makes perfect sense for a player who, just seven days ago, was a member of Manchester United's 'bomb squad' training alone and made to use the club's Carrington training ground when the first-team squad had gone home.",
      "For Flick, these early days are about getting Rashford up to speed, slowly but surely, helping him adjust to what he wants. Do it correctly, and it's another match winner among Barca's collection of stars. Subbing him on and then off in a pre-season friendly? Not a problem for the manager nor his new player.",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Flick was a 'key' reason why Rashford joined the La Liga champions, having led Barcelona to three trophies in his first season. \"He was another key factor for me to join Barca,\" the 27-year-old revealed during his unveiling.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive. He has proven to be one of the top coaches... He led a young team to such a successful season and has returned to the preseason wanting more.\"",
      "Rashford's team-mates are already looking forward to playing alongside him. \"Rashford is a very talented player,\" Lewandowski told reporters in Japan.",
      "\"We played Manchester United two years ago and he was in great form. He can help us and is able to play in different positions.\"",

It is suggested that the London side would be willing to offer the youngster instant Premier League football, while United see him as one for the future.",

      "Amorim also confirmed forward Joshua Zirkzee is recovering from a \"small issue\", while Noussair Mazraoui was absent from the West Ham win due to a knock. It gives Amorim three weeks to make decisions over his side for United's season opener against Arsenal.",
      "Asked for his thoughts on that game, the Portuguese coach added: \"I think we need to not just prepare for the games but teach the game to the players because, nowadays, the build-up from the opponents, sometimes you don't know what is going to happen.",
      "\"A lot of midfielders dropping into the defence, the defenders starting to run. So you cannot control it like in the past, like you know they are going to build with four. These small things we need to prepare for the game but they need to understand for any situation, and we try to do that during training.\"",
      "He added: \"It's a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team. That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",
      "Before United's first game of the season against Arsenal, they also face further friendlies against Everton and Fiorentina.",

      "Signing a player compared to Erling Haaland is one thing - but signing one many believe is better? Now that's a mouthwatering prospect. For Manchester United, that prospect may become reality if they land Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The RB Leipzig striker, who is being linked with a blockbuster £60million move to Old Trafford, had the unenviable task of filling Haaland's shoes at Red Bull Salzburg. In just half a season in Austria, a teenage Haaland smashed 28 goals in 22 games before sealing a career-launching switch to Borussia Dortmund - turning down United in the process.",
      "A year later, Sesko arrived at Salzburg with the same towering frame, explosive playing style, and sky-high expectations. The comparisons to Haaland were inevitable. And while he wasn't quite as ruthless in front of goal, Sesko made just as big an impression - and, in the eyes of some, an even bigger one.",
      "\"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy,\" the Slovenian said in 2021. \"They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko's rise hasn't been as meteoric as Haaland's, but if he secures a Premier League move this summer, he'll have done so at the same age his Norwegian counterpart made the leap. Arsenal looked set to sign the 22-year-old earlier in the window, but ultimately pivoted to Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea have also shown interest in Sesko, but after signing Hugo Ekitike and Liam Delap respectively, both clubs now look out of the running. This has given United something of a free run at the striker, but a deal is far from guaranteed.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed £133m on attacking reinforcements, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - and with concerns about the club's financial situation lingering, any further moves must be approached with caution.",
      "Then there's the matter of convincing Sesko himself. Without Champions League football on offer, United are at a disadvantage against several domestic and European rivals. And with the striker tied to RB Leipzig until 2029, neither he nor the club are under pressure to make a decision quickly.",
      "United will also be hoping Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season, has had a change of heart since turning down a move to Old Trafford in 2023, opting instead for RB Leipzig - a decision he later attributed to concerns over United's style of play.",
      "\"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig],\" Sesko admitted in 2024.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "Now, with a new manager, a fresh attacking core, and a point to prove, United are hoping the timing - and the project - feel different this time around.",
      "If they can convince Sesko that Old Trafford is where he can become not just the next Haaland, but the first Sesko, it could mark the beginning of a new era - one built not just on reputation or comparisons, but on potential fully realised in red.",

      "Ruben Amorim hailed the enduring value and leadership of captain Bruno Fernandes after he inspired Manchester United to victory in their US tour opener.",
      "Fernandes scored both goals in United's 2-1 win over West Ham at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, the first from the penalty spot and the second a sublime strike from 20 yards out.",
      "The United skipper said he would have happily left in the summer, with Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal willing to pay £100million for him, if the club decided it was time to cash in on their prized asset.",
      "But United stuck to their stance that Fernandes was not for sale, despite the huge offer from Al Hilal for a player who turns 31 in less than two months.",
      "And after Fernandes produced a man-of-the-match display to get United's Stateside tour off to a winning start, boss Amorim underlined why he remains such a key player.",
      "“It was so clear last season,” said Amorim. “You can see it in the assists, the goals, but not just that. I think now he has more players [around him]. I've felt that on the tour. I feel that now there are more players to help him to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "“But he's our leader, so he's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and sometimes he plays with pain.",
      "“The problem is that sometimes he gets frustrated and sometimes he loses a little bit of the focus of his job. Sometimes he wants to help his team-mates so much that sometimes it's not the best thing to do.",
      "“They all have to learn. They have to do their job. Bruno also has to wait for the ball in different situations. This kind of thing is what a leader does, but he needs help and he's going to have help.",
      "“Bruno has a function or a position for every game. It's impossible to play in all of the positions. Last year I felt that sometimes I pushed him back, to have more possession in the build-up, and then we missed Bruno near the box.",
      "“I think with different characteristics, with Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo, I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, I think he will have more help this season.",
      "“Bruno runs a lot. Maybe in the sprint he's a different player, but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance. He's smart. The physicality of Bruno is not the concern. He's ready for the physicality, playing deep or as a midfielder.”",
      "Amorim picked a strong team against West Ham and revealed he did so because he needs the team that is likely to start the season to get up to speed as quickly as possible.",
      "“It was a strong team because we need to prepare all the players,” said Amorim. “We needed to take this game seriously. We don't have a lot of weeks, a lot of games to prepare all of the team, but that can change. It's rare that the team plays more than an hour on their first tour game.",
      "“But I was expecting this from the team at this moment. We have all the data, all the information. We know that at this stage they can cope with 70 minutes with a high tempo. So it wasn't a surprise.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Daily Mirror Manchester Football Correspondent, covering Manchester United and Manchester City. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "After the pain and misery of last season, there was much for Ruben Amorim to be optimistic about after Manchester United's opening US tour game.",
      "Ending last season in 15th place – United's lowest finish for 51 years – and missing out on Europe for only the second time in 35 years have made this a crucial pre-season.",
      "Against that backdrop, United began their three-game tour of the States with an impressive performance against Premier League rivals West Ham at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium.",
      "Here is what United boss Amorim will have learned from his team's hard-fought win...",
      "New £62.5million signing Matheus Cunha impressed with his attacking threat and industry, while midfielder Manuel Ugarte pressed with intensity and striker Rasmus Hojlund looked sharp and hungry.",
      "There were other plus points for Amorim – Kobbie Mainoo's influence in a deeper midfield role, Patrick Dorgu's marauding runs down the left and the enduring quality of skipper Bruno Fernandes, who gave United a first-half lead from the penalty spot.",
      "The crowd at the venue for next year's World Cup final may have been sparse – the 80,000-capacity stadium half-full at most – but fans were treated to a competitive game.",
      "Former United managers have made wholesale changes at half-time in pre-season games, but Amorim's plan was to play his starting line-up until the 70th minute, to build up their fitness levels, before making substitutions.",
      "Amorim picked a strong side, although new £71m signing Bryan Mbeumo was left out, with his pre-season preparation slightly behind that of his team-mates.",
      "Pre-season games, particularly the opening ones, can be tepid affairs, with players minded to ease themselves into games gently, for fear of injury or pushing themselves too much.",
      "But United played with a fervour and commitment, epitomised by Ugarte's willingness to snap into tackles and win back possession within seconds of his side losing it.",
      "United served notice of their intent early on, Cunha winning the ball just outside his own area, Dorgu finding Fernandes, who in turn put Hojlund through on goal.",
      "The much-maligned striker, who managed just 12 goals last season, outpaced Max Kilman before striking a post with a left-footed effort.",
      "Minutes later United were in front after West Ham keeper Alphonse Areola dropped the ball then fouled Ayden Heaven in a clumsy attempt to retrieve it, Fernandes coolly dispatching the resulting spot-kick.",
      "With Amorim urging his players to maintain their rhythm and intensity, all the more impressive in the oppressive 80 F temperature, United continued to dominate.",
      "Hojlund scooped a shot over in the 16th minute, while Cunha's tenacity in retrieving the ball and winning a corner led to Leny Yoro heading just wide. Ugarte won possession and fed Amad, who applied a clinical finish, but the goal was ruled out for offside.",
      "But United doubled their lead in the 52nd minute, Mainoo intercepting a poor pass out from Areola then finding Fernandes, who steered a sublime finish into the top left corner.",
      "With the 70 minute mark looming and United's starting line-up tiring, Jarrod Bowen pulled a goal back for Hammers with a fine angled finish, which prompted Amorim to make 10 outfield changes slightly earlier than he planned.",
      "Those who came on struggled to keep possession as assuredly as the starting line-up, allowing West Ham more time on the ball and meaning United came under sustained pressure to maintain their lead and see out the game, which they duly did, with Altay Bayindir making a fine save to deny Bowen a second goal deep into added time.",

      "Mbeumo has trained with his new colleagues in recent days and travelled to the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey but was a notable absence on the teamsheet. It appears he is not quite match fit, with Brentford starting their pre-season preparations a week after United.",
      "Amorim has already proven himself a tough manager when it comes to fitness and Mbeumo's absence follows a similar trend of decisions by the Portuguese. Noussair Mazraoui was another key player missing, with the defender absent through a 'knock'.",
      "Fellow new recruit Matheus Cunha, who arrived after his £62.5 million release clause at Wolves was triggered, did start in what was a reasonably strong starting XI against West Ham.",
      "Altay Bayinder started in goal amid Andre Onana's own injury problems, with Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Ayden Heaven ahead of him. Amad and Patrick Dorgu operated in the wing back roles with Mainoo and Ugarte playing central midfield. Bruno Fernandes, Rasmus Hojlund and Cunha led the line.",
      "United ran out 2-1 winners thanks to two goals from Fernandes. Jarrod Bowen pulled one back on the hour mark as the Red Devils held out for a win.",
      "Amorim's team will face Bournemouth on Wednesday but Mbeumo will have to wait beyond that to get his first minutes. The United boss is instead hopeful Mbeumo will play against Everton on Sunday. While his fitness may be a slight concern, there should be no worries over his mentality.",

      "After recording 45 minutes of first team action against Leeds, Matheus Cunha played another 65 minutes for Manchester United against West Ham on Sunday. Ruben Amorim's side won the encounter 2-1 and while Bruno Fernandes netted both in a man of the match display, Cunha also impressed.",
      "The 26-year-old arrived from Wolves for £62.5 million and, quite frankly, he's a player United have been crying out for. Forgetting the goals he will bring, Cunha's physicality and zealous nature will be warmly welcome at Old Traffford.",
      "After just two minutes, Cunha's best work was at the other end of the pitch. Mucking in on the edge of United's box, the Brazilian won the ball back to turn over possession. His aggression ultimately led to Hojlund baring down on goal and hitting the post.",
      "There's a clear need for him to prove himself and there was no greater example than his long shot at goal midway through the first half. Maybe it was a little eager but it was positive and direct.",
      "His ability to use either foot, as he feigned on one and hit it with the other, will also prove problematic for defenders.",
      "After 35 minutes when his pass to Hojlund on the edge of the box didn't pay off, his verocious nature to win the ball back led to him earning the opportunity of a shot on goal. It was ultimately blocked but the desire was more promising than the end product.",
      "Amorim stuck with his starting XI at half-time, resisting the urge to make wholesale changes to get as many minutes in as many different legs as possible. Perhaps a hint that he is finding his strongest XI already. Cunha is very much a part of that.",
      "Just moments into the second half Cunha broke through the Hammers midfield, driving the ball forward more like a rugby player than a footballer. He did something similar against Leeds too.",
      "That ability to be tough to tackle and burst through the ranks as United transition from defence to attack is something they desperately need.",
      "And to prove his earlier defensive heroics weren't a fluke, on the hour mark he was sliding to win the ball again. His crucial touch was followed by Amad also sliding to win the ball. United won it back.",
      "With the exception of the ever-exasperated Fernandes, it oftentimes felt last season as though only the young Ivory Coast international was the one willing to chase down every ball and put in the effort. Cunha is willing too.",
      "While attitude question marks off the pitch remain, there is no doubting his voracious nature on it.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha will bolster the team's attack with Ruben Amorim claiming either man could play as a central striker if needs must. The United boss has also claimed he's happy to press on with his squad as it looks despite the lack of change.",
      "He said during the club's pre-season tour: \"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player. If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last term, but Amorim has been afforded the chance to work with his team on his philosophy and system throughout pre-season. That wasn't a luxury he had last term with United's recruitment potentially slowing down.",
      "United have been linked with moves for the likes of Emi Martinez, having a loan approach rejected by Aston Villa, and the MEN understands there is not currently a budget set aside to fund a new No.1 for the club.",
      "Despite not having the funds to go after a new goalkeeper Andre Onana has made it clear he wants to stay in Manchester and has received reassurances that he won't be sold or replaced.",
      "The most likely departure there would perhaps be Altar Bayindir with Tom Heaton, the veteran goalkeeper on the club's books, recently extending his deal. Onana was dropped for a match last term by Amorim, but he still remains the first choice going into the new season.",
      "Amorim has dismissed the notion that Mbeumo and Cunha both choose to move to Manchester to increase their pay cheques given they had offers elsewhere that would've seen them play in the Champions League. The United boss claimed it is \"lies\" to consider the duo only made the switch because of financial motives.",
      "He told the club's website: “Cunha and Bryan, they had different solutions [offers]. They had Champions League offers. And they wanted to come here. People that say that they come here because of the money… that is a lie. That I know for sure. So, I’m really happy with that.",
      "“That is the key point. They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project. And then one really important thing is that they want to come here.\"",
      "Cole Palmer has been tipped to join move to United in the future despite his Chelsea deal tying him down until 2033. Former Red Devils coach Rene Meulensteen told Grosvenor Casino: \"It’s almost a public secret that Cole Palmer is a Manchester United fan, what surprised me is how he slipped through the fingers of United with him being at Manchester City and then getting his chance at Chelsea.",
      "“He is a player that can make a difference, could he play for United in the future? Yeah, I can't see why not. Obviously, he's got a long-term contract with Chelsea, but sometimes things don't work out and players and clubs fall out, then United would be interested and it could be a really good destination for him. He is a United fan after all and he is a player that would bring United back to a higher level.\"",

      "The first came from the spot after a messy Alphonse Areola catch led to Ayden Heaven being fouled. The second came just after the interval after another mistake from the Hammers keeper. Kobbie Mainoo capitalized to tee up Fernandes who produced a sublime finish.",

      "And it stayed that way until the 65th minute. The fact this team lasted more than an hour shows you where Amorim's head is with his preferred players. Add to the context Bryan Mbeumo wasn't quite ready, Noussair Mazraoui was carrying a knock, and Joshua Zirkzee wasn't in the squad, it's clear the United boss is using pre-season to get his strongest side playing their strongest football as soon as possible. It's a luxury he didn't get last year.",
      "United looked sharp, carried a zip and an energy to their play that hasn't been seen for some time. Most pleasing for Amorim will no doubt be the positivity. There's a long way to go but the pressing was also improved. The defence helped the midfield and the midfield helped the attack. A marked improvement.",

      "Depending on where Amorim sees Mazraoui and Shaw, United's back three of Yoro, De Ligt, and Heaven, is about as strong as it comes. It may well be the back three that starts against Arsenal in three weeks' time.",
      "De Ligt played in the anchor role at the back, mopping up scraggly chances and loose balls. And beside the Dutchman he had Yoro on the right and Heaven on the left. While not perfect, the performance of the three was solid. If a little untidy at times, it did its job in the main.",
      "The worry for Amorim should be that this was against a pretty lifeless West Ham attack. The prospect of those three facing Viktor Gyokeres, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli is a little unnerving.",
      "While still raw, the talent in Yoro is clear. He needs more time. Heaven is even younger and Bowen's goal is a prime example that he has much to learn in anticipation and shutting down attackers.",
      "Does the back three have potential? Yes. Is it a top four defence? No. Far from it.",
      "It's worth remembering that Hojlund is only 22 years of age. And despite his form last season there's never a United side that should have relied upon him as their out-and-out goalscorer. That notwithstanding, it was him or Joshua Zirkzee. Zirkzee is not a striker, he's a false nine or a 10 who, at times, had United fans licking their lips with his quick feet and link-up play.",
      "So that leaves Hojlund. After a mere two minutes he showed his three best attributes - speed, strength and mentality. After Cunha won the ball on the edge of the box, Hojlund found himself on the break one v one with West Ham defender Max Kilman. Hojlund outmuscled him, sprinted past him and found himself with an opportunity on goal.",
      "That's where his weakest attribute came in - finishing. The shot was fierce and smashed off the left upright. It was a good chance he carved out for himself but he couldn't apply the finishing touch.",
      "Only moments later he found himself with the ball at his feet in the penalty area. The result was a ballooned shot over the bar. It's always a snatched shot or a power strike rather than a caressed finish for Hojlund. There's no doubting his determination to chase down every ball but that's not enough.",
      "At times last season the Dane was left frustrated by Alejandro Garnacho's selfishness. But with Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha he can expect a lot more service this time around. However, Amorim will need decide quick if he gambles on his goals coming from his two new signings via Zirkzee or from a hit or miss Hojlund.",
      "Amorim has never quite figured out where he wants to play Fernandes. In part, that's due to him being so good the United boss probably wishes he could play him in five positions.",
      "But Amorim did make a mistake in the Europa League final dropping Fernandes deep. Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro had established a semi-solid partnership through the previous European games. The captain replacing Ugarte left not only a hole in attack but created an inability to stop Spurs running through the midfield.",
      "Casemiro's age and Ugarte's legs have left a lot to be desired and it is why United are crying out for a defensive midfielder. It is therefore interesting that Fernandes started in one of the No. 10 positions against West Ham. He was instrumental in several transitions of attack, linking up with Cunha a little better than he did with Hojlund.",
      "His cross ultimately led to Areola's blunder which the penalty came from and it was of course he who slotted neatly from the penalty spot. Like usual, he had no problem bossing his teammates about but it felt a little more commanding coming from an attacking position.",
      "And because he was further forward he was also in a position to delicately curl one past Areola for United's second.",
      "And because Fernandes was further forward it meant Kobbie Mainoo partnered Ugarte in midfield. While at times the common vulnerability of teams running through the pair did show, like when Tomas Soucek had too much room to slot in Bowen, there was still some promise.",
      "Prior to kick-off Amorim declared that he has \"Big plans\" for Mainoo while lauding his talent. And it was on this very pitch two years ago that Mainoo's performance against Arsenal in pre-season caught the eye. It's fitting that he once again purred on the ball.",
      "His silky footwork and confidence on the ball drew \"Oohs\" and \"Aahs\" from the crowd. But perhaps what Amorim will be most pleased with was his doggedness to win the ball. Mainoo raced onto Areola's poor goalkick to intercept the ball in the second half. He quickly fed it to Fernandes who produced a sumptuous finish.",
      "His partner, Ugarte, flattered to deceive last season but did show a side to his play not many have seen. The Uruguayan quickly won the ball back after Mainoo ran into a Claret wall. He proceeded to nutmeg one player before feeding through Amad who neatly slotted away his chance. Unfortunately for the pair it was offside.",
      "It's not rock solid, as Bowen's goal showed, but it was better than last season.",

      "Ruben Amorim presided over a horror campaign last term as United finished 15th in the Premier League, and marked improvements are now being demanded after a summer on the training pitch and some shrewd recruitment.",
      "The club have been keen to bolster their misfiring attack this summer, alongside Mbeumo and Cunha, Diego Leon has been added, but there are several issues that still exist within the United squad and Shearer claims they have a number of problems areas to address before they can even think about trying to qualify for the Europa League.",
      "United are yet to add a No 9 given the struggles experienced by the likes of Rasmus Hojlund. No new wing-backs have come in despite Amorim playing a 3-4-3 formation and they continue to persevere with Andre Onana in goal.",
      "Shearer told Betfair: \"Last year was a disaster for Man United. It will be better than that this season I've no doubt, but how much better will depend on how much business they do between now and the end of the transfer window.",
      "\"There's no doubt they need a top-class centre-forward which would go well with Cunha and Mbuemo so they've still got business to do and it depends on what quality they bring in. Even with just Cunha and Mbuemo, there's no doubt they'll improve on last season. As I said, they're still three, maybe four top players away from challenging for the top six.\"",
      "Amorim has claimed that, should he begin the season against Arsenal in mid-August with his current squad then he would be happy. However concerns remain around United, who ended up being 24 points off the Champions League spots and 42 off champions Liverpool.",
      "Shearer has also been quick to point out that Mbeumo, one of their major recruits, will leave midseason to take part in the Africa Cup of Nations. That will place more pressure on United's depth.",
      "He said: \"Mbuemo will likely be going to AFCON, but you know that when you sign these players. You just have to get on with it and accept it. He'll be a big player for Man United so to be without him for that amount of time will hurt him and Man United but other clubs will have the same problem.\"",
      "United have reportedly had a loan offer for Emi Martinez turned down. Aston Villa have also made it clear that Ollie Watkins is not for sale. Earlier in the summer Liam Delap, who was on the club's radar, picked a move to Chelsea ahead of a switch to Manchester.",

Ruben Amorim has been incredibly busy this summer with regards to enhancing the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag in November, welcoming a host of fresh faces to Old Trafford.",
      "United struck a deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha as the early window opened in June in a £59.5million move, before finally sealing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo after negotiations with Brentford dragged out for the best part of a month. In the end, the two sides agreed a fee which could reach as high as £71m including add-ons, as the Cameroon international looks to hit the ground running in the north west.",
      "It comes after United suffered a sub-par 16th-place finish in the Premier League last season, and fans will hope for a better showing in 2025/26 given that Amorim has received the backing of the board and a full pre-season campaign. West Ham, meanwhile, finished 14th last time around, and will hope to start the season strongly when they kick off their Premier League campaign against newly-promoted Sunderland next month.",
      "Graham Potter has also been active during thetransfer window, welcoming Kyle Walker-Peters from Southampton on a free, as well as acquiring El Hadji Malick Diouf from Slavia Prague for £19m and Jean-Clair Todibo from Nice in a £32.8m move after a successful loan spell.",
      "Manchester United's pre-season clash with West Ham is a part of the Premier League Summer Series mini-tournament which is taking place in the USA this weekend, with Bournemouth and Everton also taking part. As a result, the Red Devils will meet the Hammers at the 82,500-capacity MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which is home to the New York Giants and the New York Jets of the NFL.",

      "It's not the only late game of the tournament either, with Everton's clash with Bournemouth having taken place at 9pm, also on Saturday. West Ham's game with Everton on Wednesday gets underway at 11.30pm, and United's clash with Bournemouth starts at 2.30am UK time on Thursday.",

      "Ruben Amorim is wasting no time in ensuring last season's worst-ever Premier League campaign for Manchester United was a one-off.",
      "Amorim has been up at 6am on United's pre-season tour of the US, wasting no time and using every minute to plan with his coaching staff ahead of the new campaign.",
      "The United head coach is relishing a first full pre-season with his squad, having wanted to wait until this summer to take over, but being forced to take over midway through last term.",
      "Taking charge midway through a season is never ideal, not least when Amorim changed United's system from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3, a radical departure from what the players were used to. United's players struggled to get to grips with the new formation, the upshot a 15th-placed finish, the club's worst position for 51 years, while they also missed out on Europe after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "But the doom and gloom of last season has been replaced by a tangible air of optimism and excitement among the United squad and management during the first week of their three-game US tour.",
      "Amorim has left behind those players who want out of United and who could spread a negative influence within the US tour party, namely Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malacia. Marcus Rashford, who fell out with Amorim within weeks of the new manager's arrival, has begun a new chapter at Barcelona, and only players fully committed to the team are present in the US.",
      "Amorim underlined that message ahead of United's tour opener, against Premier League rivals West Ham, in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, where next year's World Cup final will be held. The United boss stressed the importance of his first pre-season in terms of building a bond with his players, for them to strengthen existing relationships and build new ones with Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon.",
      "The connection between £133.5million duo Cunha and Mbeumo will be crucial as Amorim looks to solve United's goal scoring problems, his side having only managed to find the net 44 times in the league last season.",
      "Amorim still wants to recruit a new No.9 to lead United's attack, but knows that in Cunha and Mbeumo, he has two players with a proven ability to score in the league, the pair netting 15 and 20 goals respectively last season.",
      "“They can both play as a striker,” said Amorim. “But we also have Josh [Zirkzee], we have Rasmus [Hojlund], so our focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the position is there for them. They have to work and they have other players who are fighting for that position.",
      "“But again, I'm really pleased, because they proved that the qualities that they have, they are really humble, which is really important, and the best thing is that they chose to be here. In our club at the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player. So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy, because all the players who are here want to be here - that for me is the most important thing.",
      "“With Matheus and Brian - also Diego, but Diego is a different situation because he's a potential player. But with Matheus and Bryan, we are clearly a better team.”",

      "A move for Benjamin Sesko to Manchester United appears unlikely - at least if the striker's past comments are anything to go by. United have been searching for a new centre forward all summer, but have so far failed to secure a suitable signing.",
      "They missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal and Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool, while efforts to land Victor Osimhen and Ollie Watkins have also come up short. As a result, they've turned their attention to Sesko - who was previously in talks to join Arsenal before negotiations stalled and the Gunners pivoted to Gyokeres instead.",
      "RB Leipzig are believed to have lowered their asking price for Sesko, with the Slovenian striker now available for around £60million, according to BILD. However, any hopes United have of securing his signature may depend on whether Sesko has softened his stance on the club.",
      "United made an approach for him in 2023 following his breakout season at Red Bull Salzburg, where he netted 18 goals in all competitions and attracted interest from several top European sides. In the end, Sesko opted for a move to Leipzig - and later hinted that United's style of play had been a key factor in his decision to turn down a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "\"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig],\" he admitted in 2024.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "After missing out on Sesko, the Red Devils turned to another highly rated but similarly unproven talent in Rasmus Hojlund, spending £72m on the young Dane. Two years on, however, the career trajectories of the two strikers have diverged significantly.",
      "Sesko has gone from strength to strength, scoring 18 and then 21 goals in successive seasons for RB Leipzig. Hojlund, on the other hand, has struggled to find his footing.",
      "After being thrown into a faltering United side, he has battled inconsistency and a lack of goals, and now appears likely to leave the club with his reputation diminished. Hojlund's struggles suggest Sesko was right to pick Leipzig - a club where he could hone his skills and develop without the weight of expectation that comes with leading the line for a Premier League colossal like United.",
      "Ironically, two years later, Sesko may yet make the move he once rejected. United's head of scouting, Christopher Vivell, is a known admirer and has personally watched the Slovenian striker in action.",
      "The 22-year-old could become the focal point of United's new-look front line, joining recent arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to form a revamped attacking trio. The club have already splashed £133m this summer, and signing Sesko would take their total outlay close to £200m.",
      "But with Marcus Rashford being shipped off to Barcelona and Hojlund heavily linked with an exit, reinforcements up front aren't just a priority - they're a necessity.",
      "Sesko is not agitating for a move, and with his contract running until 2029, Leipzig are under no immediate pressure to sell. However, it's understood that if their £60m valuation is met, they would be open to letting him speak with interested clubs.",
      "The fee could represent a relative bargain in today's market, but United had the chance to sign him for a fraction of that price just a few years ago. Back in 2021, then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer recommended the club move for the then-18-year-old, who was available for just £2.5m. United declined, viewing the deal as too risky.",

    "body": [
      "Ruben Amorim has been on Kobbie Mainoo’s case to increase his “rhythm and pace”. Mainoo was quick to intercept Alphonse Areola’s pass to assist Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes caressed the ball as nonchalantly as David Beckham to put United 2-0 up against West Ham. He could have purely milked the acclaim yet made a beeline for Mainoo.",
      "This was the second time Mainoo walked off the MetLife Stadium pitch to murmurs of approval. As an 18-year-old two years ago, he outshone an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard. Erik ten Hag did not attend a post-match press conference but paused in the mixed zone to wax lyrical about Mainoo to us journalists.",
      "It was apparent that Ten Hag was preparing Mainoo not for the first team squad but the first team. Cruelly, 80 seconds into the friendly with Real Madrid in Houston the following week, Casemiro fouled Rodrygo, who collided into Mainoo’s ankle and he was sidelined for four months.",
      "Back in the United States for his second pre-season tour, Mainoo’s challenge is to regain his place rather than gain it. It augurs well that Amorim not only picked him from the start against West Ham but played Mainoo in midfield, his natural habitat.",
      "Mainoo has occupied three different roles in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system but it is in his and the team’s interests that he returns to midfield. United have a surfeit of possible No.10s - Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee. They have a shortage of out-and-out central midfielders and Mainoo is one of four.",
      "“I liked Kobbie Mainoo’s game,” Amorim enthused at the MetLife. That was unprompted. He was especially pleased with how Mainoo and the domineering Manuel Ugarte upped the intensity after the drab draw with Leeds United seven days earlier. Both started on the bench in Sweden.",
      "Amorim lamented “the lack of pace” in midfield against Leeds. He picked Fernandes and Casemiro, players with a combined age of 63. That rotational team in Stockholm seemed to be solely about fitness. In New Jersey, United’s starting XI could feasibly line up against Arsenal at Old Trafford on August 17.",
      "\"I spoke about that against Leeds because I felt like everybody in the midfield, the pace was not there,\" Amorim explained. \"Today it was there. Manuel and Kobbie did that job.\"",
      "\"I like the mentality of us today,\" Matthijs de Ligt added. \"High pressing, a lot of intensity.\" Mainoo and Ugarte underpinned that.",
      "Of the outfield players, Mainoo was maybe the least assured of keeping his place. Bryan Mbeumo could muscle his way in, though he will not play until the third tour match against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. United only have one more friendly - at home to Fiorentina on August 9 - before Arsenal board their train to Manchester Piccadilly.",
      "2024-25 was not a season teeming with highlights for Mainoo but he excelled at Arsenal in the spirited FA Cup third round triumph. Arsenal will likely have Rice and Rodri’s heir, Martin Zubimendi, to pit against United’s midfield axis.",
      "Amorim leaned on Casemiro in the final months of last season, predominantly in the Europa League. Mainoo and Ugarte are better equipped to compete with Rice, Zubimendi and Fernandes’ opposite number, Martin Odegaard.",
      "It has gone quiet on the new contract front for Mainoo. He last scrawled his signature on United papers in February 2023 when he was still a teenager and had made two appearances. The deal was highly incentivised but his profile has expanded vastly since, so much so that Nike made a song-and-dance about his renewal last year, arranging for Mainoo to play in a five-a-side game at Venice Beach. United have to remunerate him.",
      "As much of a wrench as it would be for members of the academy to see Alejandro Garnacho depart after five years, Garnacho hails from Madrid, not Manchester. His arrogance was so apparent in the academy that it was inevitable he would not be a one-club man and one day angle for a return to the land of his birth.",
      "It is different with Mainoo. He is a Mancunian and a boyhood United fan. The era of the one-club is in danger of ending and United is the club that has to rail against that.",
      "It is not pure sentiment to safeguard Mainoo’s future. He was integral to United’s FA Youth Cup and FA Cup successes, two of their highlights this decade. His winner at Wembley is one of the great Cup final goals. Mainoo left Wembley that day looking like a schoolboy on a field trip, with his shirt tucked out and a bucket hat resting on his noggin.",
      "He didn’t stand still. Weeks later, Mainoo transformed England’s midfield in their run to the European Championship final. He would enhance most midfields.",
      "Some supporters will be nervous about Mainoo’s sellable asset status. Midfield is also an area where United want to strengthen, once they have made room. Selling Mainoo is a prospect they cannot entertain and, as insignificant as pre-season matches are, Mainoo’s selection against West Ham was somewhat significant.",
      "Whenever Mainoo started in the second half of last season, it was in domestic matches between European ties. Amorim is evidently willing to compromise now, bringing Mainoo back into the midfield fold, and there is not as much noise around him as there was with Scott McTominay last year. Fulham had submitted two offers for McTominay by late July 2024.",
      "Two years ago, Mainoo’s sudden prominence made United receptive to selling McTominay. The plans changed when Rodrygo ploughed into Mainoo’s ankle. Hopefully, he avoids such misfortune in Chicago.",
      "Then he can continue to perfect his rhythm.",

      "Two goals from captain Bruno Fernandes was enough to secure the win at the home of the New York Giants, despite Jarrod Bowen's consolation goal for the Hammers.",
      "Fernandes' impact was obvious, while the performance of new signing Matheus Cunha was encouraging. Kobbie Mainoo looked bright, too, but Amorim may have been happiest about the performance of a player he had worked with prior to joining United.",
      "It is fair to say the jury is still out on Manuel Ugarte after his first season at the club.",
      "The Uruguayan international joined United from PSG in a deal worth £50million but was largely inconsistent in his first season in England.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "The 24-year-old worked under Amorim at Sporting CP before moving to the French capital and his performances in Lisbon convinced les Parisiens to make their move.",
      "Ugarte established himself as one of the brightest young midfielders in Europe while playing under Amorim and the pair won a Portuguese League Cup together.",
      "As Amorim heads into his first full season in charge of United after some difficulties last term, he will hope Ugarte can be one of the players who can drive standards and establish his ideas in the dressing room.",
      "So his performance against West Ham last night would have encouraged Amorim, particularly how well he played alongside Mainoo at the base of midfield.",
      "One moment, particularly, suggested Ugarte was on song and would have pleased his manager heading into the new season.",
      "With United 1-0 up in the first half, Ugarte flew into a challenge with Guido Rodriguez when a loose ball presented itself in the West Ham half. He then nutmegged James Ward-Prowse before sliding a deft pass through to Amad.",
      "The Ivorian buried his effort past Alphonse Areola and although the goal was ruled out for offside, that one passage of play showed Ugarte at his best.",
      "After a mixed first season, if Ugarte can consistently show those qualities this term United may finally experience the benefits his £50million transfer was supposed to bring.",

      "New season, same old Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Yes, Ruben Amorim's first season in charge won't be judged on a pre-season win over West Ham United during a tour of the USA, but there were plenty of positives to emerge from their outing at the New York Giants' Met Life Stadium.",
      "Their performance would have pleased Amorim and so too would the two-goal contribution from captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Too often United had to rely on the brilliance of their skipper to pull them out of trouble and that was signified by the fact he scored 19 goals and registered 18 assists in one of United's most forgettable seasons for decades.",
      "If United are going to get back to the top, they need their captain to maintain that brilliant form this season. The key is for others to step up with meaningful contributions of their own.",
      "However, it had been though that Fernandes would be used in a deeper central midfield role this season, having largely impressed as one of Amorim's two attacking midfielders in his 3-4-2-1 formation last term.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo had been tipped to take those two roles this season but in the absence of Mbuemo, Fernandes lined up alongside Cunha in a more advanced role.",
      "And he showed his qualities, linking up with the Brazil international well, and offering Amorim some food for thought - particularly given Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo played well together at the base of midfield.",
      "Mbeumo will be introduced to the side in the coming days and weeks and it will be interesting to see what that means for Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal international has always offered versatility in where he is used in midfield and it is hard to imagine United won't team up Mbeumo and Cunha, who scored 37 goals between them last term, in the more advanced midfield roles.",
      "But Fernandes sent a timely reminder of what he can do there and with Mason Mount and Amad also options that can be used in those roles, Amorim suddenly has a number of options at his disposal.",
      "If the deeper Fernandes experiment doesn't work, Amorim won't hesitate to change his plan.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Monday, July 28.",
      "United were in action over the weekend with them starting their Premier League Summer Series with a 2-1 win over West Ham United. Captain Bruno Fernandes scored a brace before Jarrod Bowen pegged one back in the United States to maintain the Reds' unbeaten pre-season.",
      "Attention now turns back to the transfer window and two names that were in the headlines over the weekend were Benjamin Sesko and Gianluigi Donnarumma. Sesko is the latest striker linked with a move to Old Trafford while Donnarumma's contract situation at PSG has left United on high-alert.",
      "There's also the potential for some high-profile exits with Antony now close to securing a move to Saudi Arabia. Al Nassr are said to be the frontrunners to land the Brazilian.",
      "Take a look at all the United transfer news and views as we get it below.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani is set to be the subject of a bid from Man United in the coming days, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Juventus are also said to be monitoring the situation after having the striker on loan last season. Kolo Muani scored eight goals in 16 Serie A appearances.",
      "You may have missed it over the weekend but Luke Shaw has been tipped with a shock move out of Man United.",
      "The Sun have claimed that the defender is willing to listen to offers from Saudi Arabia amid uncertainty over his playing time under Ruben Amorim.",
      "German journalist Guido Schafer has claimed that Benjamin Sesko is open to a move to Man United despite the club having no European football to offer.",
      "It's claimed that Sesko would rather sign for United than Newcastle.",
      "Man United are reportedly going head-to-head with Brentford to sign Metz teenager Idrissa Gueye.",
      "The youngster scored five goals in 17 appearances in Ligue 2 and is wanted by some Premier League sides. Brentford are thought to be ready to offer him first-team football.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United hold an interest in signing Donnarumma in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Italian is understood to be at a stalemate with PSG over a new contract and United have shortlisted him as an option to bolster their goalkeepers.",
      "It is claimed that Donnarumma is ready to explore his options and PSG could be willing to sell him this summer as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "L’Equipe understands that PSG are looking to the future as they potentially hope to replace Donnarumma this summer.",
      "It is claimed that the French and European champions are eyeing a move for Lille’s promising shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "He would likely come in as PSG's new starter and there is a feeling that Chevalier could be the club's first choice even if Donnarumma decides to stay.",
      "According to our colleagues at Bristol Live, United's young goalkeeper Radek Vitek is set to leave the club.",
      "It is being reported that Vitek is of interest to Championship club Bristol City and the Robins are progressing with a deal.",
      "The deal is thought to be a season-long loan move and while the paperwork is not signed yet, it is believed to be on the verge of completion in the next few days.",
      "Hello and welcome to Monday's live Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "My name's Josh Holland I will be taking you today's latest news regarding United. Stay tuned and I'll bring you the latest from over the weekend and what's doing the rounds today.",
      "Tottenham have reportedly made contact over the potential signing of Kobbie Mainoo, according to Give Me Sport.",
      "After missing out on Morgan Gibbs-White, Spurs are said to be keen on landing Mainoo. The report states that informal enquiries have been made to see how difficult a move would be.",
      "Brazilian outlet Antenados have claimed that Antony has rejected a return to the country telling Botafogo and Sao Paulo that he is not considering a move back to Brazil just yet.",
      "The report adds that the forward thanked the two clubs for their approaches.",
      "Rashford has made his debut for Barcelona in their pre-season victory over Vissel Kobe.",
      "He came on at half-time and was replaced again in the 78th minute - not an uncommon practice in pre-season fixtures.",
      "Barca won 3-1 thanks to goals from Eric Garcia, Roony Bardghji and Pedro Fernandez.",
      "According to Foot Mercato, Al Nassr are interested in signing Antony this summer.",
      "It is understood the Saudi club have made an offer to United for the Brazilian.",
      "It has not been disclosed how much that offer was worth and whether or not Antony would be open to moving to the Middle East.",
      "Despite Antony being one of four players currently wanting out of United, Amorim has admitted that they may not depart if a suitable offer is not submitted.",
      "If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players. I know for a fact, these people, Omar, Jason and the club, have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand that clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition. If you want to play in the World Cup next year you need to play.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "According to Brazilian outlet Antenados, Antony has rejected two offers to return to his home country this summer.",
      "Botafogo and boyhood club Sao Paulo are both claimed to have made offers to the winger to return to South America.",
      "It is claimed that Antony appreciated those offers but did not feel that a move back to Brazil would be his best option at this stage of his career.",
      "Last season, the relationship between Watkins and Villa became testy when the forward was dropped in favour of United loanee Rashford.",
      "After making his return to the starting line-up, Watkins made his feelings clear.",
      "He's the manager at the end of the day and you've got to respect his decision, but I'm not one of those players that's happy to sit on the bench. I was fuming I wasn't playing and I let him know that.",
      "While MEN Sport understands that United have not made a formal offer for Watkins yet, it appears that the Reds will have competition to complete a move for him.",
      "The Daily Mail understands Newcastle have the Villa man on their watchlist this summer amid concerns that Isak could now leave them.",
      "We understand that Villa remain adamant that Watkins will not leave them this summer.",
      "United could be about to set off an entire transfer merry-go-round this summer in their bid to sign a new striker.",
      "La Gazzetta dello Sport, understand that if United, or another club, pip Juventus to the signing of Kolo Muani they will turn their attention to Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "It is thought the Turin club would want to sign the Dane on loan to strengthen their attack.",
      "Elaborating further on the links to Randal Kolo Muani, ESPN adds that PSG no longer want the forward after loaning him to Juventus for the second half of last season.",
      "Juve would want him back but currently are not in a position to afford him.",
      "The Frenchman has been offered to Premier League clubs. Chelsea are understood to have looked at him but preferred Delap and Pedro, Arsenal always wanted Gyokeres so it seems that United could be at the front of the queue potentially with Newcastle.",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, Sesko's agent Elvis Basanovic explained what clubs like United would need to do to convince his client to leave RB Leipzig.",
      "It’s not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko, but maybe it is right to clarify a few things. Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It’s him vs. him every day. We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn’t affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers. That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club — a special project with a special coach.",
      "According to ESPN, there are three strikers currently on United's radar as they look to bolster their attack.",
      "Watkins, Kolo-Muani and Vlahovic are thought to be on the Reds' watchlist.",
      "However, it is also understood that United will have to sell a striker for one to come in with all eyes being on either Hojlund or Zirkzee to make way.",
      "L’Equipe understands that PSG are looking to the future as they potentially hope to replace Donnarumma this summer.",
      "It is claimed that the French and European champions are eyeing a move for Lille’s promising shot-stopper Lucas Chevalier.",

      "It is claimed that Donnarumma is ready to explore his options and PSG could be willing to sell him this summer as he enters the final year of his contract.",
      "On Saturday, Kobbie Mainoo returned to the stadium where he announced himself to the world.",
      "Mainoo was just 18 when he started against Arsenal at the MetLife Stadium in July 2023, and that summer preceded an outstanding breakout campaign for the Stockport-born midfielder.",
      "During that tour of the United States, it was obvious Manchester United had a supremely talented young player on their hands. Mainoo looked unfazed playing in front of 82,500 fans and his laid-back nature endeared him to Erik ten Hag, who had no qualms about playing him in the Premier League.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Speaking to Football Insider, football finance expert Dr Dan Plumley has explained how the delay in signing Mbeumo due to negotiations with Brentford, could impact the Reds moving forward.",
      "He claims that had the deal been done in June, United would have been in a stronger position financially.",
      "The PSR caveat is important within this and what the Premier League do next. But if you look at the context of when clubs make those transfers, if it is at the start of a new year PSR-wise, you are baking in that cost for the year, which you know is going to impact the bottom line. And then you’ve got how that fits with the three-year rolling period. You do know as a club where you’re setting your sights because you are committing to that cost, and of course, if you then add more players this summer, then you are adding to that cost for this year. Sometimes you’ll see clubs work on three-year transfer cycles as well. United have been a little bit more volatile. It still appears to me that they need to get a couple off the books. And of course, they want to get a couple off the books.",
      "Speaking to MUTV post-match, Amorim confirmed that Mbeumo would not be featuring against Bournemouth in the next match of the Reds' Premier League Series.",
      "He explained:",
      "He is not going to play the next one (vs Bournemouth). We hope to have Bryan in the last game (vs Everton). He is training now, so we will see.",
      "MORE HERE",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through until lunchtime with all the latest Reds news.",
      "We are going to kick things off with reaction to the victory over West Ham at MetLife and what Amorim had to say about Mbeumo's impending debut..."

      "It was easy to miss but Ruben Amorim might have just aimed a subtle dig at Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Amorim was asked about his new signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while out on the tour of the US, and said: “They are really humble. They know how to fit into a group, they don’t act like stars.",
      "\"They also understand that this is not the moment to want to be a star. They are team players at the same time. But it's not just what they give to the team, it's the way they make the feel with their teammates, so they are improving this team in every aspect.\"",
      "Amorim produced that answer during an interview with MUTV ahead of Manchester United's game against West Ham in New Jersey. The clip has gained some traction, but a lot of supporters won't have seen it.",
      "United's head coach is a good communicator. His comments could be taken at face value, but it felt like he was sending a message to the players who have crossed him at Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both dropped for the Manchester derby in December. Rashford recently moved to Barcelona on loan and Garnacho is set to leave.",
      "Amorim outlined his vision for the dressing room when he appeared to have a dig at Rashford and Garnacho during his interview in the States. The United head coach wants elite players and stars in the dressing room - just not at the expense of the team.",
      "Building a healthy culture is crucial to building a successful team and Amorim wants the right personalities in his dressing room, which is why Rashford and Garnacho have been kicked out.",
      "Erik ten Hag improved standards during his two-and-a-half-year reign and took on Cristiano Ronaldo. Amorim isn't stupid and has quickly decided Rashford and Garnacho cannot be part of his squad.",
      "Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Amorim suggested he would be open to reintegrating members of the 'bomb squad', but that felt like a deliberate ploy to protect players' value.",
      "Amorim has moved on with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. The 40-year-old is delighted with United's new additions because they are brilliant players with the character needed to thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "United don't have room in their squad for players who criticise the manager's section calls or walk straight down the tunnel after being substituted.",
      "Those are just two of the issues Amorim encountered with Garnacho during his nine months in Manchester.",

      "Following confirmation of his move to Arsenal on Saturday night, Viktor Gyokeres will no longer be linked with Manchester United.",
      "The Swede had been linked with a move to Old Trafford over the last few months amid United's desperate need for a striker in this summer's transfer window.",
      "Having excelled under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, many believed it was inevitable he would end up reuniting with him in M16.",
      "However, United never tabled an offer for the striker. As a result, they are still looking for a proven goalscorer to complement the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "With just three weeks to go until the start of the new Premier League season, time is running out for United to find the goalscorer they are looking for.",
      "Although Amorim has publicly said he would be \"happy\" to start the season without a new striker at the tip of his attack, the feeling is probably different behind closed doors.",
      "Having spent more than £120million on Cunha and Mbeumo, United need to raise funds via player sales to continue their recruitment drive. The aforementioned duo are statement signings and United will want a No.9 of the same mould.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United have been chasing shadows in their striker search. They have been linked with countless names but they are still waiting to make a breakthrough.",
      "If United are to follow the same blueprint in their search for a striker that led them to Mbeumo and Cunha, they are likely to target a goalscorer with Premier League pedigree. However, Premier League proven strikers are not cheap.",
      "However, in a summer in which failing to sign a striker will be costly, United might not be left with any choice but to loosen their purse strings one last time.",
      "If that proves to be the case, they should be setting their sights on Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta. He enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, helping Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "The 28-year-old was one of the best strikers in the Premier League last term, scoring 14 league goals, two of which were scored against United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Frenchman has made solid progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz, initially on loan, four-and-a-half years ago, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he required time to adapt, so much so it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to consistently show his class.",
      "Scoring 19 times in 2023/24, Mateta has scored 36 goals in the last two seasons for Palace. Of those 36 goals, 30 were plundered in the Premier League, meaning he has an established record in England's top flight.",
      "Mateta ticks plenty of boxes. He is a defender's worst nightmare, both with the ball at his feet and in the air.",
      "After Palace triggered the 12-month option in his contract last December to extend his stay at Selhurst Park until June 2027, they have ensured they have protected his value. His deal was originally due to expire next June.",
      "Despite that, Palace may be mindful that this summer could represent their last chance to get the best possible price for their chief goal-getter.",
      "If they fail to tie him down to a new deal within the next 12 months, clubs will try and land him for a cut-price fee next summer amid the fact he will have just one year left on his contract.",
      "Palace will be accounting for plenty of factors this summer, and keeping Mateta will be a priority for them. He is their main striker and losing him would be a massive blow.",
      "But as United have demonstrated with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo, they still have plenty of pulling power. Palace's demotion to the Europa Conference League from the Europa League could also play into United's hands.",
      "There is no denying Mateta will cost a hefty fee this summer, but Palace might be prepared to negotiate amid the possibility their grip on his future this time next year could be weaker.",

The Cameroon international joins Matheus Cunha in completing a move to Old Trafford as they now prepare for the new Premier League season, which gets underway next month.",
      "United have more than a month to go until the summer transfer window closes on September 1. Between now and then, there are likely to be plenty of rumours about who United may or may not sign before the window closes.",
      "A report in Give Me Sport has claimed that United star Kobbie Mainoo is a target for Tottenham Hotspur this summer.",
      "It has been reported that Spurs have identified Mainoo as a target after missing out on signing Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest.",
      "The report claims that Tottenham will look to take advantage of Mainoo's contract situation remaining unresolved, with the midfielder's current deal running until the summer of 2027.",
      "MEN Sport says: Mainoo is one of the most talented prospects at United and is destined for a bright future at Old Trafford. The contract uncertainty is unsurprisingly leading to speculation around his future, so United would be wise to get a new deal wrapped up as soon as possible.",
      "United are once again being linked with a move for Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "According to La Gazzetta dello Sport, United will look to provide competition to Juventus for the signing of Kolo Muani this summer.",
      "The France international spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus, who are reportedly interested in re-signing the striker on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "MEN Sport says: United have been linked with several strikers already this summer, and Kolo Muani is one of the players credited as a potential target in recent weeks. Only time will tell if United will make an active attempt to sign Kolo Muani, but it seems that they may find it difficult to fend off competition from Juventus.",

      "We are now into the business end of the summer transfer window in which clubs are running out of time to get their remaining deals done in time for the start of the new season.",
      "Manchester United kick-off their Premier League campaign in less than three weeks' time against Arsenal (August 17). Between now and that curtain raiser at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim faces a race against time to get additional reinforcements through the door.",
      "However, the likelihood of United strengthening in attack, midfield and between the posts before that seems highly unlikely. A move to sign a new striker is the priority at the moment with the possibility of signing a new midfielder and goalkeeper outside dreams before the window closes.",
      "The window is open for another month with deadline day falling on Monday, September 1 (7pm). By then, United would have played three Premier League matches and participated in the EFL Cup. And, despite already splashing over £120million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, there is still more work to be done.",
      "\"I think our club in the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player,\" Amorim said last week. \"So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy. Because all the players that are here want to be here.",
      "\"And that, for me, is the most important thing. And Matheus and Bryan... Also Diego [Leon]. But Diego is a different situation. He is a potential player. But with Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "Despite Amorim's insistence that he would be \"happy\" to go into the new campaign with his current squad, United continue to be linked with players on a consistent basis. Below, MEN Sport takes a look at what steps are required to take this window as a good one to a perfect one.",
      "Unsurprisingly, a striker is the department that is most pressing. Rasmus Hojlund is the only current senior number nine at the club with Joshua Zirkee appearing to be better suited to playing deeper and Chido Obi still only 17.",
      "Benjamin Sesko appears to be one of the leading candidates to move to Old Trafford after Arsenal went for Viktor Gyokeres. Liam Delap, Victor Osimhen and Dusan Vlahovic have all been mentioned as candidates, but Sesko's low £60million valuation makes him one of the frontrunners.",
      "Newcastle United, who themselves have had a difficult time throughout the window, are also keen, but it's been claimed that the RB Leipzig star still prefers a move to United. At £60million, United would be getting a complete forward going into his prime years.",
      "For United's window to be a successful one, then their player sale movement must gather pace. Marcus Rashford and his wages are off the books, but Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia all remain at the club.",
      "Sancho and Antony appear to be the most likely to depart first - with Juventus and Al-Nassr pushing for respective moves. Should United secure permanent exits for the pair, it would put them in a good place. Garnacho is expected to be the biggest sale of the lot with a fee of around £50million touted.",
      "In a dream scenario, United will raise close to £100million - at least - via player sales with the club also expected to be open to selling Casemiro, Luke Shaw and Hojlund.",
      "As a result of further player sales, it would be anticipated to see a new goalkeeper brought in. Andre Onana's injury has left Amorim short and even with the Cameroonian fit, it's likely that a new number one will be pursued - but for the right price only.",
      "Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens is thought to be on their radar, but Gianluigi Donnarumma is a name that would instantly strengthen the goalkeeping department. The PSG number one has just 12 months left on his current deal, and is yet to put pen to paper to new terms.",
      "The European champions are closing in on signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille - meaning Donnarumma's time in Paris is now approaching its conclusion. Still only 26, Donnarumma is in his prime and should be a goalkeeper that United are all over.",
      "Finally, while this is looking at a dream scenario for United, let's throw in another midfielder. It's a position that splits opinion among many and one that could do with more firepower.",
      "Douglas Luiz wants to return to the Premier League, Wilfred Ndidi is available for just £9million, and wildcard option Corentin Tolisso have been considered. However, after missing out on Geovany Quenda and Gyokeres, Amorim could raid Sporting CP to reunite with Morten Hjulmand.",
      "The Denmark international has earned a good reputation of being a terrific all-rounder in midfielder and he would compliment the current options at the club. Like Sesko, Hjulmand won't come cheap, but it would make Amorim's midfield better and add more security.",

      "A week on, another Portuguese-speaker played a pass for Rasmus Hojlund and the ball eluded him. This time the reaction was different.",
      "Hojlund offered Matheus Cunha applause for his overhit forward pass moments before half-time. Cunha cursed his execution, particularly as he had engineered space with a deft turn that wowed the crowd in New Jersey.",
      "In Stockholm a week earlier, Hojlund vented at Diogo Dalot for delaying a pass. Within a minute of kick-off in New Jersey, he was played through by Cunha and smacked the post.",
      "With Cunha and Bruno Fernandes to support Hojlund, he was unlikely to be short of service. United were productive and the 1-0 half-time scoreline flattered West Ham. The issue was the goal was a fifth-minute penalty and United's chance-conversion from open play was familiarly poor.",
      "Hojlund had two shots, Leny Yoro nodded wide and Fernandes hit goalkeeper Alphonse Areola when he seemed certain to hit the back of the net. Fernandes rectified that quickly with a classy second in the 52nd minute.",
      "This was hardly a case of Fernandes papering over the cracks again. United were so energetic their starting XI played for over an hour, unheard of for their first pre-season tour match.",
      "After the rotational team that was fielded against Leeds United in Sweden, Ruben Amorim used his maiden tour match to set out his stall now the players have banked nearly three weeks of training. The starters played for 65 minutes, a striking shift from the opening tour games under Erik ten Hag when players were allocated 45 minutes.",
      "Amorim's first tour XI could feasibly line up against Arsenal in three weeks. Bryan Mbeumo, deemed not match-fit due to his arrival time from Brentford, will doubtless muscle his way in and Andre Onana is hopeful of recovering in time for the competitive schedule.",
      "It was a travesty the scoreline was 2-1 when United's first XI earned a breather midway through the second half. Amorim picked six players bought over the last year, supplemented by integral players for the long-term. United had a newish look even with only one new signing.",
      "The glaring issue in the team remains the striker. Hojlund's desperation for a goal was evident from his edgy body language and he headed off the pitch without a goal to his name for the second successive week.",
      "After two early sighters, Hojlund was on the fringes and United fans were treated to the familiar sight of Fernandes placing the ball between the sticks. It is early days but United cannot get by another season with Fernandes topping the goalscoring charts.",
      "Hojlund scored nine minutes into last season's Stateside tour before he hit the deck with a hamstring injury against Arsenal. A sliding doors moment before the season began. This was another. He was almost on the scoresheet inside a minute.",
      "Running onto Cunha's through ball, Hojlund effortlessly outpaced Max Kilman and thudded the upright with a first-time shot. United only had to wait a few more minutes to change the scoreboard through Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes and Cunha warmed up with each other. United lack quantity and quality in midfield, an area where Fernandes could paper over the cracks. Yet Amorim indicated at his pre-match press conference that he was loath to permanently relocate Fernandes to a deeper role, having admitted that the captain is developing a \"connection\" with Cunha.",
      "Whether as a duo behind the striker or one in front of the other, there is a growing rapport between the two Latinos just two starts into Cunha's career at United. But Mbeumo has to be accommodated somewhere.",
      "Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, the two teenagers in the team, are developing into attacking assets from defence. Heaven won the penalty and Yoro found Fernandes with a pass from inside his own third. Heaven erred when he failed to close down Jarrod Bowen and the angle for West Ham's goal.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was the talk of the town as a teenager at the MetLife two years ago when United beat Arsenal. He was starting again, this time to regain his place rather than gain it.",
      "Having been trialled as a playmaker by Amorim and, fruitlessly, as a false nine, Mainoo was back in central midfield with Manuel Ugarte, a certain starter next month on the basis of United's substantial investment in the Uruguayan. A day after Amorim admitted he is pushing Mainoo to increase his rhythm and pace, Mainoo assisted Fernandes by winning the ball deep inside West Ham territory.",
      "Ugarte reserved his best United performance this calendar year for a friendly and the challenge will be for him to transmit this level to a meaningful match. Ugarte's intensity would have befitted a Premier League match.",
      "Diogo Dalot has had a squad number upgrade to '2' yet Amad is poised to occupy the right wing in this United reboot. The 23-year-old had a goal chalked off after he strayed offside.",
      "It was another Portuguese-speaker who got on the scoresheet.",

      "Amorim played Mainoo as a playmaker and trialled him up front in the 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in February but the 20-year-old could return to central midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The United head coach admitted on Friday he is urging Mainoo to improve his \"rhythm and pace\" and the England international was restored to the starting XI, having been picked on the bench against Leeds United in Stockholm last week.",
      "Fernandes got both of United's goals against West Ham, having rejected an offer from a Saudi Pro League club to leave in the summer. It was while discussing his impact on the team that Amorim enthused about Mainoo's performance.",
      "\"You can see it in the assists, the goals,\" Amorim said of Fernandes. \"Not just that. I think now he has more players. I felt that in the tour. I felt that now there are more players to help them to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "\"But he's our leader, so it's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He lives by example. He works really hard. Always available. Sometimes he plays with pain.",
      "\"The problem is sometimes he gets frustrated and sometimes he loses a little bit the focus of his job. Sometimes he wants to help so much his teammates that sometimes it's not the best thing to do.",
      "\"They have to learn. They have to do their job. Bruno has to wait for the ball in different situations. This kind of thing is a leader, but he needs help. And he's going to have help.",
      "\"He has a function or a position for every game. It's impossible to play all the positions. Last year I felt that sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and then we missed Bruno near the box. I think with different characteristics, with Cunha, with Bryan, I really like Kobbie's game. I think he (Fernandes) will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot. Maybe in the sprint he's a different player, but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance. He's smart. So it's not about that.",
      "\"I spoke about that against Leeds because I felt like everybody in the midfield, the pace was not there. Today it was there. Manuel and Kobbie did that job.",
      "\"The physicality of Bruno is not the concern. He's ready for the physicality, playing deep or as a midfielder.\"",

      "Manchester United have been handed a major transfer hint regarding Benjamin Sesko, with Ruben Amorim's side believed to be keeping the striker on their radar.",
      "The club have already made two statement signings this summer in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, with both players costing just over £120m combined.",
      "Despite the heavy spend, United continue to be linked with further big moves in the summer transfer window. Sesko has been on United's radar for the past few years, and it looks like the 22-year-old striker could be moving clubs ahead of next season.",
      "Amorim's team had wanted to sign Liam Delap in June but ultimately lost the battle to Chelsea. With Rasmus Hojlund likely to leave the club this summer, a striker looks to be on United's radar, despite the Portuguese boss telling media on Friday that he was happy to start the season without a fresh centre-forward.",
      "Arsenal chose to sign Viktor Gyokeres over Sesko, and Newcastle United have now made their interest in the Slovenian clear with Alexander Isak's future in jeopardy. With a series of options open to Sesko, his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has revealed where the 22-year-old would be willing to go.",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, he said: “It’s not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko, but maybe it is right to clarify a few things. Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It’s him vs. him every day.",
      "“We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn’t affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers. That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club — a special project with a special coach.”",
      "In regards to 'special projects', United and Newcastle are both in difficult phases at the moment. The Reds have no European football next season and finished 15th last campaign.",
      "Newcastle, on the other hand, look to be at risk of losing a series of star players. Isak is heavily linked with a move to Liverpool, and Valentino Livramento could be going to Manchester City - the club who the Magpies also lost James Trafford to this summer.",
      "RB Leipzig are reportedly looking for a £70m fee for Sesko. If Newcastle do sell Isak, they are sure to have those finances. It is unclear if United are willing to spend that much money on the 22-year-old Slovenian.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim could be in the midst of a nightmare transfer scenario after claims that Antony has already rejected two exit routes from Old Trafford.",
      "Erik ten Hag signed Antony in his first transfer window at the club, but his form was often not up to the required standard despite the ex-United manager's insistence on picking him. When the Dutchman was sacked in October 2024, it was the beginning of the end for the Brazilian who struggled to adapt to Amorim's new system.",
      "Antony was subsequently loaned to Real Betis in the January transfer window and managed to excel. The winger rediscovered his form in Seville and helped the La Liga club return to the Europa League and reach the final of the Conference League.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester, Antony informed the club that he wished to depart this summer. That stance was echoed by Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Barcelona's new loanee Marcus Rashford.",
      "Unsurprisingly, Betis have been heavily linked with the forward this summer - and have stated openly that they would like to bring Antony back to their club. However, they have also stated that the deal would have to make financial sense for them, too.",
      "From the 25-year-old's perspective, it seems that he is also keen on a return to Betis, while his priority also seems to be staying in Europe. This has been emphasised by reports in Brazilian media outlet Antenados - who claim that Botafogo and boyhood club Sao Paulo have both been rejected by Antony.",
      "It is claimed the winger was grateful and appreciative for the offer, but that he sees his future remaining in Europe for the time being and not back in his home country. This news comes after Amorim explained this week that those wishing to leave may remain at Old Trafford if a suitable bid is not submitted.",
      "\"If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join the team because they are our players,\" the Portuguese head coach said. \"I know for a fact, these people, Omar [Berrada], Jason [Wilcox] and the club, have a number for these players.",
      "\"If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand that clubs are waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players, they have more competition, more competition. If you want to play in the World Cup next year you need to play.\"",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a shock transfer swoop for PSG goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma, as his future in France was left in doubt this weekend.",
      "Since David de Gea's exit - under Erik ten Hag - United have struggled with their goalkeeper options. Andre Onana was signed to revolutionise the manner in which the team built from the back.",
      "However, short distribution has been a rarity and the Cameroon No.1 has been criticised for his mistakes. That has fuelled speculation that United could be looking to bring in a new first choice shot stopper into the squad.",
      "L'Equipe understands that United and Manchester City have shown their interest in bringing the Italian to their clubs after talks between PSG and their shot stopper stalled. With Donnarumma heading into the last year of his contract, and a replacement in the form of Lille's Lucas Chevalier prepared, PSG are willing to sell him this summer to regain some of their money.",
      "From United's perspective, a would-be move for Donnarumma would be a huge expense for them when they also need to strengthen up their attack. But should they manage to find the money for him, they could provide him with his dream shirt number.",
      "Donnarumma currently wears the No.1 shirt - which belongs to Altay Bayindir - but the arrival of a new goalkeeper would likely force the Turkey goalkeeper to consider his options. If that were the case, then the Italian would likely be handed the No.1 shirt as Onana has no desire to wear it.",
      "A more rogue option, and one which is currently available, is the No.99 shirt. He wore that for several seasons with AC Milan and even briefly at PSG, too, before inheriting the No.1 jersey.",
      "Should Bayindir still be at the club when Donnarumma (potentially) arrives, picking the No.99 would likely endear himself to his new teammates. But, there is still a lot that needs to happen before the 26-year-old becomes a Red, if he does so at all.",

      "Manchester United have been told they need to complete a 'couple' of sales to avoid a breach of the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) for the 2025/26 season.",
      "Since taking control of United's football project in February 2024, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has stressed the importance of working frugally to avoid sanctions from the Premier League. However, he has come under fire for perceived financial mistakes, particularly in the case of giving Erik ten Hag another summer transfer window only to sack him in October and the disastrous appointment and subsequent split with Dan Ashworth.",
      "Heading into the 2025/26 season, there has been a push from United supporters and critics for the club to bring in new players and refresh their team. Last season was one to forget for the Reds and the lack of Champions League football this coming year has hindered Ruben Amorim's ability to complete deals.",
      "Despite this, they have made a few good signings in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Matheus Cunha. However, football finance expert and senior lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, Dr Dan Plumley, has told Football Insider that the Reds need to make sales to balance their books.",
      "\"The PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) caveat is important within this and what the Premier League do next,\" he told Football Insider. \"But if you look at the context of when clubs make those transfers, if it is at the start of a new year PSR-wise, you are baking in that cost for the year, which you know is going to impact the bottom line.",
      "\"And then you’ve got how that fits with the three-year rolling period. You do know as a club where you’re setting your sights because you are committing to that cost, and of course, if you then add more players this summer, then you are adding to that cost for this year.",
      "\"Sometimes you’ll see clubs work on three-year transfer cycles as well. United have been a little bit more volatile.",
      "\"It still appears to me that they need to get a couple off the books. And of course, they want to get a couple off the books.",
      "\"I think if you’re looking at the here and now and what happens between now and the transfer window closing, if they are going to go out and sign more players, there’s probably going to have to be a couple that leave to offset that.\" The priority for Amorim will be to find new clubs for the players who requested their departures from Old Trafford earlier this summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford has already completed a loan move to Barcelona but four of his teammates currently remain at Old Trafford despite wanting to leave. Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho all want out of the club but Amorim stated this week that he would be open to reintegrating those players if no suitable bids were put forward.",

      "If the Red Devils were to ‘snatch Muani from PSG’ for the €50m asking price then Man Utd ‘would willingly compensate’ Juventus by sending Hojlund to Turin.",
      "It is understood that PSG ‘legitimately want to cash in on a player they paid €93 million from Eintracht in 2023’ and Corriere dello Sport adds that ‘the player, among other things, is Juventus’s first ally in this complex negotiation: at PSG, he reiterated, even in the last few hours, his desire to continue with [Igor] Tudor.’",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils definitely need to get a deal for a striker over the line despite deals for Cunha and Mbeumo, with Watkins his preference.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked out their ‘next big target’ after landing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "So far this summer, the Red Devils have only managed to make three signings as they have spent around £130m to sign Mbeumo, Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim would presumably have liked to have more players through the door by now, but a lack of outgoing players has impacted United’s transfer plans.",
      "Marcus Rashford is the only member of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ to leave this summer as he has joined Barcelona on loan with an option to buy, while Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain contracted to the Premier League giants.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are great signings, but Man Utd still need upgrades in various positions. Recent reports have indicated that their next priorities are to sign a goalkeeper and a striker.",
      "READ: Manchester United keep or sell: Amorim to offload Hojlund alongside Garnacho, Sancho, Antony",
      "United are understood to be in the market for a new goalkeeper after Andre Onana suffered a dramatic decline during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "Onana became a liability last season and there are better goalkeepers available, with recent reports claiming the Red Devils are plotting an audacious move for PSG star Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The 26-year-old is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and he sparkled for PSG as they won the Champions League in 2024/25, but his future is in doubt as he has entered the final year of his current contract.",
      "Last week, a report from Caught Offside claimed PSG will sell Donnarumma this summer as they are yet to come to terms on a new deal.",
      "The report revealed:",
      "‘Sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Gianluigi Donnarumma is one of the top names on Manchester United’s shortlist.",
      "‘PSG have been negotiating with him for over a year on a new contract. Donnarumma earns €7 million net salary plus €3 million in bonuses, but the club’s offer didn’t satisfy him. He has decided not to renew his deal, and with only one year left on his contract, PSG have decided to sell him this summer.’",
      "Now, Caught Offside have added that United have decided to make a new goalkeeper their ‘next big target’ and while Porto’s Diogo Costa remains an option, Donnarumma is a ‘coveted prize’ on their ‘shortlist’.",
      "It is claimed that this move will hinge on Onana leaving, while PSG have Lille star Lucas Chevalier ‘successor lined up’.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘United have placed a price tag of £35-40 million on the Cameroonian international, and there is growing openness to his sale. Clubs in capitals such as AS Monaco and Saudi Arabia have shown interest, though Onana’s decision will significantly impact the final outcome.",
      "‘Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has become a coveted prize on United’s shortlist. The Italian has expressed dissatisfaction with PSG’s contract extension, which includes reduced salary and bonus-based incentives.’",
      "On Chevalier, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed on Sunday that the £35m star has already ‘agreed terms’ with PSG.",
      "He tweeted: ‘Paris Saint-Germain have agreed personal terms with Lucas Chevalier.",
      "‘Talks ongoing with Lille as request starts from €40m (£35m), as L’Équipe reported.",
      "‘PSG start moving as they still can not agree new deal with Gigio Donnarumma.’",
      "Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly ‘decided to sell’ a ‘top name’ on Manchester United’s ‘shortlist’ to replace a current starter at Old Trafford.",
      "Man City have made a ‘concrete move’ to sign a Chelsea target but ‘want to keep’ Ederson despite the goalkeeper agreeing personal terms with Galatasaray.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly doing “everything they can” to stop a Manchester City target from looking to leave the club this summer.",
      "Man Utd have launched a surprise bid to convince Italy and Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma to move to Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Manchester City are interested in replacing Ederson with Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are plotting an incredible move for the PSG star, whose ‘continuity is in doubt’ following what he said after his Arsenal heroics."

      "Man Utd are set to discuss a potential deal to sign Benjamin Sesko in a meeting with Ruben Amorim next week, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Red Devils have already completed the attacking signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has also joined.",
      "Man Utd are still looking to make at least three more signings, according to reports, with a centre-forward, defensive midfielder and goalkeeper on their list of priorities.",
      "RB Leipzig’s Sesko and Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins have emerged as two of the most mentioned options to improve their attack but it is currently unclear who they will make a concrete move for.",
      "And transfer expert Romano has revealed that Man Utd “will discuss” a potential move for Sesko next week with Amorim as a deal could become “expensive”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Next week will be important, very important for the future of Benjamin Sesko. Newcastle are going very big with a contract proposal ready for the player and they are also ready to approach RB Leipzig. Newcastle are going very strong and are prepared to make important things happen for the Slovenian striker. They will go big next week.",
      "READ: Manchester United keep or sell: Amorim to offload Hojlund alongside Garnacho, Sancho, Antony",
      "“Manchester United are still discussing Benjamin Sesko internally. It is an expensive deal, so it is not easy, but don’t forget the gentleman’s agreement I told you. For some clubs, indicated by Benjamin Sesko as ‘special clubs’ for him, the price of the package can be €70m to €80m fixed, €5m to €10m in add-ons. It can be an important factor.",
      "“With Newcastle going very big and Manchester United discussing strikers and Sesko internally. Keep an eye on this story in the next week, in the next days. Newcastle will go with a big proposal, Manchester United will discuss his name again with the coach involved in the conversation, with the directors to see if they can make it happen or not.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand reckons the Red Devils would be better off with a more experienced striker than Sesko after their struggles with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Ferdinand explained on his YouTube channel: “I think you’ve got to look at the here and now at the moment with Man Utd. That’s what I said about a number nine. I’m not really doubting [Sesko] as a player. I’m saying Man Utd need experience at the top of the pitch.",
      "“They’ve got Hojlund, they’ve got Zirkzee, they’ve got Chido. Young, inexperienced players. They need someone to look at and go, ‘That’s how you play as a number nine.’ That’s how you do it. When you’re going to buy somebody who hasn’t got as much experience as I’d like, I think that’s another risk. Is it worth taking with inexperienced players at this level?”",
      "After taking Mbuemo off Brentford’s hands in the summer, The Sun now claim that Man Utd could ‘hijack’ the Bees’ deal to sign young Metz forward Idrissa Gueye.",
      "Man Utd and Burnley have now ‘joined the hunt’ for the 18-year-old with the competition forcing Brentford to ‘now look at matching his French club’s £15m asking price’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Brentford can offer Gueye a chance at early Premier League football, while United only see him as a long-term project.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have set a deadline to offload Alejandro Garnacho following fresh ‘private talks’ over his future at Old Trafford.",

      "He returns to a team managed by Amorim, not Ten Hag, with whom he publicly fell out, but a change in manager isn’t enough to save his United career. Sancho’s best position might be in one of the wide 10 roles behind the striker, but it’s unlikely that he’ll get the chance to prove it.",
      "Juventus are the club most keen on signing Sancho this summer, but the winger’s salary is proving to be a huge stumbling block. There’s no doubt that he needs to take a wage cut if he wants to play regularly for any team in 2025/26.",

      "His time in Spain was fruitful for him and United, who are delighted that the winger’s value has risen from around £15m to at least double that. Selling an £80m signing for £30m will be painful, but that’s still a helpful fee as the club’s centre-forward search goes on.",

United want a huge £60m for the Argentine, which is wildly unrealistic. Regardless, head coach Amorim says the club will stand firm with their valuation, and if he isn’t sold, he’ll be welcomed back into the first team. Sure he will.",
      "Whatever the Red Devils receive for Garnacho will be deemed pure profit, which has become highly valued under current PSR rules. Despite what Amorim has said, we can see the 21-year-old leaving for closer to £45m at the end of August.",
      "",

      "He’s only 22, so selling now might come back to bite United on the arse. Giving him fresh surroundings for a year while Amorim and Ratcliffe try to clean an almighty mess could be perfect for Hojlund, who desperately needs confidence and a chance to prove he’s good enough to be United’s long-term No.9.",

      "19) 🔽 Morgan Gibbs-White – Nottingham Forest to Tottenham\nOh, Spurs. Got the here we go treatment from Romano before Forest pulled the plug and threatened legal action against Spurs for knowing the player’s release clause, and now according to Ornstein is all set for a new deal at his current club. A deal that presumably includes an even more super secret release clause that specifically states Spurs can’t activate it.",
      "",
      "18) Malick Fofana – Lyon to Everton\nFabrizio says ‘advanced talks’ but Everton making a high-profile attempt to sign a Liverpool target just feels like something destined to end in pain just because that’s the way of the world.",
      "",
      "17) Luke Shaw – Manchester United to Saudi\nThis hasn’t reached the stage yet of a suitor being named but reports suggest Shaw has seen the writing on the wall for his United career and he’s willing to make the best of it by taking the Saudi coin. Sadly, Ruben Amorim will have taken the view that Shaw’s fitness cannot be relied upon, and he is now well-stocked for left wing-backs. There is no urgency here – it could be one for January.",

      "16) Javi Guerra – Valencia to Manchester United\nUnited are ready to get a deal done quickly, apparently, at around £20million for the Spain Under-21 midfielder who has just rejected Valencia’s latest offer of a contract renewal. Reports suggest Guerra is hoping for a better offer from Valencia so this could simply be a case of his representatives using United and the oldest trick in the agents’ book.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nSesko seemed to be going nowhere while Leipzig were demanding in excess of £75million but in news sure to grind Arsenal’s gears, reports in Germany suggest that demand could have fallen to £59million, which would make the Slovenian much more appealing to United.",
      "",
      "14) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £50m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "12) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Nothing on Isak, mind…",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "8) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent has been in Turin this week to attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and he is the first on their list should Isak get his wish.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Viktor Gyokeres is in London, which means Arsenal can ramp up their pursuit of the Palace star, which they intend to do…",
      "",
      "5) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool wouldn’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, though £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, with Diaz keen to make it happen. Bayern will return with an improved offer but the player may have to do his bit too since Liverpool are insistent on doing it their way. The latest: the two clubs are ‘in dialogue’, while Diaz was left out of Liverpool’s squad for Saturday’s pre-season friendly defeat to Milan.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "3)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe didn’t think this done just because Newcastle had told Liverpool that Isak was not for sale. Their stance hasn’t changed – but everything else has after Isak agitated for a move. If only he had done it sooner, Liverpool might not have spent the money on Hugo Ekitike, who might have filled the Isak void at Newcastle. Instead, the expectation is the pair will team up at Anfield. It won’t happen quick – Newcastle are determined to dig in and their worst-case scenario has to involve a British transfer record fee – but it’ll probably happen.",
      "",
      "2)🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThe Netherlands defender’s agent is quite open about talks that have taken place with Chelsea, who have also been in touch with Ajax. Hato has been linked with Liverpool, Arsenal and Real Madrid, but he’s apparently already ‘said yes’ to Chelsea, who seem intent on getting to the teenager first. Hato was left out of the Ajax squad for Thursday night’s friendly against Celtic in Como.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect.",

      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "These are good signings for the Red Devils, but they still have loads to do after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "The lack of outgoings is hindering their hopes of securing their remaining top targets, with United’s priority to sign a striker and a goalkeeper.",
      "These positions were weak areas for Ruben Amorim‘s side in 2024/25 as Ramus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee only scored seven Premier League goals between them, while Andre Onana suddenly became a liability as his form dramatically declined.",

      "The 26-year-old is among the standout goalkeepers in Europe, but his long-term future is in doubt as he has entered the final year of his contract.",

He has decided not to renew his deal, and with only one year left on his contract, PSG have decided to sell him this summer.’",

      "Either Newcastle United will be targeting a player similar to Alexander Isak if he leaves for Liverpool, or the Reds might be looking for another alternative to the Swede even after signing Hugo Ekitike, especially when they realise he is the worst finisher in Europe.",
      "Newcastle have been linked with Benjamin Sesko but FBRef’s statistical models claim these are the closest 10 players to Isak across Europe’s big five leagues.",
      "We take a look and wonder whether Liverpool or Newcastle might be interested, or maybe even Manchester United; they need a striker more than anybody.",
      "",
      "10) Kylian Mbappe (Real Madrid)\nWe start with a player obviously very attainable. A ridiculous player with ridiculous statistics. Didn’t help Real Madrid win any trophies last season though, did he?In all seriousness, Liverpool really did come relatively close to signing the Frenchman, who apparently agreed to join the Reds three years ago for £169m. But PSG wanted a world-record fee, just two years before losing him for nowt.",
      "And now Liverpool are briefing the media that they think they have signed a player with Mbappe-like potential in Ekitike. Even better than the real thing?",
      "",
      "9) Vinicius Jnr (Real Madrid)\nThis is why Real Madrid are not in the market for Isak; they already have two pretty good clones. And with the Brazilian’s price being in the £300m-plus bracket, the only suitors are likely to come from the Middle East. Remember when Vinicius being a target for Manchester United was briefly A Thing? Good times.",
      "",
      "8) Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nWe took the pee out of Liverpool’s attempts to brush over the fact that the Frenchman has a poor goalscoring record but he was probably the very closest they could sign to Isak in terms of style, which will be handy if they don’t manage to sign the original too…",
      "",
      "7) Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea)\nNow this one really does make sense for Newcastle. He’s likely to be pushed down the Chelsea pecking order by Joao Pedro and Liam Delap and Manchester United have been strongly linked. But Newcastle can offer a) Champions League football and b) a style that suits Jackson rather more than the Pep-ball Lite at Stamford Bridge. All Chelsea need to do is stop pretending he is worth £80m and double their money at around £65m instead.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Retegui (Al-Qadsiah)\nThe Italian striker has already taken the filthy lucre (over £50m over three years, according to reports) to leave Atalanta for Saudi Arabia, so it will be a hot year at least before he is looking for a transfer back to Europe.",
      "",
      "5) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nPoor Eintracht Frankfurt. They lost Marmoush to Man City in January after an excellent 15-goal half-season and then lost Ekitike to Liverpool in July after a 15-goal full season. We have a feeling that Marmoush may be brilliant for City in 25/26 after a full Pep pre-season.",
      "But it does mean that we only have Jackson as a viable alternative to Isak so far and things are not about to get any better…",
      "",
      "4) Jonathan Burkardt (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nThe 18-goal Mainz striker is the replacement for Ekitike (or is it Marmoush?) so he’s another Isak-like footballer who is not available to Newcastle United, Liverpool or Manchester United.",
      "",
      "3) Marcus Thuram (Inter Milan)\nNow this is genuinely interesting as the Frenchman was strongly linked with Newcastle United two years ago, while links with Manchester United have been persistent, and even Arsenal have had a sniff.",
      "He scored 14 Serie A goals last season and outscored his xG by 4.1, but the number that might put off potential suitors is his age: He will be 28 next month, making him over two years older than Isak.",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane (Bayern Munich)\nEx-Manchester United footballers will never tire of telling you Manchester United should sign Harry Kane. It ain’t going to happen yet, but we think he will be back.",
      "",
      "1) Georges Mikautadze (Lyon)\nWe predicted a Manchester United move in the wake of his brilliance at Euro 2024 and he has since been linked with the Reds, Tottenham, Nottingham Forest, Newcastle United and Sunderland. He would be the cheapest option on this list by some margin, with Lyon looking for around £25m for the Georgian striker who scored 11 Ligue Un goals last season despite starting just 13 games as he found Alexandre Lacazette a difficult man to shift."

The obvious candidate? Crystal Palace’s very own no. 10 Eberechi Eze. What a signing he could be.",

      "Everton: 3, 4, 8, 9 and 11\nEverton need numbers; they currently have 16 senior outfield players and that is decidedly not enough. We expect Thierno Barry to take the No. 9 but the many squad number gaps reflect the need for Everton to recruit across the board.",

      "Once a second offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons was rejected Ruben Amorim’s side had a choice to make: begrudgingly accept that various taxes from a Manchester United one to a general Premier League levy was going to be applied; or walk away from a deal for their priority target who they had already invested a large amount of the transfer window on pursuing.",
      "There was at one stage an insistence that Manchester United would not be held to ransom but they excel at few things more than baulking at a fee while paying it.",
      "This is their new transfer policy and it costs a pretty penny.",

      "Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle)",
      "Fee: £52m rising to £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £36.4m",
      "Is Anthony Elanga worth £55m? Perhaps only to Newcastle but when the Magpies have understandably identified him as an ideal fit in their counter-attacking system then it hardly matters.",
      "Newcastle had bids of £35m and £50m rejected for Elanga in summer 2024. After a season in which his six goals and 11 assists were crucial in helping secure European qualification for Nottingham Forest, a slight increase for their priority target was palatable.",
      "And if Eddie Howe succeeds in protecting Alexander Isak from the clutches of Liverpool, he has a pair of international teammates who have already established a connection he can coach and nurture.",
      "It is, for the first time since Sandro Tonali two years prior, a signing which represents an immediate first-team upgrade at St James’ Park.",
      "As the most recent scorer of a Champions League knockout stage goal for Manchester United, Elanga even brings a degree of experience to a stage Newcastle are still adjusting to.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Spurs)",
      "Fee: £55m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £39m",
      "There is always a quirk in the system and the idea Spurs overpaid for Kudus seems curious.",
      "The deal was struck for £30m less than his release clause with a bitter rival, who had three years left on the contract of arguably their most gifted player.",
      "But coming off the back of a season in which Kudus scored five goals, assisted three and suffered a stunning headloss against Spurs themselves resulting in a considerable ban, it could be argued that the Europa League winners paid a little over the odds.",
      "Thomas Frank pinpointed Kudus as his main transfer target because of the “unpredictability” the Ghanaian can provide in attack at “almost the perfect age to perform and hit the next level”.",
      "While moving a player with those characteristics across enemy lines was always going to require some intricate negotiations, Spurs pushed it through at a price both parties could sell as a win.",
      "",
      "Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal)",
      "Fee: £48.5m rising to £52m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £34.7m",
      "If you listen to Arsenal supporters, which is medically inadvisable at the best of times, the Madueke signing is not only an egregious use of club funds but an act so deeply objectionable as to prompt petitions, protests and defaced murals.",
      "That the line for those deeply ‘entitled’ fans is drawn at their favourite football club making what they deem to be an underwhelming signing, rather than the shameful handling of the Thomas Partey debacle, is a cripplingly damning indictment on the modern world.",
      "But there is a sense that better value than Madueke was out there if Arsenal dared to look beyond Stamford Bridge.",
      "The case for the defence would be that a 23-year-old England international already settled in London and familiar with the Premier League, who can play in and cover more than one position in a shallow attack, is worth stretching the budget for to mitigate any concerns over a player from a different country needing time to acclimatise.",
      "Madueke offering a different skillset to break down those low blocks could also be crucial for an Arsenal side which has proven decidedly one-dimensional and unimaginative at times in their last three years of sustained Premier League title challenges.",
      "The wider outlook would likely have been completely different had Madueke arrived after the long-awaited Proper Striker was captured but as long as a deal for Viktor Gyokeres is finally pushed over the line this summer and a Chelsea cast-off does not represent Arsenal’s biggest attacking addition, those fan frustrations should soon be drowned out.",

      "Fee: £62.5m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £52m",
      "The spotlight which comes with a move to Manchester United cannot have surprised Cunha but being scapegoated by Newcastle for their lack of signings and blamed by Sporting for their valuation of Viktor Gyokeres seemed curious.",
      "It is unknown precisely how far Manchester United would have gone in the bidding if Cunha wasn’t accompanied by a release clause which specified his price tag – or indeed if they would have targeted him at all without one.",
      "A multi-functional 26-year-old Brazilian international forward with 42 goal contributions in 82 Premier League appearances does, after all, come with a premium.",
      "And if all else fails, Manchester United will simply continue Cunha’s career trend of being sold for £18m profit every two years.",

      "Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea)",
      "Fee: £55m rising to £60m\nTransfermarkt valuation at the time: £43.3m",
      "From the competition Chelsea faced for Pedro to the remuneration Brighton were due for their work in developing a former club-record £30m signing, the Brazilian was always going to cost a pretty penny.",
      "Throw into the equation the fees Chelsea consistently pay for forwards in particular – and what is effectively the antithesis of a discount at their favourite shop as Brighton are still making them pay for the Moises Caicedo mess – and it could be suggested that the Blues paid over the odds.",
      "But rarely if ever before has a player paid back their fee so quickly and specifically as with Pedro, whose first three Chelsea goals helped win the Club World Cup and earn Enzo Maresca’s side an extra £30m or so.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he’s “ready to receive the players” that Manchester United are actively trying to offload – if they don’t secure moves this summer.",

      "Marc Cucurella has questioned the timing of Noni Madueke’s transfer to Arsenal, calling it ‘strange’ and a missed opportunity.",
      "This summer has confirmed the existence of the Premier League tax beyond all doubt, with one Arsenal transfer unsurprisingly taking the expensive biscuit.",
      "A former Arsenal player has backed Noni Madueke to become a starter, while criticising fan reaction and comparing him to Kai Havertz."

      "Marcus Rashford is said to be a “very lucky boy” to leave Manchester United for Barcelona as a move to the Championship club would be more “logical”.",
      "Rashford has fallen on his feet as he’s secured a move to La Liga champions Barcelona. He has joined the Spanish giants on loan with an option to buy for around £26m.",
      "The Man Utd outcast is fortunate to get this move as he has been heavily criticised for his poor form and attitude over the past couple of years.",
      "Ruben Amorim could not inspire the England international to return to form at Old Trafford as they butted heads before he joined Aston Villa on loan in January.",
      "Rashford boosted his reputation during his brief stint at Villa as he grabbed six goals and four assists in 17 appearances.",
      "READ: Manchester United make hilarious transfer ‘decision’ over Alexander Isak after ‘transfer request’",
      "His recent upturn sparked interest from elsewhere and Barcelona eventually decided to take a calculated punt on him after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",
      "Former Premier League forward Stan Collymore thinks Barcelona are “getting the best of the deal”, which is “poor” for Man Utd.",
      "“I think this Rashford deal is poor for Man United. For a player at the peak of his career that they’ve nurtured to possibly only get £25m for him if Barcelona buy him next summer, having paid an absolute arm and a leg in wages over the years, isn’t recompense at all,” Collymore told Caught Offside.",
      "“For the player, it’s quite unbelievable. He had a poor last season at Man United, goes to Aston Villa. Cameo appearances that were not particularly great, but by the way that Gary Lineker talks, you’d thought it was Lionel Messi playing for Villa last season.",
      "“For Barcelona, what do they get? They get a player on the cheap whose wages will be nowhere near the £300k mark if they were to buy him permanently next summer.",
      "“But they get the best of the deal, quite simply, because they’re going to get a player that’s motivated to play for them. All that was coming out through the season last season was, Marcus Rashford won’t sign for Aston Villa permanently because he’s waiting for Barcelona.”",
      "Collymore has also explained why a move to a Championship team would make more sense for Rashford at this stage.",
      "“I think the greatest story here is how players can effectively be so poor for a couple of seasons, basically, including the loan at Villa, and still dictate where they want to go to a club that’s playing in the Champions League and arguably among the four or five biggest clubs on the planet. And I find that remarkable,” Collymore continued.",
      "“I think that from a Barcelona perspective, it’s only because they’re still coming out of that negative financial situation that they were in, so that they were doing lots of wheeling and dealing in the last three or four years.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford, make no bones about it, he’s a very, very, very lucky boy, because if football had any logic, he would probably be getting a move to Blackburn, Norwich or another aspirational championship club – certainly not one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",
      "According to reports, three Barcelona stars are ‘genuinely upset’ at Marcus Rashford’s transfer as he is to ‘trigger’ three summer exits.",
      "Lamine Yamal reportedly feels he has been ‘deceived’ by Barcelona over the signing of Marcus Rashford, and is angry that he was not ‘involved’ in the transfer decision, like Lionel ...",
      "Marcus Rashford says he already “feels at home” in Barcelona after his loan switch was confirmed on Wednesday and also addressed ‘the situation’ at Man Utd.",
      "Two Barcelona stars have been ‘very cold’ towards Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford in a ‘bad start’ for the England international, according to reports.",

      "‘Meanwhile, Casadó continues to work with humility and ambition, aware that this may be the season that marks his definitive leap to the elite. In the club they see him as a natural relief for key positions in the midfield and a piece with a lot of future. United squeezes, but Barça and the player, for now, stand firm.’",

      "‘Should he decide to leave it is unlikely United would be difficult to deal with in terms of a fee considering all those injuries and his lack of appearances – only 27 in the last two campaigns.’",
      "The Sun also claim that the Red Devils have ‘ruled out breaking the bank’ to sign a new No.9 as ‘the club is not in a position to go large unless there are significant exits’.",
      "This is a factor in Hojlund’s favour as ‘the decision not to push the boat out opens the door’ for him ‘to stake his claim during the three-match Premier League Summer Series tournament against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton’.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s verdict on the striker is another reason behind United’s sale decision. The report adds:",
      "‘United chief Ruben Amorim, though, looks set to give the Dane, 22, a final chance to show he can be the Old Trafford spearhead.",
      "‘Amorim believes the arrivals of Cunha and Mbeumo will give United a new attacking dynamism, allowing Hojlund to flourish in front of goal.’",
      "Tottenham were slightly better than a terrible Man Utd to win an actual trophy, but they’ve got four players in this list of ten who should be axed this summer.",
      "Mohamed Salah makes a rare appearance in the Premier League Worst XI and he is joined by two Liverpool teammates after their 3-1 defeat at Chelsea.",
      "A new report claims Manchester United’s decision to reward Luke Shaw with a new contract ‘didn’t align with the data’ at the time."

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

Some players have to find a new place to have space in the team. Other players show they want a new challenge and a new team.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to think and decide. If they reach a point where they will have to join the team, they will join because they are our players.",

      "Marcus Rashford has completed his season-long loan move to Barcelona, which, SSN understands, includes an option to buy for £26m; Rashford fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim and spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa; now Spain switch presents a big opportunity",
      "Thursday 24 July 2025 11:34, UK",
      "Manchester United get a player with no future under Ruben Amorim off their books and free up considerable space on their wage bill. Barcelona acquire a potentially world-class forward without having to commit to signing him on a permanent deal.",
      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Courtesy of Man Utd",
      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."

      "Tuesday 22 July 2025 14:33, UK",
      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has moved to Manchester United in a deal worth up to £71m.",
      "After weeks of protracted talks and rejected bids, United and Brentford agreed a package last Friday that included a guaranteed £65m payment to be made in four instalments, as well as £6m in add-ons.",
      "Mbeumo, who has signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, has joined in time to be part of the United squad that flies to the United States on Tuesday for the club's pre-season tour.",
      "The forward said: \"As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams; the team whose shirt I wore growing up.",
      "\"My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "\"Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.\"",
      "United had been in talks with Brentford for over a month, making a previous offer of £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons over a fortnight ago, which was rejected.",
      "That was after Spurs had held talks with Brentford for the player, with Thomas Frank keen to bring him to north London.",
      "But Mbeumo, who had two years left on his Brentford contract, always preferred a move to Old Trafford.",
      "It is understood the add-ons for Mbeumo are very achievable, mostly based on appearances and goals in the Premier League, meaning it is likely Brentford get close to £70m for him.",
      "If United can resurrect their trophy-winning form under Ruben Amorim, then it is even more likely the fee reaches the full £71m.",
      "The likely extras mean Brentford stand to make more than £60m in profit on a player they signed for just £4m from Troyes in 2019, and who went on to score 70 goals, as well as making over 50 more for team-mates.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for a number of strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins, Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres, and Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "United have been tracking his development for a number of years, back to when he was playing for RB Salzburg, and while Arsenal held preliminary talks for Sesko, a deal never progressed and they are now close to signing Gyokeres.",
      "A heavy focus for Manchester United will also be on exits.",
      "Barcelona have agreed to sign Marcus Rashford on loan, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."
