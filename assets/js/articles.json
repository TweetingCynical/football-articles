      "Peter Schmeichel insists the job of a Manchester United goalkeeper is \"to save the team 10 points a season, not give them away\" as he issued his verdict on Senne Lammens debut at Old Trafford. The Belgian was bought into the club in the summer amid a goalkeeping reshuffle.",
      "Lammens was an unknown quantity and was signed whilst Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir were both at the club. In a surprising turn of events the Cameroonian, who had endured an error-strewn two years in Manchester, was allowed to leave on loan.",
      "That left Bayindir, who began the year as No 1, as the first choice under Ruben Amorim. He too has made notable mistakes with United struggling for results, eventually leading to a change against Sunderland.",
      "Lammens kept a clean sheet but Schmeichel insists too often in recent years United goalkeepers have given up points, when he was told their core remit was to ensure the team banked more points than they were perhaps entitled to, owing to their goalkeeper's performances.",
      "He told Monday Night Club: \"You think about the goalkeepers that we've had over these last couple of years and how many goals we've conceded from errors, nine errors already this season - it's too much.",
      "\"I go back to when I played, my instruction was and it was the same with Edwin [van der Sar] and David de Gea, we had to save the team 10 points a season, not give them away and that's what we've got used to in the last couple of years, goalkeepers giving goals away and therefore losing points. First of all, it's nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance.",
      "\"It's what you see, you see this young lad, he didn't really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "\"You'd expect that from any young goalkeeper these days - as that's how they're brought up - so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he's done that, he's a goalkeeper now, he's saving balls.\"",
      "De Gea, at his peak, was a hugely influential goalkeeper on the red side of Manchester. He picked up numerous individual accolades and was courted by the likes of Real Madrid. A number of the club's former players, Gary Neville among them, aired concerns over their lack of a quality goalkeeper before the season begun.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Paul Scholes has lifted the lid on how some of his former England teammates tried to use international duty as a stepping stone to secure a dream transfer to Manchester United. The Salford-born midfielder spent his entire professional career at Old Trafford, and he's widely regarded as one of the club's finest ever players.",
      "During Sir Alex Ferguson's tenure, Scholes won 11 Premier League titles, 10 domestic trophies, and two Champions League medals. He also earned 66 England caps as part of the so-called 'Golden Generation' alongside Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand.",
      "However, his close bond with Ferguson and his status at one of the world's biggest clubs came with an unexpected downside. Speaking on The Good, The Bad, and The Football podcast with Paddy McGuinness and Nicky Butt, Scholes said: \"Do you know what I found with England all the time?",
      "\"Someone always used to pull you to say, 'Tell your gaffer I want to come and sign for you.' 'F*** off. You're here to play for England.' You know what I mean?",
      "\"They were obsessed. I always found the lads who weren't at big clubs like Liverpool, Arsenal, United... I always felt they used England as a bit of a way to get a move to a big club.\"",
      "Scholes scored 155 goals and provided 82 assists in 716 appearances for United before hanging up his boots in May 2013. He saw his illustrious career at Old Trafford end around the same time as Ferguson's 27-year reign.",
      "It comes as the Premier League takes its second international break of the season, with a host of stars from clubs across Europe joining forces under Thomas Tuchel for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The Three Lions are gearing up to take on Wales in an international friendly at Wembley on Thursday, October 9. On the clash, Thomas Tuchel said: \"It is an Alzheimer’s Society international – it brings a very important topic into the spotlight.",
      "\"I can totally understand that people will maybe go and fall into the trap of going into the narrative that it’s only a friendly and then we are almost qualified and it’s an easy match in Latvia looking at the table, but it’s the opposite.",
      "\"We have to keep going. First of all, it’s Wales, so it’s a derby, it’s emotional and it’s a big crowd in Wembley. The competition is on to be in the squad first of all, to be selected; competition is on to be on the pitch and play.\"",
      "Then, England will jet off to Riga's Daugava Stadium to face Latvia in a bid to secure their spot at next year's World Cup. With only three matches remaining, England currently sits atop Group K, having secured five victories from five games, a comfortable seven points ahead of Albania in second place.",
      "Consequently, the Three Lions need just two more wins to officially book their ticket to the tournament. However, England could seal their qualification even earlier, depending on how Serbia, currently in third place, perform in their upcoming matches.",
      "The team has qualifiers against Albania and Andorra this month, and if they fail to win either match, England will be out of reach, and they will therefore not qualify.",
      "Serbia have two crucial qualifiers in October, against Albania and Andorra, and should they fail to secure maximum points in either of these fixtures, England's journey to next summer's tournament will be confirmed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The two-week international break has come at the perfect time for Liverpool, who are currently dealing with several injury concerns. The Reds have endured a torrid run of form, losing their previous three games against Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "Arne Slot will be eager to return to Premier League business and rectify his team's recent struggles as they seek to defend their top-flight crown. Equally, the international hiatus could prove hugely valuable given the club's lengthy injury list.",
      "With Liverpool's next fixture scheduled for Sunday, October 19, against rivals Manchester United, Slot will be praying he can field his strongest possible XI and that his international stars return unscathed from duty with their countries.",
      "Goalkeeper Alisson faces up to six weeks on the treatment table after picking up a hamstring problem during the Reds' defeat to Galatasaray in the Champions League last week. Speaking to reporters ahead of Liverpool's trip to Stamford Bridge, Slot said: \"Alisson is not a part of the squad tomorrow.",
      "\"And he's not going to travel to Brazil as well for the national team. So, he will be out for Saturday.",
      "\"How long he is out depends also on how fast a recovery goes. So, Saturday it's clear, he's not going to play for Brazil, and I would be surprised if he would be there in the first game after the international break.",
      "\"But from there on, sometimes things can go a bit faster or a bit slower. It's always difficult to say the amount of days and weeks, but for the upcoming games he will not be part of us or the Brazil team.\"",
      "Alisson wasn't named in Slot's matchday squad against the Club World Cup champions, with Giorgi Mamardashvili getting the nod between the sticks. The Georgian is expected to keep his place for the clash with United, with the Brazilian still on the sidelines.",
      "Expected return date: November.",
      "Slot has revealed that Konate was substituted during the second half of Liverpool's encounter with Chelsea due to injury. The defender was spotted with a slight limp.",
      "The Reds boss revealed in his post-match press conference: \"I don't know if it is a big injury, but what I do know is he limped a little bit and when I asked him, he said he felt his quad a little bit.",
      "\"Then, for me, all alarm bells go off because in another sprint you never know if that is going to go good. It was also already a substitution I had in mind, maybe for a few minutes or a little bit later, because the right centre-back had a lot of ball possession and we needed to create from that position.",
      "\"We all know Ryan [Gravenberch] is quite good in that. It might be OK that he went off early enough, but it was clear I had to take him off because he was limping.\"",
      "However, according to Le Parisien, as quoted by the Liverpool ECHO, Konate is expected to link up with the French national squad during the international break, which provides an encouraging sign regarding his fitness levels. The centre-back is also reportedly confident about taking part in training sessions with France later this week.",
      "Expected return date: October 19.",
      "Robertson was also seen limping at the final whistle during Saturday's encounter with Chelsea, having apparently sustained an issue in the closing moments of the match. No official statement has been released concerning the full-back condition, but pundit Jamie Redknapp expressed serious concerns about the situation.",
      "Expected return date: Unknown.",
      "It has been confirmed that Endo will miss Japan's fixtures against Paraguay and Brazil over the coming fortnight due to an undisclosed injury. It remains unclear whether the problem persisted during the closing stages of Liverpool's encounter with Chelsea, where he entered the action as an 86th-minute substitute for Alexis Mac Allister.",
      "A statement from the Japan national team read: \"Japan National Team will be without Wataru Endo (Liverpool FC) due to injury in the Kirin Challenge Cup 2025 (October 10th vs. Paraguay in Osaka, October 14th vs. Brazil in Tokyo).\"",
      "Expected return date: Unknown.",
      "Leoni suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury during his Liverpool debut against Southampton in the Carabao Cup last month and has since had surgery. The centre-half is expected to be sidelined until 2026.",
      "Expected return date: 2026.",

      "Manchester United flop Andre Onana looks set for a permanent move to Trabzonspor, with club chiefs already exploring a deal. The Cameroonian goalkeeper joined the Turkish side on a season-long loan late in the summer window.",
      "His move away from Old Trafford came after a rollercoaster two years at Old Trafford in which his performances had been blighted by high-profile errors. Onana has enjoyed a more positive start to life with his new club, having kept two clean sheets across his first four appearances.",
      "Trabonspor do not actually have an option to sign Onana permanently once his loan deal expires but it appears that they are keen to keep him around regardless. As per The Sun, club chiefs have already been in touch with the goalkeeper’s camp and expressed their desire to sign him permanently.",
      "It is suggested that head coach Fatih Tekke has been left impressed with Onana’s performances, while his leadership qualities have shone. Talks with United over a permanent deal are anticipated to take place come the end of the season.",
      "The Red Devils are yet to set a price for a permanent deal, having paid £47m to sign him originally from Inter Milan. Onana still has just under three years to run on his contract with United.",
      "Speaking about his start to life with his adopted employers, he said: \"I am very happy. I can say that I am very happy. I am starting a new project, a new adventure for me, I am very happy to be here. This is a feeling that makes me so happy.",
      "“I've never felt so much love from people around me. It's a wonderful feeling to be made to feel at home from the very first moment.”",
      "Trabzonspor president Ertugrul Dogan has already spoken out on a permanent move. He said: “Onana has just joined us, and we and the technical team are pleased.",
      "“He’s a player who cost his team €65 million, including bonuses. It’s impossible for Trabzonspor to make a transfer under those circumstances. If the technical staff is happy, we’ll see what we can do at the end of the year.”",
      "Onana, 29, made 102 appearances for United. But he fell out of favour under Ruben Amorim this season having been replaced by Altay Bayindir.",
      "His only appearance for the Red Devils this season came in a disastrous Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town. Summer signing Senne Lammens now looks set to be United’s number one for the foreseeable future.",

      "The gamble proved successful, as Lammens delivered a composed maiden outing in the famous red shirt. The Belgium international, who arrived from Royal Antwerp in an £18million summer switch, was only called upon to make three stops but looked authoritative throughout.",
      "He commanded his penalty area with confidence and appeared completely at ease between the posts. The Stretford End faithful even serenaded him with chants of \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" suggesting the supporters have warmed to Lammens remarkably quickly.",
      "With Bayindir recording the poorest save percentage of any Premier League goalkeeper this campaign, Lammens' introduction felt inevitable.",
      "Since his switch from Antwerp, United officials have been delighted with the shot-stopper and believe they made the right call in pursuing the promising talent rather than a more seasoned option such as Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez.",
      "According to the i paper, there's not a single negative comment about Lammens, with insiders revealing he's always the first to arrive and last to leave training. It's reported that Lammens is constantly putting in extra work, whether it's improving his distribution or other aspects of his game.",
      "Lammens' maturity is frequently mentioned, with the young player already having sorted out his own private accommodation and planning to stay at United for the foreseeable future.",
      "If he continues on this trajectory, he could leave as lasting an impression as David De Gea did during his 12-year tenure with the Reds.",
      "After Lammens helped United secure a 2-0 victory against Sunderland, head coach Amorim praised him post-match: \"Senne did a great job, gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this, clean sheet, is important for our team.\"",
      "Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko netted goals for the Reds, securing a much-needed win ahead of the international break. Amorim added: \"Yeah, and a clean sheet is really important.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will remain the club's boss for at least another few weeks after beating Sunderland. Tensions were eased at Old Trafford following a third straight home win, though it's been speculated the under-fire boss could still have been fired heading into the international break.",
      "Summer signing Benjamin Sesko scored one of United's two goals on Saturday and has been rightly praised by a certain club legend. Meanwhile, another United alumnus has raised alarm about the club's \"history disappearing\" after a tragic turn-out for the latest England squad.",
      "After a return of just two wins from his opening six Premier League games and a humiliating Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby, pressure has mounted on Amorim this season. But Saturday's triumph over Sunderland moved the club up to 10th in the table and alleviated some of that burden as club football breaks for the next fortnight.",
      "However, it appears Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are keeping a watchful eye over the managerial situation. That's after journalist Fabrizio Romano suggested defeat to a high-flying Sunderland side could have been enough to call an end to Amorim's tenure if the scoreline was bad enough.",
      "\"What is happening is also that Man United won the game against Sunderland and closed all the speculation, at least for the next few weeks, for Ruben Amorim,\" Romano said on his official YouTube channel. \"So they head into the international break way more relaxed.",
      "\"The new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, finally started and got a clean sheet – and so a very good start for Lammens and a very good result for Amorim. As I told you guys, Man United were not going to sack Amorim even if Man United were going to lose the game against Sunderland. Even in that case, he was not going to be fired.",
      "\"That was the plan of Man Utd unless completely crazy things happened, like losing, I don’t know, 3 or 4 or 5-0. But, for example, losing the game, I don’t know, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, something like that, Amorim was not going to be fired.\"",
      "In the latest episode of 'United players thriving away from Old Trafford', Rasmus Hojlund's rebirth has continued in fine fettle at Napoli. That's after the Dane delivered the decider in a 2-1 win over Genoa on Sunday, improving his record to four goals in six appearances since joining Antonio Conte's side on loan.",
      "Given United have already acquired a replacement in Sesko, it perhaps makes most sense to sell Hojlund next year if they can get the right price. And Napoli will have first dibs on his signature after agreeing a £38.2million purchase fee for next summer, having already forked out £5.2m for the season-long loan.",
      "Romano has speculated the former Atalanta's striker's fast start in Serie A this season is already convincing the figureheads in Naples. And unless they pull out of the obligated deal like Chelsea did in Jadon Sancho's case this past summer, it appears the £43.4m deal will indeed be done.",
      "Also speaking on his latest YouTube debrief, Romano said: \"Apart from the obligation they trigger or not, Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "\"Napoli see Hojlund as part of their long-term project, and so it’s a loan with a buy option that might become an obligation, but it’s seen by all parties involved in this deal as a future permanent transfer almost guaranteed.\"",
      "Save for the example of Marcus Rashford, there isn't a player currently on United's books called up to the latest England squad. And even then, Rashford isn't technically a United player given he's impressing on loan at Barcelona and looks unlikely to ever return.",
      "It was only last year United broke a 48-year streak when they failed to see a single player named in the October 2024 England squad. That pattern has persisted under Amorim, much to the chagrin of former United winger and six-cap England international Gordon Hill.",
      "In response to Thomas Tuchel's latest selection, he wrote on X: \"If what I was told is true, that there is not one Man Utd player in the England squad apart from Rashford who is not [at] Man Utd, it is absolutely disgraceful and tells me that my club's history is disappearing. I hope not.\"",
      "It takes talent to recognise talent, and among the litany of United's best forwards of all time, Wayne Rooney ranks near the very top. So it will have been a privilege for Sesko to hear United's all-time top scorer signing his praises this weekend.",
      "It was the Slovenian's quick-thinking in front of goal that put the Red Devils two up at home to Sunderland and sealed the three points. In response to Sesko's latest display, Rooney picked out three team-mates in particular who stand to benefit from his presence in attack.",
      "\"I think he’s a handful, and I think he uses his body well, he challenges for balls,\" he said on The Wayne Rooney Show. \"It makes it easier for [Bryan] Mbeumo, [Matheus] Cunha when he’s on, or Mount to make runs in behind him, so I think that’s clearly something they’ve worked on.",
      "\"Obviously getting another goal will help him so the win was massive for all the players and for the manager, and it was much-needed.\"",
      "After opening his Premier League account with a consolation in the recent defeat at Brentford, Sesko has now scored in back-to-back games. Fans will be hoping the international break does nothing to interrupt that momentum.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has hit back at Ruben Amorim by detailing three reasons behind his exit from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker moved to Napoli on a season-long loan deal during the summer transfer window.",
      "He had slipped down the pecking order at Old Trafford and was told he could leave by United head coach Ruben Amorim. Antonio Conte's side hold a £38million obligation to make the Denmark international's switch permanent next summer, meaning Hojlund may have already played his last game for United.",
      "Hojlund's choice to depart United this summer wasn't a simple one, however, as he had originally been resolute about remaining to battle for his position. Even when the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arrived, the frontman felt he could win back his place if given the opportunity.",
      "When he was in the USA for United's pre-season tour, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes.",
      "\"I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 [like Kevin De Bruyne]. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. I'm just focusing on continuing that. Competition is fine with me.",
      "\"It sharpens me, as I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Despite his initial position, Hojlund ultimately accepted a deadline day switch to Italian champions Napoli. So far this campaign, Hojlund has netted four times in six appearances in all competitions - matching his entire Premier League tally for United during the 2024/2025 season.",
      "Speaking about what finally swayed his decision and persuaded him to embrace the next phase of his career in Italy, Hojlund waxed lyrical about Conte while speaking to Radio Kiss. The ex-Atalanta player said: \"Conte is a top coach.",
      "\"I came here because I knew this was an important step for me. Napoli is a great club and a wonderful place to live. It's exactly what I need right now in my career.\"",
      "Following six matches, reigning champions Napoli currently lead the Serie A standings, and remain on course to retain the title they secured last season, boasting five victories and just one defeat from their campaign. Hojlund isn't the sole former Manchester-based star flourishing with the Italian outfit at present, either.",
      "Scott McTominay has enjoyed a brilliant spell with Napoli since completing his switch from United last summer, registering 12 goals and six assists in the league during the previous term. Meanwhile, Manchester City icon Kevin De Bruyne is also excelling, contributing with three goals and two assists from his eight appearances in Serie A and the Champions League so far.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United icon Wayne Rooney has urged the current squad to keep faith in Ruben Amorim's tactics, despite the head coach claiming that punditry comments are influencing his players. Rooney had previously criticised Amorim's approach before their win over Sunderland, suggesting he'd 'lost faith' in the Portuguese coach's system.",
      "The ex-England forward wasn't alone in his views, with fellow former players Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt also expressing similar sentiments. In his pre-match press conference on Friday, Amorim voiced his concerns that the club legends' comments were beginning to seep into his team.",
      "\"I understand when people think 'what would this team be like in a different system?'\" He stated. \"Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles, even if we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2. That is my point with the players.",
      "\"I don't want to change your mind, but my players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys [pundits and journalists] when you say the problem of our team is the system.\" After Saturday afternoon's 2-0 triumph, Rooney was quizzed about his reaction to Amorim's press conference remarks.",
      "\"I'm sure they are,\" the striker responded on The Wayne Rooney Show when asked whether the squad were aware of his comments regarding Amorim's tactics. \"I said when I made the comments, it's not something that I really wanted to do but I feel you have to tell the truth on it.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim himself has been critical about the players. It wasn't long ago he was telling us it was the worst Manchester United team in the history of the club.",
      "\"That's him being honest. If that's his thoughts, that's his thoughts.",
      "\"For the players, they have to keep focused on what they're doing. He's the manager, listen to what he's saying and tactically what he wants to try and win games.",
      "\"That's the only way it changes, unfortunately. I've been there as a player and been criticised as a player. You have to just try and focus on your job and win games. You're at Manchester United.",
      "\"It's still one of the biggest clubs in the world so you have to expect to be criticised when you don't win games or play well. On the flip side of that, the benefits of playing well and winning games are huge.\"",
      "United now enter the international break with numerous current squad members travelling across the globe to feature for their nations. Upon their return, United face a daunting trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool in one of the season's biggest clashes.",
      "Arne Slot's side are feeling the heat after suffering three consecutive defeats across all competitions prior to the international break.",

      "Manchester United were linked with a mega-money move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba in the summer - but the midfielder has endured a season to forget ever since being told he would remain at the Amex.",
      "It was well documented that the Red Devils wanted to bolster their midfield, but ultimately failed to land any new face in that area. It remains a problem position and the expectation was that they would return to see if they could lure Baleba away from the Seagulls next year.",
      "In light of his performances, though, a rethink could be on the cards at Old Trafford. After all, United have been stung numerous times in the transfer market, spending huge sums on players, only to see them underwhelm in a red shirt.",
      "Unfortunately for Baleba, his struggles continued at the weekend as he was hooked - for a third time - at the interval. The Cameroon star has started six of their seven Premier League matches, but Baleba is yet to complete a full 90 minutes, despite excelling in his debut season at the Amex. On Saturday, he was replaced by Georginio Rutter with Brighton trailing 1-0 at Wolves - but they did go on to score in the second half to grab a draw.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler previously replaced his midfielder at half-time in their loss to Everton in August as well as last month's home draw against Tottenham. On this occasion he was hauled off as a precaution with Baleba on a yellow card.",
      "The German said: “No, it was because of the yellow card. Therefore, that's what I mean, it impacts the whole match plan, it impacts everything. So that's why it's very frustrating if you get for the first foul, always a yellow card. In my opinion there were no yellow cards, and therefore I think the balance has to be better.”",
      "Hurzeler was honest about the impact United's interest had on Baleba during the transfer window. Brighton had previously seen midfielder excel under them, only to move on for huge profits. Moises Caicedo being the most high profile example.",
      "The Brighton boss conceded \"it's normal that there will be some waves in their development\" when addressing the dip in Baleba's form. He told talkSPORT: \"I'm confident that we will get the best out of him, I think he needs time, he's a young boy, his development in the last year was incredible.",
      "\"Maybe it went a little bit too fast, there was a lot of rumours about him, he played an incredible season, but I always try to be humble with the players.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's consistent brilliance in front of goal has propelled Napoli to the top of the Serie A table, following their 2-1 triumph over Genoa at the weekend. The Manchester United loanee netted in the 75th minute, restoring the Italian champions' lead and placing them marginally ahead of Roma due to their superior goal difference.",
      "This marked his third consecutive goal at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona and his fourth in six matches since his deadline-day transfer. With Romelu Lukaku sidelined due to a severe thigh injury, Hojlund has stepped up to spearhead the champions' attack, earning him widespread acclaim in the Italian press.",
      "Corriere della Sport's match report heaped praise on Hojlund's clinical finishing and his consistent ability to find the back of the net - a trait that was noticeably absent during his two-year stint in Manchester.",
      "Their report stated: \"Hojlund's finishing ability also made the difference, with three consecutive goals at the Maradona and already four in six games.\" Despite a challenging first half where Napoli \"failed to build an attacking play\", the report lauded Kevin De Bruyne's impact upon his introduction in the second half.",
      "The former Manchester City midfielder was praised for \"bringing order and quality, revitalising the team, and inspiring his teammates. With him, Napoli seemed like a different team, both in terms of conviction and awareness.\"",
      "The Italian publication's match report wasted no time in crowning the Dane as the Serie A champions' main attacking threat, declaring: \"Napoli has found its true centre-forward. And they're enjoying it.\"",
      "It represents quite the accolade considering Lukaku spearheaded their title triumph last season, bagging 14 goals in all competitions. Yet with the Belgian hitman unavailable, Hojlund has seized his opportunity to command the Italian giants' forward line and has undoubtedly hit the ground running in Naples.",
      "With the 22-year-old now away on international duty with Denmark, Conte will be desperate for his talisman to maintain his scoring streak ahead of their journey to Torino on October 18.",
      "Hojlund's impressive return to Serie A has restored the striker's standing following a difficult spell at Old Trafford. la Repubblica chose a headline that captured how rapidly he has become indispensable, stating \"Hojlund has already taken Napoli: his goals for the top spot in the standings.\"",
      "His goal secured a crucial win for his team, catapulting them past Roma to top the league table on goal difference. Since his 2022 transfer to Atalanta, Hojlund hasn't had the chance to compete for major titles, but he's adapted brilliantly to Napoli's pursuit of consecutive league championships for the first time in their near-century long history.",

      "Manchester United are planning to welcome Lisandro Martinez back from injury before the end of the calendar year. Martinez, 27, has been sidelined since February after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in a clash with Crystal Palace.",
      "The defender started taking part in outdoor training towards the end of United's pre-season tour in late July, having been added to the Red Devils' new six-man leadership group by boss Ruben Amorim. Although Martinez is still training individually as he continues his rehabilitation, United are hopeful that he could return following the November international break.",
      "The Sun report that medical staff are planning to ease Martinez back into Amorim's squad, having been in and around his team-mates at Carrington. Last month, the Argentine travelled to the Etihad Stadium to provide support as United faced Manchester City.",
      "In another show of his commitment to the Red Devils, Martinez has been staying behind to watch training sessions and attend team meetings. It's not the first time that the former Ajax star has been forced to watch from the sidelines since joining United in a deal worth up to £56.7million in 2022.",
      "Martinez fractured his metatarsal in April 2023, requiring corrective surgery five months later, ruling him out until January 2024. The Argentina international then missed 26 games with a separate foot issue during the 2023-24 season, and a further 10 shortly after due to a knee injury.",
      "A calf strain also saw him miss a chunk of the run-in that year before helping United win the FA Cup. Having had a clean bill of health last season, Martinez suffered his ACL injury during February's 2-0 loss at home to Palace and hasn't played for club or country since.",
      "Amorim has singled out the 27-year-old as one of the reasons for their struggles this season, saying: \"We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him.\"",
      "Luke Shaw has started all seven of United's Premier League matches in Martinez's role as the left centre-back. Amorim prefers a left-footer in the position and Shaw, despite being a full-back by trade, has got the nod over Ayden Heaven, who started August's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat away to Grimsby Town.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim could be set for a telling January transfer window should the Portuguese boss still be in charge at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have mustered just 10 points from their opening seven Premier League matches this season.",
      "Having already suffered three losses, not including a bitterly disappointing defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, Amorim is well and truly in the United hotseat. A 2-0 home win against Sunderland on Saturday eased these concerns but a daunting trip to Anfield is next and a bad result there could undo any positives.",
      "Should Amorim remain in charge until January then some personnel changes will inevitably have to be made. Bruno Fernandes continues to be linked with a move to Saudi Arabia and the new year could be an ideal time to sell up.",
      "The Red Devils have long been crying out for a consistent and confident pair of hands between the sticks. Andre Onana was a failed buy from Inter Milan and cost nearly £50million. Altay Bayindir has also failed to impress.",
      "After a string of critical errors from both of these shot-stoppers, the former having now been shipped off on loan to Trabzonspor, young Belgian ace Senne Lammens was signed on deadline day for an initial £18.2m. He had impressed in the Belgian Pro League, and fans were thankful to see him handed his debut against Sunderland.",
      "The bar was set so low that simple catches during this match were cheered. But Lammens was assured on his first start for the club, so much so that chants of \"Are you [Peter] Schmeichel in disguise?\" bellowed down.",
      "A stunning save just before half-time to deny Granti Xhaka compounded a calm 90 minutes on the ball. Perhaps most importantly, he seemed dominant when balls came into the box from crosses and corners.",
      "It is too early to tell whether Lammens will be the solution, but if in a few months' time it turns out he is not, then a hefty fee might have to be tabled for a well-thought-of goalkeeper. Porto's Diogo Costa has been Portugal's No. 1 for some time and is just 26 years of age.",
      "His contract expires in 2027, and he has yet to agree on a new one. This deal reportedly includes a release clause of £65,m and Sky Switzerland reported that Amorim's side had shown interest this summer before snapping up Lammens.",
      "And although Fernandes has been United's saviour on numerous occasions and is still debatably their best player, perhaps now isn't the worst time to cash in. Fernandes' contract expires in 2027, when he will be on the verge of turning 33.",
      "Primarily, though, it is Amorim's reluctance to alter his system that means Fernandes' leaving isn't so far-fetched. The Portuguese ace has been forced to play in a deeper midfield role as opposed to his ideal No. 10 and often looks out of depth defensively.",
      "Amorim has said not even the Pope will get him to change how he sets up, and so as long as the 40-year-old is in charge, Fernandes will be compromising. The Daily Mail even reports Fernandes is unhappy with where he is being played.",
      "A fee of £100m, if that is indeed how much a 31-year-old Fernandes may fetch, would go a long way to securing the club's midfield. Brighton's Carlos Baleba could be brought in as a holding option, with Bayern Munich's Aleksandar Pavlovic an alternative, according to German outlet BILD.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, who broke out as a technical box-to-box player alongside the more defensive Declan Rice for England at Euro 2024, could also be ushered back into first-team contention. Losing a player as impactful as Fernandes may seem ridiculous, but should that offer come it would be too hard to turn down.",
      "One thing that has become clear at United, with the new season underway, is that a left-sided centre-half is desperately needed. Luke Shaw simply isn't cutting it, and he was savaged by Roy Keane for his Manchester derby performance.",
      "It remains to be seen what funds are available to United in January but if the club want to back Amorim then an ideal signing would be Sporting CP's Goncalo Inacio. The 24-year-old won two league titles under Amorim, is suited to his system and would slot in perfectly to the left of Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "A Bola reported over the summer that both United and Liverpool were keen on Inacio and a £52m release clause is present in his current contract which expires in 2027. Inacio is a regular for his country and helped them to the UEFA Nations League this year.",
      "It seems written in the stars that Inacio touches down in Manchester to help shore up the club's backline and with his deal up so soon Amorim's former employers could have their arms twisted.",

      "Football loving writer who spends much of his life on motorways getting to games all over the country. Passionate about football, my job and the Mirror. The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "So, here’s a quiz question… which was the last team to win the Premier League title while in transition?",
      "It is probably up for debate but Manchester United in 1996 - you can’t win anything with kids - might be the only answer. After shipping out Andrei Kanchelskis, Paul Ince and Mark Hughes, they brought in academy graduates David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and the like to be first team regulars.",
      "It was one hell of a shift - and gamble - by Sir Alex Ferguson to go from older, experienced and proven players to, er, kids who then won and carried on winning.",
      "Liverpool are slightly different in that they are already champions - and they are trying to transition towards a new team while being at the top. However, it is still no less of a gamble on Arne Slot’s part to shift away from the team which won the title last season to a completely different look.",
      "Two new full backs, new forwards and even a new playmaker. They have also spent £400m in building that new team. Some was enforced because Luis Diaz wanted to leave and Trent Alexander-Arnold joined Real Madrid and, for all those that said Liverpool would cope without him, it is clear they are missing the England right back.",
      "Let’s be clear here… it was also a traumatic summer when players suffered a collective tragedy in losing Diogo Jota who was so loved by all. Any dressing room would feel that sort of blow. The club handled it as well as they possibly could but it was another challenge for Slot and the whole dressing room.",
      "What is remarkable is the way that Liverpool stormed into this season. Jeremie Frimpong came in, Milos Kerkez and Florian Wirtz all started the season. Hugo Ekitike was also new in attack while Alexander Isak joined later. That is one hell of a shift in dynamic and playing style.",
      "Suddenly, last season’s midfield of Ryan Gravenberch with Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai was ripped up to accommodate Wirtz who is a beautiful, creative and artistic player. But so very different to what had gone before and ideally Liverpool would have to set up differently to accommodate him as a No10.",
      "To start as well as they did - five straight wins in the Premier League and also a good win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League - is a tribute to Slot’s man-management and also their incredible team spirit which saw them snatch late goals.",
      "Now we are perhaps seeing a more realistic outlook. A team needs time to gel. They were my choice to be champions - and I still think they are favourites.",
      "But the way they lost at Crystal Palace and now Chelsea shows that the team needs work. It needs to gel. Ibrahima Konate is struggling. The right back slot looks an issue. Where does Wirtz play? Isak looks undercooked.",
      "The ideal for any team is to strengthen when you are on top. But Liverpool did not actually have that luxury. They had to buy two new full backs, midfield needed strengthening anyway and the forward line needed reinforcing. They had lost players. So, rather than trying to strengthen, Liverpool had to rebuild and that was a major gamble for Slot but one actually he did not really have a choice on.",
      "It was obvious that Jurgen Klopp’s old team needed major surgery. Slot put it off for a year - and is now having to do it. Only time will tell whether they can come through the ultimate test. Slot was incredible in his first year - but now is a much bigger test and will really show his calibre as a manager.",

      "Alexis Sanchez scored for Sevilla in their rout of Barcelona and, despite claiming he wouldn't celebrate against his former club, the Chilean admits that emotions can sometimes boil over as the Spanish champions were humbled.",
      "The Manchester United flop scored one of four goals as the Catalans were well beaten, losing for the first time as they relinquished top spot in La Liga. Red Devils loanee Marcus Rashford scored, but it was nothing more than a consolation.",
      "Sanchez has played for numerous teams since his departure from Manchester. He's now found himself in southern Spain and celebrated as he scored from the spot after 13 minutes. As a show of respect the 36-year-old didn't plan to celebrate, but u-turned in the moment.",
      "He said after the game: \"I had said I wouldn’t celebrate, but sometimes the excitement overcomes me, and the desire drives me to do so. In truth, I hold a great deal of love for Barcelona.\"",
      "Sevilla were leading 2-0 when Rashford pulled a goal back for Barcelona. The hosts then scored twice in stoppage time to add some serious gloss to the scoreline with Jose Angel Carmona and Akor Adams both getting in on the act.",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick said after the heavy defeat: “We have to accept this defeat and look at the positive side. In the first half we made a lot of mistakes, but in the second half we were able to react. The international break this October will do us good.",
      "Sanchez famously chose a move to Old Trafford, despite huge interest from Manchester City, when he decided to leave Arsenal in 2018. His move to the Red Devils made him the highest paid player in the Premier League but he rarely delivered on that huge investment. He spent only 18 months at the club before being allowed to leave.",
      "He's since struggled to find a home. He's had two spells in Italy with Inter Milan - sandwiched in between that was a season at Marseille. More recently he headed to Udinese, the club he made his name out before signing for Barcelona.",
      "In the summer he returned to Spain to join the Seville-based outfit and has helped them enjoy a promising start to the season. He's scored twice in his five games for the La Liga side.",

      "He has made his mark in Spain thus far, netting three goals and providing five assists across all competitions. Barcelona had maintained their unbeaten run in La Liga prior to Sunday's clash, but a thrashing at Sevilla's hands saw them surrender a two-point advantage to bitter rivals Real Madrid at the summit.",
      "Sevilla broke the deadlock through an Alexis Sanchez spot-kick after 13 minutes before doubling their cushion via Isaac Romero in the 37th minute.",
      "AS targeted Rashford, particularly his dreadful record at Sevilla's fortress, the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium. They highlighted that across the three matches he has played the club away from home, the England international has tasted defeat in every single one.",
      "Rashford's experiences were branded as \"truly disastrous\" and it was emphasised that Sevilla's ground and facing the club away has proved difficult despite him claiming Barcelona's lone goal in the 4-1 reverse. Rashford first set foot on the pitch in 2018, coming on as a substitute in a goalless draw.",
      "Just two years back, Rashford had a challenging visit to Spain when his team was knocked out of the Europa League following a 3-0 away loss, further tarnishing his record at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.",
      "The Spanish outlet lavished praise on Rashford and his contributions, hailing his goal as \"beautifully crafted\" and asserting that he remains \"one of the most incisive players in attack.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo also penned: \"Beyond the numbers, the Englishman is increasingly displaying confidence and commitment. His ability to adapt to Hansi Flick's system has been one of the most positive aspects of recent weeks.",
      "\"This is despite the fact that the team, which has suffered two consecutive defeats, is not in his favour. On an individual level, Rashford continues to rise.\"",
      "They adopted a more optimistic perspective on the defeat, which leaves Barcelona second in La Liga with 19 points, and also highlighted that this loss marks two consecutive defeats after their Champions League fall to PSG.",
      "El Des Marque were among those who saw the silver lining in Rashford's performance against Sevilla. They lauded his goal in the first-half stoppage time, describing it as \"brilliant.\"",
      "The outlet gave Rashford's performance a 5/10 rating and commented: \"A great signing for Barcelona. A differential player who never fails when he has the opportunity. He scored his team's goal and was one of the most incisive players in the match.\"",
      "But they weren't nearly as kind about Rashford's attacking partner, Robert Lewandowski, who fluffed his lines from the penalty spot in the defeat.",
      "They remarked: \"He started and had one of his worst matches. He even missed a penalty from the penalty spot, which went wide. A day to forget for the Pole.\"",

Following the match, De Gea took to Instagram to share a picture of the team huddle, accompanied by a heartfelt message to supporters.",

      "The Gunners secured a routine win on Saturday and will now go into the international break as the Premier League leaders. Liverpool boss Arne Slot is having to digest another poor showing with the millions he spent unable to take the Reds to the next level.",
      "They are struggling to find a winning formula and, as a result, criticism continues to come their way.",
      "Manchester United managed to find a much-needed win for Ruben Amorim and then 24 hours later neighbours Manchester City did what the Red Devils couldn't - win at Brentford. That kept them in touching distance of top spot with Erling Haaland again their match winner.",
      "We'll keep you across all the fallout from the weekend's matches.",
      "That's all for today, folks.",
      "But join us again tomorrow for all the latest news from the Premier League.",
      "It looks as if Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City will be the trio battling it out for the Premier League title.",
      "Currently Tottenham have enjoyed a fast start under Thomas Frank whilst Bournemouth continued to perform borderline miracles under Andoni Iraola.",
      "But who really has enjoyed the best of the opening seven games? We can't agree, but you can read the various cases here!",
      "So, here’s a quiz question… which was the last team to win the Premier League title while in transition?",
      "It is probably up for debate but Manchester United in 1996 - you can’t win anything with kids - might be the only answer. After shipping out Andrei Kanchelskis, Paul Ince and Mark Hughes, they brought in academy graduates David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and the like to be first team regulars.",
      "It was one hell of a shift - and gamble - by Sir Alex Ferguson to go from older, experienced and proven players to, er, kids who then won and carried on winning.",
      "Liverpool are slightly different in that they are already champions - and they are trying to transition towards a new team while being at the top. However, it is still no less of a gamble on Arne Slot’s part to shift away from the team which won the title last season to a completely different look.",
      "Read John Cross' full thoughts here..",
      "Continuing on the Mo Salah theme...",
      "Wayne Rooney has accused the Liverpool superstar of not working hard enough for his team - and he reckons Salah is letting his ego get in the way of helping Arne Slot's men get back to winning ways.",
      "Man United legend Rooney believes Salah has been found wanting, when his side need him the most. Speaking on 'The Wayne Rooney Show', he said: \"I think top players have a bit of an ego, and Mo Salah has been one of the best players in the league for a long time.",
      "\"I think the last week has shown something. When it's going well and you’re scoring goals and winning games, it's great and the team will put up with that.",
      "\"But over the last week, I would question his work ethic. We know he doesn’t always get back and defend as much, but in the Chelsea game his full-back was getting torn apart and he was watching.”",
      "\"He's not getting back and helping and players like (Virgil) Van Dijk, and the leaders in the dressing room should be telling him, 'you need to help out.' That was a worry - and I think he has looked a bit lost over the last week.\"",
      "He was electric last season, but Liverpool's Egyptian king is not firing on all cylinders so far.",
      "The Reds boss said: \"I think today he had many opportunities to do what he's done so often. But yeah, he's a human being.",
      "\"It's not like every chance he gets is always a goal. We feel sometimes it is because of what he has done last season and so many times.",
      "\"But, yeah, he can also have a game where he has so many, so many...where he has chances and a lot of times in promising positions, but doesn't have a goal or an assist.\"",
      "Arsenal have been given a 44.23% chance of winning the Premier League - ahead of Liverpool who have been given a 30.61% chance of defending their title.",
      "Man City currently sit in fifth but they are the only other side in double figures, with a 14.32% chance of winning another title under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Damningly, Man Utd have a 0.14% chance of landing the title, according to Opta.",
      "A tough start to Florian Wirtz's Anfield career has left Real Madrid on red alert, according to reports in Spain. Madrid boss Xabi Alonso was the German playmaker's manager at Bayer Leverkusen, and there has been talk of a reunion if Liverpool decide to cash in on their £116m man.",
      "There is no suggestion at this stage that Liverpool plan to give up on the German international. He was left out of the starting line-up for Saturday's defeat at Chelsea, but showed promising signs after replacing Conor Bradley at the start of the second half.",
      "These aren't the games which will decide whether West Ham stay up or go down, and they won't be the results on which Nuno's long-term future lives or dies after they were beaten at Arsenal.",
      "Even so, there were positives compared to Graham Potter and Julen Lopetegui - or, to put it more accurately, fewer negatives. Under the previous two managers, fans might have been braced for conceding one or two more after falling behind, but that porousness wasn't on display under Nuno, while there were even a couple of promising moments going forward, with Niclas Fullkrug and Callum Marshall finding space before squandering chances, and we can probably file this in the 'things to build on' pile.",
      "Reece James has dropped out of the England squad due to injury and been replaced by the uncapped Nico O'Reilly. The Chelsea captain suffered an injury during their 2-1 win against Liverpool on Saturday.",
      "James, 25, will now miss England's friendly against Wales at Wembley on Thursday before Thomas Tuchel's side face Latvia away from home in a World Cup qualifier next Tuesday. The fixtures could see 20-year-old O'Reilly make his senior England debut.",
      "The Manchester City starlet was initially named in the under-21 squad, having played for England at ever age group from under-15 level.",
      "Ange Postecoglou admits he expects to hold talks with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis about his seven-game winless start during the international break.",

      "Bukayo Saka claims he's \"hungry for more\" after reaching 100 Premier League goal involvements. The Arsenal winger, who netted a second-half penalty in the 2-0 win over West Ham, now has 55 goals and 45 assists to his name after also racking up his 200th top-flight appearance.",
      "However, Saka insists the best is yet to come, stating: \"It feels very good. But yes, knowing myself, I'm always hungry for more but in these moments, I need to not take it for granted especially after being out with a few injuries over the last few months.",
      "\"I don't take these things for granted anymore, so I'm really happy with that milestone and I want to push on for more.\"",
      "Oliver Glasner admits Crystal Palace's lack of a clinical edge looks to be the \"missing link\" that is preventing them from becoming a top team.",
      "Their 19-match unbeaten run was ended at Everton with the Eagles boss making his frustration clear.",
      "He said: “We’re massively disappointed, it hurts, I saw 60 or 70 minutes of fantastic performance, but we didn’t take our chances when we were on top. That’s happened a few times now, and we’re 12 games into the season with only one defeat, but I think that [not being clinical] is the missing link for us to be a top team in the Premier League.”",
      "Gary Neville has slammed Ruben Amorim for fostering an “excuse mentality” at Man United after the manager suggested negative comments from pundits was affecting his team.",
      "Amorim said his players were susceptible to taking media criticism to heart before the 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday. Neville and other high-profile ex-United players like Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes have been open in their concerns about Amorim’s lack of tactical flexibility.",
      "Neville has now responded to Amorim’s comments with a scathing rant about the culture at the club. “I’ve not got a lot of time for that. For a start, if pundits are getting in your head, you shouldn’t be playing for Manchester United. Simple as that,” he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "“Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us, saying we’d win nothing with kids? That was the greatest and most successful centre-back of all time at that moment. Do they not think we got criticised during our careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory. You’ve got to step up.\"",
      "Eddie Howe admits that the international break comes at a bad time for Newcastle United, but admitted some relief after seeing off Nottingham Forest on the back of a tough week.",
      "The 2-0 victory over the City Ground side heaped pressure on Ange Postecoglou. But for Howe, it was all about his team holding their nerve during a tense affair on Tyneside, with two goals in the final half hour earning only Newcastle's second win of the season.",
      "Howe said: \"The break has probably come at a bad time for us with the momentum. We will take it and dust the players down and regroup. We started the season really well defensively. We have been solid and resilient. A good mix for us because you are only a goal away from winning a game.\"",
      "Erling Haaland has been declared a the \"greatest goalscorer to ever play in English football\", by Jamie Carragher.",
      "The Man City star scored for a ninth game in a row as he helped his side to victory at Brentford on Sunday. It was his 18th goal of the season for club and country.",
      "In light of another match-winning contribution Carragher said: \"I think we're watching the greatest goalscorer to ever play in English football. I honestly can't remember Jimmy Greaves, Dixie Dean and all those players from years ago. But I think of Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Harry Kane and Ian Rush for my club Liverpool.",
      "\"There's a difference for me between a great centre-forward or striker and a goalscorer. I think what we're witnessing now is something we've never seen before in our game.\"",
      "Pep Guardiola wrote another piece of Premier League history on Sunday.",
      "The Man City boss reached 250 Premier League wins in 349 which is faster than any other manager as it took Arsene Wenger 423. Sir Alex Ferguson took 404 games before the Premier League era.",
      "It also pushed City up to fifth in the table and Guardiola suggested that they will be back among the title contenders again after finishing last season empty-handed.",
      "He said: “We won a lot! Otherwise you cannot take this accolade without winning a lot of games. It’s an honour for me to be alongside Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger so I will invite them to a good dinner.",
      "“Maybe not in Manchester, maybe somewhere with more sun. No, we’ll do it in Manchester. It’s an honour, a pleasure to be part of that in the Premier League history.",
      "“I want to say thank you to the club, the organisation, the players and the staff that I had because we did it quicker, faster, better and really, really pleased. Now, let’s go for 250 more.”",
      "Pep Guardiola hailed match-winner Erling Haaland as “the best” striker in the business and also believes his side will be serious contenders for the title again.",
      "\"It’s just seven games for the Premier League,” he said. “I would say three weeks ago Liverpool apparently won the Premier League and now they have not.",
      "“It’s important to see the team better and better. Liverpool is an incredible team, like Arsenakl, the question is to improve and improve, the way we play, the way we defend, will help us to be close to fight.",
      "“I’m really pleased for this month since the Man United game. We are there and I have the feeling we are getting better and better.”",
      "Jack Grealish was Everton's match winner on Sunday and the Toffees have made their feelings clear as their loanee continues to be overlooked by England.",
      "He has been hugely impressive since joining Everton for the year, but is not back in the international picture.",
      "Man City fans will have held their breath when they saw Rodri limp off on Sunday.",
      "He missed almost all of last season and that was a huge reasons for their drop off.",
      "Pep Guardiola expects Rodri - who was forced off with a hamstring injury - to be out for two to three weeks.",
      "Jamie Carragher has doubled down on his criticism of Arne Slot's Liverpool side - whom he likened to a basketball team' this season - following their third defeat in a week.",
      "The former Red raised the issue after the first game of the season and has continued to stick with that theme.",
      "He said on Super Sunday Extra Time: \"My criticism of Liverpool being almost like a basketball team, again it has come back to haunt them.",

      "The result lifted United into the top half of the table and to within six points of leaders Arsenal. Amorim can now look forward to being in charge when United return to league action at Liverpool on October 19.",
      "Here’s a round-up of United news heading into the international break…",
      "Amorim said he wanted actions rather than words after Mount’s pre-match show of support. The midfielder said the squad are “100 per cent behind the gaffer,” before the Sunderland game, with the performance suggesting that was more than lip service to an under-pressure manager.",
      "When the United boss was told about Mount’s comments, he said: “I saw [that] today and I know they want to do their best, and I know they don’t want to change the coach all the time.",
      "“But, like I said during this week, to be with the manager is, ‘I will kill myself to go in every transition’. We need to show with actions.",
      "“And sometimes, when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end, they know that sometimes we can do better. So, I feel that during the week but we need to show that on the pitch, not just at home but also away.”",
      "The win over Sunderland may have eased some pressure but Gary Neville insists Amorim is “not off the hook”. The former United defender said winning the odd game is nowhere near enough for Amorim, who is yet to secure back-to-back league wins after almost a year in charge.",
      "“Manchester United win the odd game but that’s nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.”",
      "Sesko channelled his inner Roy Keane as he basked in his first Old Trafford goal. After opening his account in the loss at Brentford, the Slovenian was elated to score in a winning effort against the Black Cats after Mount’s well-taken opener.",
      "With a line that will resonate with the straight-talking club legend, Sesko told MUTV: “It’s my job to try to score as many goals as possible, try to win the game, try to help the team in every single situation and hopefully I get more moments like this.”",
      "On his dream-come-true moment against Sunderland, Sesko said: “To play for a club like this, even train every day, is an obvious pleasure and I’m looking forward to being back [after the international break].",
      "“It feels amazing [to score]. It feels even better because I helped the team to win the game because in the end, it's important to win the match. I try to help the team as much as possible.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "\"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Senne Lammens against Sunderland.",
      "That chant alone is enough to tell you how Lammens performed on his Manchester United debut last weekend. He made a confident first appearance and kept a clean sheet in a comfortable 2-0 win.",
      "United fans celebrated the goalkeeper claiming a cross like they would react to a goal and he was congratulated by Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw immediately after full-time.",
      "Ruben Amorim said of the 23-year-old: \"I think he looks confident in the first game, but the important thing is that the teammates help Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes, against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Explaining why Lammens' debut was delayed, Amorim added: “When Senne arrived here, first of all, Altay was playing, and then he arrives, and you can feel it, that he needs to adapt.",
      "\"New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So, it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now, it's just one game, and he needs to work because he needs to be prepared that in our club, things are really hard. But he did well, and again, he was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Amorim said before the game that Lammens was starting due to rotation, but it would be a huge mistake to continue to rotate his goalkeepers after the Belgian's strong debut.",
      "Lammens provided calmness and leadership at the back, something Altay Bayindir has been unable to do, and removing him from the team would be a backward step.",
      "United signed Lammens for £182.million from Royal Antwerp on deadline day having considered Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez, but club chiefs were understood to be convinced that Lammens was the best choice.",
      "The biggest argument to sign Martinez over Lammens was that he wouldn't need time to adapt to the Premier League. The remaining arguments in favour of the Argentine were not as compelling.",
      "United scraped a win against Burnley on the eve of deadline day, and Amorim said: \"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment.\"",
      "However, Lammens made it look easy against Sunderland and will become cherished by supporters if he can reproduce that level of performance consistently in the coming weeks.",
      "Fans are desperate to watch a decent goalkeeper again. They wanted to believe that they were watching the second coming of Schmeichel against Sunderland last weekend.",
      "United have been represented by some world-class goalkeepers in history, but they have also made their fair share of bad goalkeeper signings. Onana, Massimo Taibi and Mark Bosnich are just some on that list.",
      "De Gea and Edwin van der Sar don't buy a drink when they return to Manchester and Lammens is hoping to have a similar impact after sparkling during his first appearance.",
      "Amorim has been patient with Lammens - resisting the urge to introduce him to prevent damage to his confidence - and it made sense to finally play him against Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "The fixture was a huge opportunity to keep a clean sheet. He obliged and is now primed to face a genuine test in Liverpool after the international break.",
      "“He’s been really good, looks really sharp – I’ve been really impressed with him and I’m really looking forward to playing with him,” said Luke Shaw about Lammens after his arrival.",
      "Tom Heaton said: “I didn’t know too much about him. It’s only been a few days’ training but he seems like a really good lad; calm but a strong personality. His goalkeeping fundamentals are very impressive.”",
      "Mason Mount was the latest dressing room member to praise Lammens when he spoke after Sunderland, saying: \"Senne coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben (Sesko) and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.\"",
      "You cannot blame United fans for getting carried away about Lammens' potential. And the £18.2m transfer fee could prove to be a bargain if he develops into the player United scouts believe he can become.",

      "Ruben Amorim has said not even the Pope could make him change his Manchester United formation.",
      "Many argued Amorim's stubbornness would cost him his job following defeat to Brentford, but he made a significant change to secure a much-needed win against Sunderland.",
      "Senne Lammens punted the ball from almost every goal-kick. Diogo Dalot launched long throw-ins into the penalty area. There was a simplicity to United's approach that was reminiscent of a bygone era.",
      "United were direct and reverted to basics. It was a greatly effective change from Amorim, who secured a comfortable 2-0 victory to survive during the October international break.",
      "Amorim even ditched the beige chinos in favour of wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline, which felt appropriate given United played like a Stoke City team put together by Tony Pulis.",
      "There is no doubting that Amorim is a stubborn manager, but a leopard can change its spots.",
      "The 40-year-old did what was necessary against Sunderland - he tweaked to secure a victory. And it would be unfair to suggest United only secured the win due to their newfound directness, as every player delivered strong performances and there were some quality individual contributions on the ball.",
      "Amorim was asked if he was frustrated at the timing of the international break, given the team could build momentum, and responded: “There is no momentum with our team.",
      "\"So with a break, without a break… we know what happened when we win one game. And then for me, the frustration is not to see the same team at home and away.",
      "\"And you saw today, we didn't play well in the second half, but we were focused. We fight second balls. Ben [Sesko] was there to touch the ball all the time. So, these small things are going to help us win games. And sometimes you have your moments. First half, we had a lot of moments.",
      "\"But then in the second half, if we cannot play well, they will not play well, and that is the way a big team play during the season. So, that is the big frustration.”",
      "United sources were forced to clarify that Amorim retained the backing of the board after the Brentford defeat, communicating for the second time this season that he was safe.",
      "However, it's rare for a manager to recover once those enquiries begin and a win against newly promoted opposition at Old Trafford won't save Amorim if the situation sours when domestic football resumes.",
      "He was right to bemoan the team's lack of consistency when he spoke during his post-Sunderland press conference, because that is the problem undermining any progress.",
      "The failure to win back-to-back Premier League games is not good enough, although the events of the last week have made the upcoming Liverpool fixture an entirely different proposition.",
      "United will take on Liverpool at Anfield after the October international break. That game looked ominous for Amorim in the fixture list, but Liverpool are suddenly in crisis after losing against Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "There was a sense that Liverpool had been fortunate in securing late wins against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Burnley. They hadn't performed well and were bailed out by a few late goals.",
      "Liverpool will lick their wounds and the bookmakers will make them heavy favourites to beat United at Anfield, but the door is clearly ajar for Amorim to secure a tenure-making result.",
      "Slot has form for complaining when Liverpool's opponents don't play into their hands. He dislikes when a team plays direct, like United did against Sunderland - but there is no right way to play football.",
      "\"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match. It was set-piece after set-piece, long throws,\" said Slot after facing Newcastle. The Liverpool manager admitted he doesn't like being dragged into a battle.",
      "United have not won away at Anfield since January 2016 when Wayne Rooney scored a late goal to settle a scrappy encounter, and Amorim would snap your hand off for a similarly dogged win in Merseyside.",
      "The Sunderland performance provided a blueprint to beat the Premier League champions.",

      "Iconic ex-Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has aimed a dig at Andre Onana, and Altay Bayindir, as he offered up his verdict on Senne Lammens' debut. Following the positive outing, the iconic shot-stopper moved to temper expectations around Lammens after his first start.",
      "The summer signing made his United bow on Saturday afternoon as he kept a clean sheet during the 2-0 win over newly-promoted AFC Sunderland. Ruben Amorim made the bold move to drop Bayindir to his bench and hand the Belgian, Lammens, an opportunity to make his first appearance on the eve of the international break.",
      "His arrival comes during a turgid period for United goalkeepers with both Bayindir and Onana making several high-profile mistakes. Onana completed a temporary move to Trabzonspor of the Turkish Super Lig, allowing the 23-year-old to move up the ranks at Old Trafford and compete with the Turkey goalkeeper for a place in the first-team.",
      "Schmeichel couldn't help but highlight the previous misdemeanours from shot-stoppers that have come back to haunt United.",
      "And, although the early signs are positive for Lammens, the multiple-time Premier League-winning goalkeeper stressed that he didn't want to put too much pressure on his shoulders - outlining the real quality will be shown responding to mistakes further down the line.",
      "\"You think about the goalkeepers that we've had over these last couple of years and how many goals we've conceded from errors, nine errors already this season - it's too much,\" he told Monday Night Club.",
      "\"I go back to when I played, my instruction was and it was the same with Edwin [van der Sar] and David de Gea, we had to save the team 10 points a season, not give them away and that's what we've got used to in the last couple of years, goalkeepers giving goals away and therefore losing points. First of all, it's nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance.",
      "\"It's what you see, you see this young lad, he didn't really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "\"You'd expect that from any young goalkeeper these days - as that's how they're brought up - so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he's done that, he's a goalkeeper now, he's saving balls.",
      "\"From that, I think his confidence grew, you could see from the first cross, Matthijs de Ligt's reaction was fantastic, defenders want that when they're under the cosh to take some of that pressure off.\"",
      "He went on: \"It's not happened at Man Utd for a bit and of course, the defenders were happy about it. It's far too early to talk about it, how good this guy is, he's only young, he's hardly played any competitive football, he's most certainly not at Man Utd.",
      "\"Unfortunately we've seen over the years, great players come into Man Utd and the pressure is relentless - then they can't deal with that. It would be silly for someone like me to put more pressure on him.",
      "\"He did well, he's got an international break now then the next game he's got to do the same.",
      "\"Then we see how he develops, all goalkeepers make mistakes, that's when we find out how good people are, in how do they react to those mistakes? It was nice, clean and positive, things that we haven't been used to.\"",

The atmosphere afterwards [his goal] was unbelievable. It's something I've been dreaming about - jumping high in the stadium like that. My dream came true."

      "His only appearance for United this season came in the shock Carabao Cup loss to League Two side Grimsby Town. After a catalogue of errors and the signing of Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, Onana was allowed to leave.",
      "So far, the 29-year-old has played four games and kept two clean sheets. Now, the Turkish side is planning to negotiate a permanent transfer with United after being impressed with the Cameroon international.",

      "Under Erik ten Hag, the Reds paid £47million to sign Onana from Inter Milan, and it's expected that they will try to recoup as close to that figure when they sell the goalkeeper. However, Trabzonspor's record transfer sits at the £5.9m they paid Spartak Moscow from Majeed Waris in 2014/15.",

      "The 27-year-old joined the Catalan giants on a season-long loan in the summer after returning from his short spell at Aston Villa. Since moving to Spain, Rashford has scored three goals and assisted five across all competitions.",
      "It's understood that Barcelona have an option to make his move to the Nou Camp permanent for £26.2million. Recently, sporting director Deco clarified that they have the option to sign the England international permanently, rather than an obligation.",

Bayindir's confidence is clearly shot and so announcing to the world that he had been dropped would have been a foolish move.",

      "It took just eight minutes for Mount to vindicate his selection and the standing ovation for the midfielder when he was substituted spoke volumes. It was probably his best performance for United.",
      "\"It was obviously a big moment for us today,\" said Mount. \"I mean every game [is big], but today was a lot of pressure on the performance, on the win.",
      "\"Being at home, coming off obviously a difficult result, I think it was so important for us to start sharp. That was something that we obviously spoke about in the dressing room.",
      "\"Bruno spoke about before the game, before kick-off in the huddle. So I felt that, I felt the energy at the beginning of the game and obviously to get the goal, I think really settled us.",
      "\"And then to go on and get another goal, going into half-time 2-0 up, you're in a good place. I don't think we stepped off at all in the second half, it was kept a bit cagey, but it was massive to get a clean sheet as well. So yeah, a very important win for us.\"",
      "Mount continued: \"I think it was massive to really start sharp today. Big character to step up after a difficult game and we did that. Now we've got to push on, we obviously have a bit of a break now before the next game, but we need to take positives from this game and take them into the next one.\"",

      "There were green shoots after United's setback against Brentford last weekend. Amorim spoke about negative press potentially affecting the dressing room before Sunderland, but Mount insisted the players are focused on delivering what the manager wants to see on the pitch.",
      "When asked if external noise permeates the dressing room, Mount said: \"No. For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Mount praised the contributions of Senne Lammens and Benjamin Sesko, while reiterating that the squad is fighting together and behind the manager to 'continue moving forward'.",
      "He said: \"The defenders were amazing. So that was really important for everyone. I mean, for Ben [Sesko], scoring his goal was so important. I'm absolutely over the moon for him.",
      "\"And obviously, Senne [Lammens] coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.",
      "\"And everyone was around him. Altay [Bayindir] was around him. Tom [Heaton] was around him before the game. And that shows the togetherness we have.",
      "\"Obviously, even in this season, we've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking about his relationship with Amorim, Mount added: \"I have a good relationship with the manager. I don't think it's any better than all the other lads. I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he likes. As I have played it before in the past.",
      "\"So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I've done it before. So, I think that's something that I obviously understand.",
      "\"I think all the players understand it now. But I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe he could lean on me because I know the positions.\"",
      "Mount admitted United's players were hurt after losing against Brentford. \"It's difficult sometimes when you only have one game a week because there's a lot of time to think,\" he said.",

Under the stewardship of Sir Alex Ferguson, Scholes managed to clinch 11 Premier League titles, 10 domestic cups and a pair of Champions League trophies.",

However, holding such a revered relationship with Ferguson, and being a part of the biggest and most successful club in the world at the time came at a cost.",

      "England are set to face Wales in an international friendly at Wembley on Thursday, October 9, before heading to Riga's Daugava Stadium to face Latvia to cement their place at next year's World Cup.",
      "With just three games left to play, the Three Lions are currently at the top of Group K after five wins from as many outings, seven points clear of second-place Albania. As a result, England need just two more wins to officially make the cut for the tournament.",
      "However, qualification could come even sooner, depending on how third-place Serbia fare in their next two games. The nation face qualifiers against Albania and Andorra this month, and should they drop points in either match, England will be uncatchable and therefore qualify.",
      "Serbia face two qualifiers in October, against Albania and Andorra, and should they drop points in either of those two games, England’s passage to next summer’s tournament will be sealed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United made the perfect start to the game when taking an early lead through Mason Mount, and Benjamin Sesko extended the advantage as United led by two heading into the interval.",
      "Ruben Amorim needed a positive result after losing against Brentford last weekend, and there were huge cheers at the final whistle as United moved into the top half of the Premier League.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed at Old Trafford:",
      "Lammens sparkles on his debut",
      "Lammens finally made his debut after his deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp. Fans had wondered when Lammens would be given his first start, and it felt sensible to play him against Sunderland.",
      "The bar is low for Lammens to impress at United, given that supporters have watched error-prone goalkeepers Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir underperform over the last few seasons.",
      "That was highlighted when Lammens made a good save to deny a powerful shot from Granit Xhaka near the end of the first half. It was a decent save from Lammens - but a stop any goalkeeper worth their salt should make - and it was met by huge applause from each corner of the ground.",
      "Then Lammens came to claim a cross into the box with authority just minutes later - and the reaction from the crowd was so loud you would have thought they were celebrating a goal.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt sprinted to Lammens to congratulate him after the final whistle. Lammens also received a hug from Harry Maguire and a high five from Luke Shaw.",
      "Mount's first pump to the crowd",
      "Amorim made five changes to his starting XI to face Sunderland and Mount was selected to start over Matheus Cunha, a decision which was vindicated just eight minutes into the contest.",
      "Mbeumo picked out Mount in the box, but he still had plenty to do. Mount brought the ball down with his left foot and the touch was slightly heavy, although that didn't stop him from finishing intelligently.",
      "Amorim reacted on the touchline by calmly giving a simple thumbs up to his coaching staff, however, Mount's celebration in front of the Stretford End was a tad more enthusiastic.",
      "Mount roared to the terraces and passionately fist-pumped as his teammates prepared for the restart. You can tell the 26-year-old genuinely cares when he plays, and that goes a long way in the modern game.",
      "The towel worked a treat",
      "Amorim wore a full tracksuit against Sunderland and United scored a goal that Tony Pulis, who famously wore a full tracksuit during his managerial days in the Premier League, would have been proud of.",
      "Dalot launched a long throw into the box for Sesko's goal to make it 2-0. The Slovenia international reacted well to the flick-on to score his second goal for United in a week.",
      "Before taking the throw-in, Dalot dried the ball with a towel to improve his grip, which worked a treat. Arsenal have enjoyed success with Mikel Arteta in charge by making the most of the 'dark arts' and the introduction of towels around the side of the pitch was a no-brainer for United.",
      "Following Sesko's goal, Dalot created another opportunity with a long throw-in and he benefited from the towel again. United must do everything they can to give themselves the best chance of winning.",
      "Amorim learned from Chelsea",
      "It was disappointing to see Casemiro receive a second yellow card against Chelsea, as United were cruising into half-time before he foolishly made a cynical foul, which meant both sides had 10 men for the second half.",
      "However, Amorim learned from that episode by substituting Casemiro off against Sunderland just minutes after he had received a yellow card for bringing Brian Brobbey to the ground.",
      "Amorim could not take any risks with five minutes remaining and introduced Manuel Ugarte.",
      "No banner, no problem",
      "Amorim emerged from the tunnel for kick-off shortly after his players had walked out from the dressing room. And there wasn't much applause for Amorim from the Stretford End.",
      "It was also interesting that \"the good days are coming\" banner could not be spotted among the banners and flags that were unfurled. That banner was seen in the Stretford End before the Burnley game last month, but it appeared to be left at home after a bad result against Brentford last weekend.",
      "Amorim did receive some applause from fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, though.",
      "Matchgoing fans have continued to back Amorim, despite him failing to give them a reason to, but the muted reception for his emergence from the tunnel suggested a few have started to change their minds.",
      "Amorim desperately needed a win and will be relieved to have secured three points. His name was chanted loudly in the final seconds of the game - Amorim just needs to continue to win games.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "Manchester United secured a huge win over Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday to ease the pressure on struggling boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were enough to earn United three points that move them up six places to eighth in the Premier League going into the international break.",
      "Here is how United's players rated this afternoon:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "An assured United debut from the deadline day signing. Confident coming for the ball and made a fine save from Granit Xhaka and one near the end. Will be hard to dislodge him. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Disciplined in his defending and deserving of his recall to the starting line-up after being benched for the previous two games . Brings better balance to United's back three. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Another ebullient performance from the United skipper, who was seemingly everywhere, covering so much ground. Had an exquisite chip tipped onto the bar by Robin Roefs. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Kept his place following the Brentford debacle and it was from his long throw-in that Sesko was able to plunder United's second goal. Impressive energy levels. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Provided the assist for Mount's opener and never gave the Sunderland defence any peace with his runs in behind and ability to pick up dangerous positions. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scored for the second game running with a classic poacher's goal from close-range in the first-half. United exploited his aerial threat throughout to win second balls. 7",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Restored to the starting line-up and justified his selection by setting United on their way to victory with a superbly-taken goal. Standing ovation when taken off. 8",
      "Subs:",
      "Dorgu (Dalot, 64)",
      "Solid at left wing-back. 6",
      "Cunha (Mount, 64)",
      "Lively attacking threat. 6",
      "Mainoo (Mbeumo, 76)",
      "Not enough time to impact the game. 6",
      "Ugarte (Casemiro, 85)",
      "A late arrival. N/A",

    "body": [
      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "Goalkeeper Senne Lammens began his Manchester United career with a win and a clean sheet, and the Belgian international received plenty of credit from his home country's media. Lammens joined United from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day but has needed to wait patiently for his debut while Ruben Amorim continued to keep faith with Altay Bayindir.",
      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Manchester United secured their third Premier League win of the season on Saturday as they beat Sunderland 2-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "The visitors started strongly but United soon took control of the game and Mason Mount produced an excellent finish to put Ruben Amorim’s side ahead.",
      "Benjamin Sesko made it 2-0 shortly after the half hour mark as he grabbed his second goal in a week.",
      "Sunderland were awarded a penalty before the half-time break but the decision was overturned by referee Stuart Attwell after he’d been advised by VAR to head over to the pitchside monitor.",
      "United held strong in the second half to see out the win.",
      "Here’s all the reaction from today’s game:",
      "Ruben Amorim's Manchester United players delivered for their boss to spare him another uneasy inquest and potentially the sack.",
      "Amorim admitted ahead of the game that it would be impossible for him to carry on if results did not improve – with this game billed as make-or-break for the embattled United boss.",
      "Amorim will hope he can now head into the international break without worrying about getting a call from chief executive Omar Berrada thanking him for his time in charge.",
      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",
      "United remain a work in progress and have yet to win back-to-back league games under Amorim, but this win – albeit against a meek Sunderland side – has brought the head coach more time.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Alert to danger throughout and never caught out of position defending his goal. Played a key role in United's second goal, challenging for the flick-on that ultimately led to it. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Kept his place on the left side of United's back three, but moved inside to a more central position at times after the break, giving United greater control on the ball. 7",
      "Amad",
      "A constant threat down the right side. Tormented Sunderland's defence and unlucky not to score in the first-half when he cut inside and saw a goal-bound effort saved. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Back in the starting line-up following his one-match ban, he was disciplined in midfield, although he picked up an obligatory booking late on for a poor challenge. 7",
      "Read the full ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "Hugely important win before the October international break.",
      "Ugarte and Maguire ON.",
      "Casemiro and Shaw OFF.",
      "Mainoo has replaced Mbeumo for the final 15 minutes of the game.",
      "Casemiro fires well over the bar from the edge of the box after good work from Amad.",
      "Dorgu and Cunha ON.",
      "Dalot and Mount OFF.",
      "Amorim looks stressed on the touchline, despite his side having a two-goal advantage.",
      "Lammens looked to catch Traore as he went down in the box, but the Sunderland player is booked for diving.",
      "\"Stand up if you hate Glazers,\" is the chant currently echoing around Old Trafford.",
      "We're back under way for the seocnd half at Old Trafford.",
      "And here are your half-time ratings...",

      "Sesko",
      "Deadly. 7",
      "Mount",
      "Clinical. 8",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Mount and Sesko on the scoresheet for United.",
      "Common sense prevails and no penalty is given.",
      "VAR is checking for a Sunderland penalty.",
      "Lammens hasn't had much to do this afternoon, but he just made a good save to deny a powerful shot from Xhaka.",
      "All the talk was about Amorim's future after Brentford and this has been a great response.",
      "Amorim is wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline today and Dalot's long throw-in created the chance for Sesko to score. Tony Pulis would be proud of this proper Barclays football.",
      "Sesko makes it 2-0, reacting quickest to the loose ball following a throw-in from Dalot, which was flicked on by Sunderland’s Nordi Mukiele. Sekso showed quick reactions to turn the ball in from close range.",
      "Sesko with a second goal in the space of a week - and it's a good finish.",
      "He celebrated with a huge leap in front of the Stretford End.",
      "United have turned on the style in the first half an hour of this make or break game for Amorim and would be three or four up were it not for the brilliance of Sunderland keeper Robin Roefs in denying Mbeumo, Amad and Fernandes.",
      "But United need to turn their dominance into the hard currency of a second goal to give themselves some breathing space in terms of the scoreline.",
      "Amorim cannot believe United haven't extended their advantage. Roefs did brilliantly to deny Fernandes' effort and Amad headed the follow up wide of the post.",
      "United were 2-0 down within 20 minutes last weekend and this has already been much better.",
      "\"We heard you singing when Sergio scored,\" sing the Sunderland fans at Old Trafford.",
      "Think they probably need a new chant after all these years...",
      "Superb finish from Mount to give United the lead. Mount took down Mbeumo’s ball with a fine first touch with his left foot and then produced a clinical finish with his right to put the home side ahead. There was no emotion fron Amorim on the touchline, just a thumbs up to his coaching staff.",
      "What a brilliant goal from Mount, who finds the bottom right with an excellent finish.",
      "Mbeumo found Mount in the box but he still had plenty to do to score.",
      "Sunderland should have the ball in the net - but the move was eventually flagged offside.",
      "This is a huge chance for Sunderland to claim a win at Old Trafford, something they last did in May 2014 when Giggs was the interim manager. Sunderland's fans are in fine voice and are clearly well up for this.",
      "We're under way at Old Trafford, so follow the blog for live match updates.",
      "A minute’s silence is held at Old Trafford to pay tribute to the victims of the synagogue attack.",

      "How often have we seen striker's come to Manchester United with plenty of fanfare and then fail to live up to the hype?",
      "If you are asking in recent times, too often to count. Each new addition has been brought in with the promise of being able to change United's fortunes around.",
      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",
      "\"There is loads [still] to come, definitely. I’m still getting used to it more and more, to read the players, to connect with them even more.",
      "\"I believe I can be even better and I will try to show it.\" This admission should excite fans as few can argue that Sesko, when given the opportunity, hasn't looked like an improvement on last season's options at centre-forward.",
      "If there is more to come from Sesko, United fans have every right to feel optimistic. A more consistent goal threat will be just the tonic for Ruben Amorim as he looks to change the Reds' fortunes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Despite their win over Sunderland, many fans and pundits are expecting them to lose their first match back from the international break, when they will face defending champions Liverpool at Anfield.",

      "O’Riley said it was a chat with former Seagulls boss Roberto De Zerbi which persuaded him to make the switch to Marseille and it’s paid off so far, with the 24-year-old grabbing a goal and an assist in the most recent of four victories in the four games he’s played so far.",

      "If you wanted to learn how best to speedrun the all-too frequent flopping of young Manchester United footballers in the stress cauldron that that football club has become, Peter Schmeichel is putting on a clinic.",
      "A search for reasons as to why talented footballers arrive at the club and often briefly show promise before crumbling under the pressure should provide cause for introspection for the members of the Manchester United punditry caucus, who are absolutely just doing their jobs, but could also do with avoiding being so entirely hot and then cold, or vice versa, in their assessments of these players.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez,” Peter Schmeichel said just over two weeks ago. “In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.",
      "“Lammens could turn out to be the best signing ever – but right now, it feels like a hopeful one, and that’s not what United need at this moment in time.”",
      "Lammens could be the kind of guy to use that as motivation, but may also have found it hard to ignore a legendary Manchester United goalkeeper a) admitting he doesn’t know who the f*** he is, b) insisting United should have signed someone else and c) ramping up the pressure by questioning his ability to cope with it.",
      "And yet, after one (one!?) appearance for Manchester United, in which the fans serenaded the 22-year-old with chants of “are you Schmeichel in disguise”, one would hope with their tongues at least somewhere near their cheeks given he didn’t do an awful lot, Schmeichel claimed there was “some semblance to Edwin [van der Sar]”.",
      "“First of all, it’s nice to see a clean sheet, then a really good and solid goalkeeping performance,” Schmeichel said.",
      "“It’s what you see, you see this young lad, he didn’t really have much to do for a long, long time, he literally only had the ball at his feet and he did quite well.",
      "“You’d expect that from any young goalkeeper these days – as that’s how they’re brought up – so there was some resemblance to Edwin, a couple of long balls, he had that first save down to his left, which you expect him to save, but once he’s done that, he’s a goalkeeper now, he’s saving balls.”",
      "Schmeichel did caveat his praise for Lammens by insisting “it’s far too early to talk about if this guy is good or not”, but you can’t help but laugh at Schmeichel’s admission that “it would be silly for someone like me to put more pressure on him” less than a minute after comparing him to one of the greatest Premier League goalkeepers of all time.",
      "We get that he was asked about him and Lammens might not even be aware of what he’s said, but plenty of fans will have heard that and many will have read the article published by the official Manchester United website titled ‘LAMMENS: KEEPER OF PROMISE”. Again, after one actual game of football.",
      "We love a kneekerk reaction, and balls in a vice, we would say Lammens looks like the real deal. But we have no skin in the game. If anything, another United goalkeeper being terrible is much more fun and thus more clickable for the majority of our readers.",
      "Maybe Schmeichel and the rest of the cabal of United pundits are of a similar mind. Is it in their best interests for their former club to continue being a mess? If it’s not, we really think they should avoid comparing a goalkeeper with one Premier League appearance to another who’s won it four times.",

      "We’re still not entirely sure which way Tottenham’s first Premier League season under Thomas Frank will eventually break. Underlying numbers hint that they are defying gravity a bit with their four wins and 14 points, but there is undeniably a new-found steel about this very work-in-progress side.",
      "The glass half-full approach to it all is that Spurs have racked up a goodly number of points despite very obviously not yet entirely working out how best to go about marrying defensive steel and long-ball football with attacking thrust and craft in the many games where they will inevitably dominate the ball and the onus is on them to take the initiative.",
      "One early quirk of the season is just how much more effective they’ve been on the road than at home. They’ve now taken 10 points from trips to Man City, West Ham, Brighton and Leeds which is clearly a return any club would settle for.",
      "It’s comfortably the best away record in the league at this time, with the only other team unbeaten away from home – Newcastle – also winless and indeed goalless away from home.",
      "And yet Spurs have managed only four points from home games against Burnley, Bournemouth and Wolves.",
      "The two conspicuously bad league performances have both come in front of their own fans, against Bournemouth and Wolves, creating a truly ludicrous state of affairs: Spurs now have as many Premier League wins in four away games this season as they’ve managed in their last 17 at home.",

      "Xavi Simons showed some more glimpses of getting up to speed with things when finally given a proper chance in a proper No. 10 role with licence to roam wide, while Mathys Tel got a goal that could kickstart something for a player who has yet to show Spurs fans a fraction of what he’s capable of.",
      "But the closest of Spurs’ summer arrivals to serious individual praise is surely Mohammed Kudus, who is looking far more like the player we saw in his first year at West Ham than the second.",
      "Like Tel, there was an element of luck to his first goal of the season thanks to a deflection, yet like Tel he created the opportunity for luck to land on his side in a way perhaps no other player on the pitch could have done.",
      "It’s worth remembering when considering Spurs’ sometimes infuriating lack of creative flair in these early days under Frank that they are still without James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, either one of whom’s availability would go a long way to addressing the issues.",
      "But what they do have in Kudus is a game-changer. Nobody has more than his four Premier League assists this season, and there is already plenty of reason to think that his partnership on the right for Spurs with Pedro Porro is just getting started.",

      "The first and third of those wins came in the Europa – most impressively away at Feyenoord last week – to go with a thoroughly restorative pair of home league wins over Fulham and Burnley.",
      "It’s not changed everything, and the fundamental issues behind the scenes remain ahead of a period when league games against Tottenham, Man City and Liverpool may mean even more heavy lifting is required from the Europa to keep chins up, but it all looks a lot cheerier than it did not even a fortnight ago.",

      "He also filled one of the rare gaps on his Premier League CV with a first goal at the Gtech, leaving Anfield as the only ground he’s played at in the Premier League without scoring.",
      "He now also has 94 Premier League goals – the same career total as Dimitar Berbatov. And the players he’s catching now only get more absurd in their iconic status in this league. He’s only one behind Ruud van Nistelrooy, and three behind Didier Drogba. These are absurd numbers.",

But Postecoglou’s problem is that he has so thoroughly torched all semblance of goodwill in far easier games where his foibles have been more ruthlessly exposed.",
      "Nobody would be calling this result a sacking offence if he’d managed not to lose against Swansea or Sunderland or Midtjylland.",
      "But the response of the home fans at the City Ground on Thursday night was enough to tell you the manager is already on borrowed time, and that no benefit of any doubt will be granted for subsequent defeats. We can’t really think of many comparable examples of fans turning so quickly and viscerally on a manager after their appointment. They don’t expect this to get better, and in fairness to them they have a body of evidence from Postecoglou’s previous Premier League employment that is hard to argue with.",

An inability to play compelling attacking football without fatally exposing the defence, or competent defensive football without abandoning the attack altogether. And always, always, always the apparently fundamental and unresolvable weakness from set-pieces.",

      "Crystal Palace and Chelsea both played well against Liverpool and were worthy winners. But they didn’t really do anything very differently to those other teams who came close to getting something only to be denied at the last.",
      "Liverpool have not been smashed or grabbed by these late goals they’ve conceded. They’ve felt like the natural conclusion to drab and uninspired performances.",
      "And they need to find solutions fast. This is not yet a crisis, but it really does feel like it could be a crisis’ origin story. Their post-interlull fixtures are unhelpful, with league games against Manchester United, Aston Villa and Man City alongside Champions League clashes with Eintracht Frankfurt and Real Madrid plus a Carabao encounter with their newly-minted nemesis Crystal Palace all offering further obvious potential for widening of cracks and deepening of concerns.",

      "Carlos Baleba’s failed summer move to Manchester United has left no winners, with the Brighton star one of this season’s biggest disappointments…",
      "One of this summer transfer window’s most surprising developments came as Man Utd, despite apparently being at risk of going bust by Christmas, made an audacious move for Brighton sensation Baleba.",
      "This provided evidence of the Red Devils, for a change, being notably astute in the transfer market as a No.6 with such a high ceiling as Baleba had the potential to turn Ruben Amorim’s side into a competent team.",
      "One of Man Utd’s many glaring weaknesses is their lack of a mobile No.6 to glue the team together. Baleba would have fixed this problem, but this ‘dream’ scenario proved too good to be true.",
      "With United almost exclusively focusing on overhauling their attack, they did not have £115m left over to sign Baleba. Therefore, they shelved their interest until a later date and also opted against signing an alternative.",
      "The immense lure of Man Utd remains undiminished by their prolonged on-field woes, with Baleba reportedly joining a host of other players in favouring a move to Old Trafford despite being able to do better.",
      "But with Brighton refusing to play ball, Baleba is stuck at the south coast until January at the earliest, and it’s clear that this summer’s events have negatively impacted his performances.",
      "On Sunday, Baleba picked up a yellow card in the 20th minute and, for the third time this season, was hooked off by Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler at half-time, while he is yet to complete 90 minutes amid a string of sub-par performances this term.",
      "This time, Hurzeler claimed post-match that Baleba was subbed “because of the yellow card”, but the Brighton boss has previously accepted that the “incredible” star’s form has dipped following his failed move to Man Utd.",
      "“I’m confident that we will get the best out of him, I think he needs time, he’s a young boy, his development in the last year was incredible.” Hurzeler said.",
      "“Maybe it went a little bit too fast, there was a lot of rumours about him, he played an incredible season, but I always try to be humble with the players.",
      "“Because with young players, it’s normal that there will be some waves in their development, and at the moment, we have a wave, so therefore the only way to get out of it, is to try to keep working hard and try to use every training session you can have and try to get as many minutes on the pitch.”",
      "So, at the moment, the Baleba saga has no winner…",
      "The player is clearly hurting from missing out on a huge pay bump and a desired move to an elite club, which is proven by his uncharacteristic decline at the start of this season.",
      "Man Utd are still lacking a quality No.6, and without such a player, their severe defensive issues will continue to limit their progress under Amorim/his potential replacement.",
      "And Brighton have a seemingly unhappy player performing far from his peak and should Baleba’s issues continue, they would have little choice but to accept his sale for a fee significantly lower than £115m.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in 2026.",
      "In Ruben Amorim’s beloved 3-4-2-1, here’s a team of Premier League players that Man Utd are destined to overpay for next summer.",

      "Ruben Amorim ought to be a sack race shoo-in but Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s thriftiness and the worst start to a Forest reign in a century keeps the Manchester United manager in Ange Postecoglou’s slipstream.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham – even that they managed to make a pig’s ear of – and replaced by sack-race winner Nuno Espirito Santo, who will duly return somewhere in the middle of the pack here in due course.",
      "We can only assume that Potter will therefore replace Postecoglou, Nuno’s replacement at Nottingham Forest, at the City Ground as the Aussie is the favourite to be binned next, replacing Amorim, who is probably still in a job so United can save a few quid on his pay-off.",
      "The managerial merry-go-round has never felt more real.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they haven’t done yet. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "That’s what a pair of back-to-back league defeats sandwiching a European setback will do. One minute you’ve won five games out of five and everyone is handing you another Premier League title, the next you find yourself level with Scott Parker in the Sack Race.",
      "Life comes at you fast when a mini-crisis takes hold.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward but the increasing body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",
      "Postecoglou is the first Forest manager in a hundred years – an actual century – to go winless in his first six matches in charge. And it’s now seven after defeat at Newcastle.",
      "It helps not that he replaced a popular figure but the shadow of Nuno would be no inconvenience if Forest weren’t shipping goals for fun while showcasing all the flaws associated with Angeball. Fifteen goals conceded, seven from set-pieces, is it? Stunning.",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. At Palace, the Dutch stopper kept a clean sheet despite Palace’s 1.59 xG and Forest failed to beat him despite an xG of 1.65. Manchester United were expected to score 2.1 goals, which was roughly what transpired.",
      "",
      "The Italian has the second-highest saves percentage (82.8 per cent) in the league and only two keepers have made more saves. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",

      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award needs to be on his game this term with only Burnley allowing more shots on target than Forest, all while Big John breathes down his neck.

      "Despite this, Romano has revealed Man Utd’s “plan” following the Sunderland game, with Amorim only to lose his job if something “completely crazy happened”.",
      "“What is happening is also that Man Utd won the game against Sunderland and closed all the speculation, at least for the next few weeks, for Ruben Amorim, so they head into the international break way more relaxed,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Amorim saves job in ‘must-win’ game to beg Manchester United question: was all the ‘suffering’ necessary?",
      "“The new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, finally started and got a clean sheet – and so a very good start for Lammens and a very good result for Amorim. As I told you guys, Man Utd were not going to sack Amorim even if Man Utd were going to lose the game against Sunderland. Even in that case, he was not going to be fired.",
      "“That was the plan of Man Utd unless completely crazy things happened, like losing, I don’t know, 3 or 4 or 5-0. But, for example, losing the game, I don’t know, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, something like that – Amorim was not going to be fired.”",
      "On reports linking Man Utd with Gareth Southgate, Romano added: “Man Utd’s message was quite clear and they never contacted other managers.",
      "“I spent basically the last 10 days telling you that Gareth Southgate was in the media, but there was never a concrete negotiation between Man Utd and Southgate or his representatives.",
      "“There is a very good relationship between Southgate and INEOS, but never a negotiation. And Man United wanted to show their support to Amorim.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, like Marcus Rashford, has enjoyed a renaissance since leaving Man Utd on loan, scoring four goals in six games for Serie A side Napoli.",
      "Now, Romano has explained why a permanent move in 2026 is already “almost guaranteed”.",
      "“For Hojlund, I keep telling you guys, the Napoli intention is very clear,” Romano continued.",
      "“Apart from the obligation to buy included in the deal – for €44 million – Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Hojlund and they see him as part of their long-term project.",
      "“It’s a loan with buy option that might become an obligation – but it’s seen by the EU parties involved in this deal as a future permanent transfer, almost guaranteed.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is “having a negative impact on his players” with his post-match comments, according to former staff member.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes has already identified the Premier League boss that he would install as Ruben Amorim’s successor if INEOS decide to sack him.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",
      "Napoli will almost certainly complete the signing of Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund on a permanent deal next summer, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Man Utd are ‘quietly considering’ Unai Emery as their next head coach as Ruben Amorim comes under pressure, according to reports."

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Liverpool) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Bournemouth) – £45m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",
      "=1st) Chelsea and Liverpool (11 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £9.13m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (10 games) – worth around £8.3m",
      "8th) Newcastle (9 games) – worth around £7.47m",

      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "While Forest ponder another managerial change, Ange Postecoglou faces the very real prospect of presiding over the Premier League’s shortest-ever reign.",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",

      "When Ruben Amorim prophesised after his first match in charge of Manchester United that “we are going to suffer for a long period,” he perhaps didn’t realise he was issuing the most egregious understatement in human history.",
      "Before Saturday, that 1-1 draw against Ipswich 314 days ago was the last time Manchester United scored in the opening ten minutes of a Premier League game. And an inability to start strong ranks absurdly low on the list of causes for these unnecessarily agonising year-long growing pains.",
      "But Manchester United failing to build on those leads or even just capitalise on brief moments of ascendancy has been an infuriating trait. So too their incompetence in simply trying to keep a clean sheet.",
      "No-one will be foolish enough to read too far into a 2-0 win over Sunderland secured through goals in the eighth and 31st minutes, buttressed by a stable and secure defensive platform. Not when the infernal search for consecutive Premier League wins will take in a visit to Anfield after the international break.",
      "Yet this was the club’s best performance of the season in a ‘must-win’ game for the manager.",
      "It is, of course, heartening that this Manchester United hierarchy might still be making decisions based on the circumstances of one fixture. If one stunning FA Cup final can keep Erik ten Hag in employment well beyond the glaringly obvious end of his road, setting this eternal restoration project back at least another year or so, then why shouldn’t a home win over promoted opposition secure Amorim’s future for the remainder of the season?",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS brains trust would ideally never learn any lessons ever, perennially extending this exasperating process by ignoring every issue and clinging to all potential positives.",
      "Sure, Old Trafford is surrounded by myriad dumpster fires but at least they’re generating enough light and warmth to save on the energy bill and avert any further redundancies.",
      "It should be said that this was a rare break from the “suffering”. Manchester United were competent against Sunderland. Good, even. Great at times. Mason Mount continues to prove himself to be any manager’s favourite player, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo have formed a tantalising link on the right, and Benjamin Sesko needed only one gilt-edged chance rather than three in succession to score.",
      "And on his Premier League debut, Senne Lammens kept the club’s first clean sheet of the season. He was hardly needed to produce the sort of volume of saves which attracted Manchester United to his ability in the first place, but one confident claim from a high Noah Sadiki cross was greeted with rapturous applause and very possibly a few disbelieving supporters fainting in the stands.",
      "Robin Roefs was once again more outwardly impressive at the other end, tipping a wonderful Bruno Fernandes effort onto the bar in his most eye-catching stop. But Manchester United twice found a way through one of the better defensive teams in this myriad Premier League season and wholly deserved their win.",
      "It is vanishingly rare that everything Amorim touches turns to gold. But the Lammens call, bringing Leny Yoro in for Harry Maguire, even dropping Matheus Cunha for Mount were all vindicated.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo got his 13-minute cameo, Casemiro was substituted before he was given the opportunity to get stupidly sent off, and Amorim managed to both have and eat his cake with a trademark centre-half swap with five minutes remaining as Sunderland laboured to find anything resembling a foothold.",
      "Regis Le Bris even felt compelled to alter his system in the first half to match the hosts with the introduction of large Dan Ballard. Amorim, for once, had no reason to follow suit.",
      "He knows “results dictate everything”. Amorim had ventured into the ever so slightly desperate before the game with his controversial rework of a John Lennon classic, saying: “Imagine if we had won the first game against Arsenal, hadn’t missed the penalty, and had won against Fulham even without playing well.”",
      "His basic point was that winning breeds confidence and fine margins have often been the difference. But it is gloriously quaint to hear the manager of Manchester United essentially say: “Imagine if we had just won these games.”",
      "This weekend and over the international break, they need no such creative thinking. An entirely routine, straightforward victory with no suffering in sight might be the most significant result of Amorim’s reign yet.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is “having a negative impact on his players” with his post-match comments, according to former staff member.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes has already identified the Premier League boss that he would install as Ruben Amorim’s successor if INEOS decide to sack him.",
      "While Forest ponder another managerial change, Ange Postecoglou faces the very real prospect of presiding over the Premier League’s shortest-ever reign.",
      "We all love to laugh at Man Utd players thriving away from Old Trafford, but Liverpool have more players in the top ten Premier League defectors of the season.",
      "Pointing fingers at Arsenal ‘is as hilarious as it is transparent’ after they were able to respond to that Liverpool defeat to ‘muscle’ past the champions.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future."

      "Ahead of Saturday’s game, Amorim has explained why he is not scared to lose his job.",

And, again, most importantly, losing a game that should really have been a comfortable win.",
      "There was an F365 piece recently saying that Ange was ‘speedballing’ his approach and outcome and it was spot on.",
      "Calling for a Manager to lose his job after 6 games is ridiculous but it is clear that the appointment was a mistake and this needs to be corrected before the damage becomes too much.",
      "Marinakis is ruthless, but he’s also very stubborn. I hope the former wins when deciding what to do.",
      "No idea who his replacement will or should be though. Probably Southgate, not sure about that one but he definitely can’t be worse.",
      "Ange out.\nJames",
      "",
      "Dear Ed,",
      "One for the mailbox, might be a little long and serious but I do think at some point someone needs to say it…",
      "There is a lot being being written (not-unreasonably) about the odd start to Liverpool’s season with the conclusion generally being reached landing somewhere between ‘lots of new players is hard’ and ‘weird innit?’",
      "However I would suggest that we might all be (understandably) having a great big semi-willful blind spot about the real reason, namely that these guys have all just lost one of their team mates in a genuinely tragic way. And the way that we aren’t able to talk about this is a problem.",
      "We’ve probably all read about and then tried to ignore all of the stuff about men’s mental health and the epidemic of male suicide that we’re currently living in the middle of, and it is an epidemic any way you look at it – up by 30% in the last 10 years, now the leading cause of death for men under 50 and male suicide now counts for 80% of all suicide. And the best, only, way we have of combating this is to be able to talk about bad things that happen when they happen, but we’re crap at it.",
      "Diogo Jota’s death is tragic on many levels, firstly and most obviously to his family, friends and those who knew him and that’s what the Liverpool players are dealing with at the moment. Grief is hard and it comes at you sideways and repeatedly. The idea that the players dealt with his death with one emotional evening at Anfield and then moved on is madness, but we all struggle to talk about the fact that the pain for the players (and fans) is still there and will be for a good while yet.",
      "Their heads aren’t clearly not in it and we have to be able to say that out loud and understand that that’s both really sad but also completely okay and normal (and then, crucially, not murder them for it on social media and in the press).",
      "When the autobiographies come out in a few years time and we learn the real story behind this season it’ll be obvious that the thing affecting the start of this season wasn’t the new formation or Florian Wirtz getting up to the speed of the league, it was, as it clearly is, a group of people struggling with how to cope with a tragedy. And the way we all keep ignoring it in the conversation just shows how far we still have to go in learning to communicate with each other when things go South.",
      "We have to find a way to talk about this stuff lads, and that includes our professional media folk.",
      "RIP Diogo Jota and ASK YOUR MATES IF THEY ARE OKAY – one of you can save a life this weekend.\nMatt",
      "",
      "With his goal on Wednesday night, Nick Woltemade has now scored more champions league goals than Sunderland FC.",
      "Chris \nNUFC",
      "",
      "Brilliant to see all the Pool fans panicking and testing to explain away how awful and lucky they’ve been so far this season. Long may it continue.",
      "At least the “next year will be our year” banter isn’t that long ago so it should be easy to remember.\nWeldoninhio, BAC"

      "\"There's too many defeats, the record's too poor so I don't think anybody will be celebrating too much tonight at Manchester United but I think they'll be relieved that there is a victory which allows a little bit of peace going into the international break.",

      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",

      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",

      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Tuesday 30 September 2025 17:00, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb says it was \"good use of VAR\" to overturn Arsenal's 'penalty' at Newcastle and explains Nick Pope's challenge on Viktor Gyokeres was \"quite different\" to the foul committed by Chelsea's Robert Sanchez that saw him sent off a week prior.",
      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",
      "Referee Jarred Gillett initially gave a penalty for the challenge; however, VAR Darren England recommended an on-field review. After around three minutes, Gillett then announced the decision had been overturned.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Mikel Arteta were critical of the decision after the game. The pair questioned how it was deemed 'clear and obvious' to overturn the decision.",
      "REF: On-field decision is a penalty. Nick Pope, a trip by Nick Pope.",
      "VAR: OK, checking the on-field decision of penalty.",
      "VAR: Got a better angle?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, I've got a better angle from behind here.",
      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system,\" Carragher explained on Monday Night Football. \"They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.\"",
      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",
      "\"It could not have gone any worse and I feel for him. He is a young manager and he has had a great start to his career, what he did at Sporting Lisbon was really special. But those results for a club of that stature are just beyond belief.",
      "\"You don't want to see anybody lose their job but I think it would just be better for everyone if they just shake hands and move on.\"",
