      "Rio Ferdinand has told Manchester United to forget about signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin and put their faith in wonderkid Chido Obi. Calvert-Lewin, 28, is currently without a club after his contract with Everton expired in June.",
      "The striker has been linked with a free transfer to Old Trafford as well as Newcastle and Leeds, with aspirations to rediscover his best form and play for England at the World Cup next summer. United have, of course, already signed a new striker during the summer transfer window, winning the race for RB Leipzig hotshot Benjamin Sesko in a £74million deal.",
      "But unlike Calvert-Lewin, Sesko has no Premier League experience and it's been speculated that the Red Devils are considering making the ex-Everton star a contract offer. It's safe to say that Ferdinand would be against the move, as he wants to see 17-year-old Obi given minutes instead.",
      "When it was put to the former United defender that Calvert-Lewin could be a target for the Red Devils, Ferdinand replied on his YouTube channel: \"Dominic Calvert-Lewin? What are you chatting about, bruv?",
      "\"Calvert-Lewin can't stay fit. No. Why would we bring him in to this club? This club is built on the academy and we've got Chido Obi sitting there.",
      "\"Play him if you just need someone for a few games rather than someone who's older and can't stay fit. Sign Calvert-Lewin? On what grounds? No, I'm sorry, I disagree massively, I disagree massively. What message does that send to the rest of the Premier League or more importantly to your squad?\"",
      "Obi was given his debut by United boss Ruben Amorim in February and made five further appearances before the end of last season. The Dane rose to prominence after scoring an incredible 32 goals in just 18 games for Arsenal's under-18 side before joining the Red Devils for a nominal fee last year.",
      "Denmark manager Brian Riemer recently labelled Obi 'insanely exciting', telling Viaplay, as quoted by Tipsbladet: \"He is in a place now where it is insanely exciting, but he has to make his breakthrough. That is the next step he has to focus on: breaking through at Manchester United. And from there he is a player who would be extremely interesting.\"",
      "Ferdinand's comments come as United prepare to sell Rasmus Hojlund to AC Milan. Hojlund has been shoved down the pecking order by the arrival of Sesko, having endured two difficult seasons with the Red Devils following his £72m move from Atalanta.",
      "The deal would be worth around £40m, potentially funding United's business in other areas. Amorim is reportedly targeting a midfielder, with Brighton star Carlos Baleba high on his shortlist.",
      "A goalkeeper could also be signed to provide competition for Andre Onana. Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been linked, although Manchester City are the favourites to land his signature and are said to have agreed personal terms.",
      "In addition to Hojlund, United are willing to sell Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, who all weren't involved in the club's pre-season tour of the USA. Amorim's side begin their Premier League campaign at home to Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford must get more selfish in front of goal if he's going to succeed at Barcelona. That's according to Micah Richards, who told the former Manchester United player to his face as he criticised his shortcomings up front.",
      "United outcast Rashford, 27, has joined the reigning La Liga champions for the season after spending the second half of last term on loan at Aston Villa. And he's already got his account up and running under Hansi Flick after scoring and assisting in Barca's last two pre-season fixtures.",
      "Once seen as the golden child of Old Trafford, Rashford has been sent out on loan after the goals dried up in Manchester. And Richards pointed out what he sees as an obvious flaw in his game on The Rest Is Football podcast.",
      "\"One criticism from me in your game is I feel like you can be more selfish,\" said the former Manchester City star. \"Because you're getting into great areas, then you always want to pass! All the other players [at the] top of world football are shooting.\"",
      "Rashford appeared to show understanding for the critique but responded by suggesting his priorities aren't solely scoring goals. The 62-cap England international scored a career-high 30 goals during the 2022/23 campaign under Erik ten Hag before a falling out with United successor Ruben Amorim appeared to affect his performance.",
      "\"Don't get me wrong, I love scoring goals and stuff, but this is why I can't consistently be a No. 9,\" he replied. \"Because it's not natural for me to do that, so if I am doing that, I feel like I'm forcing it. And I know that I'm missing other pictures of the game.",
      "\"Like, if I was just playing freely, I'd be seeing these pictures, so there [are] a lot of times when I don't shoot because I feel like the chance of it being blocked and missing a chance for the team, rather than just for me, is pretty high. But also the striker in me is like, 'If I can get it through his legs here [laughs], there's a high chance of it going in!'\"",
      "Those comments may cause consternation with some United fans, many of whom will have seen the scoring potential in the player. Rashford soared through the club's academy playing as a striker and burst onto the senior circuit in 2016 with a reputation for his cool finishing.",
      "The player showed a willingness to help the team when shifted out to the flanks in order to create room for others to play more centrally. And his game has been modified as a result, even though he still has the capacity to play as a more regimented centre forward.",
      "That instinct was on full display when he scored his first Barcelona goal in a recent friendly against South Korean club Daegu. The forward capped the 5-0 rout by flashing a powerful drive past the goalkeeper from the penalty spot following a cut-back from ex-Man City defender Eric Garcia.",
      "He followed up by notching his first Barca assist in the Joan Gamper Trophy, another dominant 5-0 win over Italian club Como. However, that match also saw Rashford left with egg on his face after missing a wide open goal at the back post.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand was stunned by suggestions Manchester United could sign free agent Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The former England international is currently without a club after his contract at Everton expired this summer.",
      "However, the centre-forward believes a move to Old Trafford is possible and recently sacked his agent so he could potentially negotiate his own move. The Red Devils recently signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig for an initial £66.4million, but they may yet need a back-up striker, with Rasmus Hojlund being linked with a move to AC Milan.",
      "When he heard about the speculation linking Calvert-Lewin to a move to Ruben Amorim's side, Ferdinand was anything but convinced. On his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the legendary United defender was told the 28-year-old could be an option by co-host Stephen Howson, who also said the club should sign him over keeping hold of Hojlund. Baffled, Ferdinand replied: \"Dominic Calvert-Lewin, what are you chatting about?\"",
      "Ferdinand also believes Amorim should put faith in 17-year-old academy graduate Chido Obi, adding: \"Dominic Calvert-Lewin cannot stay fit. Why are you bringing him into this club?",
      "\"This club is built on the academy. You have Chido Obi just sitting there. Play him if you're going to think about five or six games. Not somebody who is older and cannot stay fit.\"",
      "With Amorim now having Sesko, alongside new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, as well as the existing Joshua Zirkzee, Ferdinand believes that Obi may only be required for a few matches next season. Last season saw Calvert-Lewin sidelined for 15 matches due to injury, including every match from January 26 to May 5.",
      "He managed to net just three goals in 26 Premier League appearances for the Toffees. Back in 2019, when he was at the top of his game, United were rumoured to be considering a £50m bid for Calvert-Lewin, who has scored four times in 11 international appearances for England.",
      "Now the situation is entirely different, with the striker currently without a club. A move to United could soon be on the cards for him, as Hojlund is reportedly open to a move to AC Milan.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed out over £200m on Cunha, Mbeumo, Sesko and young defender Diego Leon. They've also been courting Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who is thought to be valued by the Seagulls at around £100m.",
      "Calvert-Lewin could turn out to be a cost-effective solution for Amorim and his team. United's campaign kicks off with a massive showdown against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "This is followed by a challenging away game at Fulham, before welcoming newly promoted Burnley. The pressure will then ramp up even further as they head to the Etihad Stadium for the Manchester Derby, before hosting Chelsea, who have looked formidable in the summer after clinching the Club World Cup and comfortably defeating Bayer Leverkusen and AC Milan in pre-season.",

      "Golf and tennis correspondent. Also lots of football",
      "Instead of facing Tottenham in the Super Cup in his homeland tonight, the best shot-stopping goalkeeper in Europe is up for sale.",
      "And the signing of the giant Gianluigi Donnarumma by Chelsea or Manchester City would boost their Premier League title hopes or make Manchester United genuine Champions League candidates. The 6ft 5in stopper, with the wingspan of a 747, will have that size of impact at his next club.",
      "The Italian captain - who announced he will be leaving PSG on Tuesday - first tormented English fans by saving spot kicks from Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka in the Euro 2020 final penalty shootout.",
      "And the former Milan keeper, still only 26, caused heartbreak for Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal fans as he inspired Paris Saint-Germain to their first Champions League trophy.",
      "But only 73 days after the French club’s triumph over Inter Milan - and only five days after he was the only goalkeeper named in the Ballon D’Or shortlist - Donnarumma’s career at PSG is over in ruthless fashion.",
      "While the Champions League winners flew to Udine to face the Europa Cup winners yesterday, the Italy goalkeeper trained alone at the back at the Campus PSG while the club awaits offers for his signature.",
      "Last season’s all-action hero, popular with his fellow players and fans, will not play for the Qatari-owned club again. At least Marie Antoinette had a trial before she was guillotined in Paris.",
      "Donnarumma is out of contract next summer and year-long negotiations to agree a new deal have now stopped. He signed on a free transfer from Milan in 2021 on a gross salary of €10m (£8.64m). After tax breaks and bonuses, his current net annual salary has been £6.5m.",
      "PSG are now offering players lower basic wages with more performance-related bonuses and Donarumma refused the effective pay cut despite his desire to remain in the City of Light.",
      "There was a similar standoff with Kylian Mbappe two summers ago when he refused to sign a new deal and he was excluded from a summer tour to Asia. He was reintegrated back into the group after giving up millions of Euros in bonuses and then used less after Christmas when it was clear he was still leaving for Real Madrid.",
      "This time PSG have already signed Donnarumma’s replacement. Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year Lucas Chevalier joined this weekend in a €55m deal from Lille, the former club of PSG director of football Luis Campos. And the 23-year-old was bought with the backing of Luis Enrique and guaranteed he will be No.1.",
      "The PSG announcement welcoming the signing of Chevalier claimed he is: “Comfortable on his line, in one-on-one situations, and in the air, he also has excellent distribution skills”.",
      "It was interpreted by the Italian media and Donnarumma’s camp as a dig at the Azzurri keeper’s ability with his feet. Former Milan keeper Christian Abbiati told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"There's something crazy about all this. I would say he won more than half the Champions League for them. And yet, from what I hear, it seems he's bad with his feet.",
      "\"We can say that there are many players better with their feet than him, but from there to replacing a goalkeeper who has put a Champions League title in your trophy cabinet! In Europe he's made unbelievable saves, saves that few would have been capable of making.",
      "“Someone of his calibre will certainly land on his feet and go to another big club, although it's a shame he has to end like this. I wish him the best because he deserves it.\"",

      "Manchester United's frontline has been transformed by an impressive summer of recruitment with three new faces setting them back more than £200million.",
      "The capture of Benjamin Sesko, presented to Old Trafford on Saturday, means Ruben Amorim has addressed the lack of goals in his team last season. With the season fast approaching it is unlikely that any new faces will arrive before they play Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "However Amorim has made it clear he would like a new midfielder with Brighton's Carlos Baleba continuing to be linked with a move to Manchester. He's excelled at the Amex but, given the fee the Seagulls would demand, there's an acceptance that any deal could prove challenging.",
      "PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma is another player who could be on the move with the Parisians leaving him out of their squad for this week's European Super Cup. PSG are open to his exit with United among those keen. Here's the latest news lines from the Red Devils.",
      "Manchester United supporters group The 1958 has pulled the plug on a planned protest. The group had planned to march against Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership ahead of United's opening Premier League game, against Arsenal. Their decision comes just days after Sesko joined the club. The striker signing in a deal worth up to £74m.",
      "In early August, The 1958 shared plans for a protest while claiming \"shiny new signings\" shouldn't distract from minority owner Ratcliffe's involvement. However, following a mixed response to the announcement, the group then put the plans to its membership.",
      "While the majority of those surveyed agreed Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS should be judged on what they have delivered, some 68 percent felt they deserved more time to show what they can do. In announcing the postponement of the march, The 1958 published a breakdown of the voting.",
      "The Red Devils have issued winger Antony with an ultimatum as the Brazilian attempts to secure a move to Real Betis. The club have demanded the Brazilian winger to accept a transfer offer this week or risk remaining on the sidelines at Old Trafford until January.",
      "The La Liga side want to see the former Ajax man return to the club but want to hang on until the final moments of the transfer window to close a deal with United for a loan with option or obligation to buy.",
      "But those on the red side of Manchester want to seal an exit, according to reports in Spain, and have already received offers that they would deem financially suitable and do not want to regard Betis as their only option.",
      "Robert Lewandowski has revealed that he \"said yes\" to the opportunity to move to Manchester to play under Sir Alex Ferguson - only for the move never to happen. The Barcelona star has been one of Europe's outstanding No 9s for more than a decade, but a different path may have seen him play at Old Trafford under the Scot in his final year as a manager.",
      "It was in 2012 that he gave the green light to move to Manchester from Borussia Dortmund for what would've been the final spell of Ferguson's stint in Manchester. The interest came off the back of a season where Lewandowski claimed the Bundesliga title, scoring 30 times.",
      "The Polish star told the BBC: \"To Manchester United I decided and said yes. I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.\"",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has put Premier League sides on red alert after announcing his departure from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Donnarumma has been told he doesn't have a future at PSG by manager Luis Enrique and has said goodbye in a fiery statement on Instagram. \"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success,” he said. \"I am disappointed and disheartened.”",
      "Earlier in the day, Enrique had confirmed that Donnarumma had been dropped from the squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham on Wednesday night. “Donnarumma is out of the squad as it’s my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible,\" said Enrique.",
      "“I want a different kind of goalkeeper and I made this decision. Gigio is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world. The life of a top-level footballer, and the same goes for us coaches, is this: it wasn’t an easy decision but I take full responsibility for it.”",
      "Donnarumma is still only 26 years old and, as a European champion with Italy in 2021 and a Champions League winner with PSG in May, the goalkeeper shouldn’t be short of suitors.",
      "The most recent noises have been coming out of the Etihad, where Pep Guardiola is said to have a soft spot for Donnarumma. There has been a lot of movement in the goalkeeping department at City this summer, with rumours of a possible departure for Ederson to Galatasaray followed by the club re-signing James Trafford for £31m from Burnley.",
      "Late on Tuesday night came news, via L’Equipe, that Donnarumma had agreed personal terms with City. The Italy international is understood to be very keen on a move to City, who will now have to negotiate a fee with PSG.",
      "By making their desire to offload Donnarumma public and promote new keeper Lucas Chevalier, PSG have backed themselves into a corner, yet reportedly value him at £43million.",
      "Donnarumma’s contract expires in less than a year so City will surely try to negotiate that fee downwards. His arrival would surely mean the end to Ederson’s eight-year stay at the club and would mean Trafford once again taking a backseat at his boyhood club.",
      "Question marks over the form of Andre Onana at United have been a constant almost ever since his arrival from Ajax – and things came to a head last season. Ruben Amorim was forced to take Onana out of the firing line after a mistake-filled performance against Lyon in the Europa League, but his replacement Altay Bayindir was no better.",
      "United reportedly contacted Aston Villa to enquire about the availability of Emi Martinez earlier this summer, while they have also been linked with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens.",
      "Donnarumma has always appeared to be an ambitious target, given United’s lack of European football and 15th-placed finish last season. The club have distanced themselves from a move for him, which would seem unlikely anyway.",
      "One problem is United’s lack of available funds. Donnarumma fell out with PSG after demanding a bumper new contract and United would need to offload some of their unwanted players before adding to their £200m summer spending spree. Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are their most valuable assets in that regard.",
      "Robert Sanchez has never convinced as Chelsea goalkeeper, who made an attempt to sign Mike Maignan earlier this summer. The Blues have sold Djordje Petrovic to Bournemouth for £25m, sent Kepa Arrizabalaga to Arsenal for £5m and let Marcus Bettinelli go to City.",
      "They still have Filip Jorgensen and Mike Penders on their books, with the latter highly-rated and currently on loan at Strasbourg for the season. Chelsea are reportedly content with their options – and the move for Maignan was an opportunistic one, rather than a planned one.",
      "But the chance to sign Donnarumma, who would clearly be an upgrade on the error-prone Sanchez, might change their minds. Sanchez improved at the end of last season and fits Enzo Maresca’s ethos of playing out from the back, yet will always have a blunder in him.",

      "PSG have named their squad for the Super Cup against Tottenham Hotspur, who beat United in the Europa League final in May and Donnarumma isn't in it. Chevalier has been joined by Matvey Safonov and Renato Marin, with last season's first choice keeper nowhere to be seen.",
      "His absence has prompted increased talk of a Premier League switch, with United, Manchester City and Chelsea strongly linked with him, with City said the be front-runners according to reports in France.",
      "United, meanwhile, are distancing themselves from reports of their interest. Ruben Amorim's side have shown ambition by spending £200m on a flurry of attacking talent, but aren't in Europe this season, something which is a key requirement of Donnarummma's.",
      "Chelsea had also been linked with Donnarumma, but the Blues are believed to be happy with current keepers Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Belgian youngster Mike Penders is also highly regarded in West London, and is spending the current season on loan at Strasbourg.",
      "According to reports in Italy, Galatasaray and Bayern Munich are among the other clubs able to match the Italian's wage demands. Both clubs are involved in the Champions League, with Gala already flexing their muscles with big contracts for Victor Osimhen and Leroy Sane.",
      "If United did move for Donnarumma, it would likely mean an exit for one of Andre Onana or Altay Bayindir. Turkish keeper Bayindir has played regularly in pre-season as Onana works his way back to full fitness, but the Cameroon international may be ready to return against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "\"For us, it doesn't matter which team we will play,\" Bayindir told club media after helping United beat Fiorentina on penalties on Saturday. \"Every game is important in the Premier League. This week, we will work for Arsenal, and then from the Arsenal game, step by step for the next game, we will prepare ourselves.\"",
      "United's opponents have added a new keeper themselves this summer, though he is unlikely to start on Sunday. Spanish international Kepa Arrizabalaga joined in a cut-price move from Chelsea, but remains second choice behind David Raya.",
      "The Sunday clash will also allow Viktor Gyokeres to face off against his former manager Ruben Amorim. A reunion for the ex-Sporting pair had looked possible early in the window, but Gyokeres instead moved to North London in a £64m deal.",

      "Chelsea and both Manchester clubs have been linked with a move for the 26-year-old, and on Tuesday night he announced he would be leaving the French capital in a fiery statement on Instagram.",
      "\"To the special Paris fans, From the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success.",
      "\"I am disappointed and disheartened. I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done.",
      "\"If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it. I will always carry with me the memory of all the emotions, the magical nights, and of you, who made me feel at home.",
      "\"To my teammates – my second family – thank you for every battle, every laugh, every moment we shared. You will always be my brothers. Playing for this club and living in this city has been an immense honour. Thank you, Paris.\"",

      "“Donnarumma is out of the squad as it’s my own decision. I am 100 per cent responsible,\" said Enrique. \"I want a different kind of goalkeeper and I made this decision. Gigio is one of the best goalkeepers in the whole world.",
      "“The life of a top-level footballer, and the same goes for us coaches, is this: it wasn’t an easy decision but I take full responsibility for it. On the other hand, if these choices were easy, anyone could make them.”",

      "Gary Neville has claimed Manchester United can finish in the top six if their three new strikers notch 40 goals - and they get another goalkeeper to keep them out at the other end.",
      "Ruben Amorin’s side finished 15th last season after scoring only 44 goals in Premier League games. But the £73.7m signing of Slovene Benjamin Seska has taken their summer spending on strikers to over £200m following the arrival of Bryan Mbeumbo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "And former Reds defender Neville believes there will have to be an improvement on the last torrid campaign. “I think they'll be looking at Champions League, I think that'll be the ambition,” he said. “I think we've gone past the point now where we say Manchester United have to win the league, I think that's unrealistic.",
      "“I think top six would be healthy, I think that my feeling is probably between seventh, eighth is where I'm looking at it now, but I think they could, without Europe, they could get into the top six if they have a good run, and those players settling up front, which I'm actually quite happy about the players they've signed up front.",
      "“I didn't think they had the £200 million to spend. If you said to me after that Tottenham game in the Europa League that Manchester United would have a forward line of those three that they've signed, I'd have snapped your hand off. I like the profile of those players, whether they settle in now is obviously the big question.",
      "\"Two of them are proven Premier League players, obviously they've got to step up a level, Sesko's young, he's got potential. He's young, can he get off to a good start? That's important for him.",
      "“Can they embed themselves at United? Can they get the probably 35-40 goals which would be par for those three players? If they can get 40 goals, United's goals last season was terrible, they've got a good chance of getting into that top six, but they've got to settle those three players, and we can't take that for granted anymore at United. If they get a goalkeeper, I think that they could get into the top six, but a lot of things have to go on.”",
      "Manchester United conceded 54 Premier League goals to finish the season with a goal difference of -10. Paris-Saint Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is available for £30m - and big wages - as an upgrade from Andre Onana.",
      "Amorin will also have more time to work with his players without European football. Antonio Conte took Chelsea from 10th to champions in his first season in 2016-17.",
      "“I think it'll help, it has to help, because there's basically more training time, less pressure on the players, less injuries, it means that the best players can play more often in the league, and not have those demands of a Thursday night game,” Neville said. “But I think we've got to start the season well, there were some tough fixtures early on.”",
      "“It's a big game, we're out for Arsenal,” he said. “I think there's going to be that much pressure on Arsenal, just because we're in year five now, I think it's year six, and it just feels like right from the start everyone's eyes are on them. so I don't think it's a great game actually for Arsenal, to kick off the season as well, because of the situation that they're in, where it just feels like all eyes are on them from the very start.",
      "“I'm not saying it's Premier League or bust, that type of thing, because I actually think Mikel Artel has done a brilliant job, and to be second, year after year, people sort of sneer at him, Arsenal finish second again, but there's a lot of good clubs in this, so to second every year is not a mean feat.",
      "“I think it would be good for them to get some sort of trophy. I think they had a good result in their last pre-season match but I think the one before that, they lost at home, and there was a few murmurs in the crowd. It's not just people outside, people in the stadium are worried. It's like: ‘This has to happen now’.”",

      "Jadon Sancho has been bombarded by messages from Besiktas fans on social media after the Turkish side emerged as an escape route for the Manchester United reject.",
      "Sancho has been exiled at United, where Ruben Amorim has placed him and other unwanted players in a so-called ‘bomb squad’. He, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been told to follow in the footsteps of Marcus Rashford by finding a new club.",
      "The 25-year-old winger has been linked with moves to Juventus, Fenerbahce and Borussia Dortmund, but a move is yet to materialise. His £300,000-a-week wages at United, where he is under contract until June 2026, have proven problematic in the market.",
      "However, speculation has ramped up once more with the news that both Roma and Besiktas are actively pursuing a deal for Sancho. New Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini is keen on signing him, while former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants a reunion with him in Istanbul.",
      "Besiktas has something that Roma doesn’t: an army of online supporters out to persuade Sancho to move to Turkey. His latest Instagram post, which shows photos of him relaxing on holiday has racked up over 5million comments, the vast majority of which simply read: “Come to Besiktas”.",
      "And the club’s president Serdal Adali is willing to follow through with the fans’ wishes. “Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” he told Turkiye Today. “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "“Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”",
      "Sancho spent last season on loan with Chelsea, but the club turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services. He then agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce and Juventus, only for those deals to collapse and former United striker Teddy Sheringham is worried his career is on the downslide.",
      "“Jadon Sancho will definitely not play for a big club ever again. He will probably tell you that he can and he will but not for me,” Sheringham told Snabbare. “I see that he's burned his bridges with the manager. He’s not even got a place in the changing room.",
      "“Maybe if he’d be given another chance he could work for what Amorim wants but I know from experience once you've gone down that path of being unhappy and wanting out that it's very hard to turn it around with the manager, with the supporters, with the other players.",
      "“You've got to show an unbelievable mental desire to turn that around. It can be done, and I know he's a talented lad, but I would be very, very surprised if that was the case now.”",

But sometimes things don't work out and you cannot explain specifically what it is.",

      "A number of Manchester United's players have been in contact with Brighton's Carlos Baleba about the prospect of him moving to Old Trafford in the final weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Last week the Red Devils expressed an interest in the player, who has seen his stock rise with the Seagulls. He is the latest player to move to the Amex as a relatively unknown quantity before becoming a huge hit and those in Manchester are now circling.",
      "The Cameroon midfielder will have played with Andre Onana at international level and was previously team-mates with Leny Yoro at Lille. Several of the United squad have been in contact to explain the current landscape and ambitions, reports the Athletic.",
      "Baleba played in both of Brighton's wins over the Manchester outfit last season and was one of the most impressive players in his position across the Premier League. United though accept that any deal may be hard to strike given the numbers involved.",
      "Having already spent more than £200million on new signings there is not huge amounts of budget left. The club are not expected to submit a bid for Baleba unless they believe there is a chance of success as they continue with indirect conversations.",
      "Brighton have already sold Joao Pedro to Chelsea for £60m, lessening their need to sell. The Seagulls also want to retain their top talent and the price they slap on Baleba may curtail United's hopes of getting a deal over the line. The last time the south coast side sold a player of Baleba's profile it was Moises Caicedo - who left for more than £100m.",
      "The Cameroonian himself has shown no great desire to leave the Amex and Brighton. Their chief executive Paul Barber recently played down speculation about Baleba making the move to Manchester.",
      "He said: \"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",

      "The Brighton star has been attracting interest throughout the summer window, and Amorim's team is currently assessing Baleba's willingness to join United and the salary price point required to tempt him into a switch. The Seagulls, though, have no current plans to sell the 21-year-old.",
      "A number of current United stars have contacted Baleba about a move to Old Trafford as part of a charm offensive to convince him to head to the north west. It comes as United learn they could have snapped up the young midfielder for a staggering £81m less than they'll have to pay now if they'd landed him two years ago.",
      "At the time of Baleba's transfer to Brighton in 2023, the then-19-year-old was starring for Lille and shining as a defensive midfielder against the likes of Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain. Many clubs had been linked to the young Cameroonian, but the Seagulls came out on top, snapping him up for £23m and tying him down to a five-year deal.",
      "This contract, which lasts until 2028 with the option of a further year, is the leverage that the Seagulls will use to ensure they get the best deal for Baleba should he push for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The young holding midfielder is considered a long-term replacement for veteran star Casemiro, who is unlikely to be a permanent fixture in the United squad this season.",
      "Amorim has already splashed the cash this summer, securing the signatures of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined total of over £200m. And it would take a huge bid of £104m to unstick Brighton from their stance on Baleba.",
      "Speaking on United's transfer business in July, Amorim said: \"Cunha and Bryan, they had different solutions [offers]. They had Champions League offers. And they wanted to come here. People that say that they come here because of the money… that is a lie. That I know for sure. So, I’m really happy with that.",

      "Manchester United have already received a ringing endorsement of new striker Benjamin Sesko from Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek. The Red Devils signed the RB Leipzig forward in a deal worth up to £74million, with Sesko penning a five-year contract at Old Trafford.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is hoping Sesko can lead his new-look attack alongside Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. The 22-year-old is considered one of Europe's most exciting centre-forwards and joins United after netting 21 goals for Leipzig across all competitions last season.",
      "The striker was on Arsenal's radar earlier this summer and ultimately opted to sign for the Red Devils over a move to Newcastle United. Slovenia boss Kek has witnessed Sesko's development over the last four years and knows exactly what the striker will offer United.",
      "\"From time to time, I have to stop him a bit and calm him down: it's just the amazing energy [that he has],\" Kek told Italian reporters ahead of Euro 2024. \"He is like a magnet, and such a positive one.",
      "\"It is clear that his likeability and splendid public appearances are making it known to little boys and girls that there is a lot of work, training, and sacrifices behind this [success].\"",
      "It appears Sesko's impressive attitude will slot seamlessly into the atmosphere Amorim is building at United. On the field, despite regularly playing alongside the physical Aleksandar Mitrovic for his country, Kek highlighted Sesko's commanding presence up front - a quality that will only have developed further over the past year.",
      "\"We're talking about a physically strong centre-forward who has made great progress, also technically, month after month. He came to [the national team] when he was just a lad: a 17-year-old boy, and since then I have been watching him grow into a man. He has become a very important part of the team.",
      "\"Despite his youthfulness, he carries a sort of energy - the character of a diligent boy who would train day and night to achieve his goal.\"",
      "Kek gave Sesko his Slovenia debut the day after his 18th birthday, with the forward netting 16 times in 41 appearances for his country. Sesko's new boss Amorim agreed with Kek's verdict before seeing the striker in action for United.",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed,\" Amorim told MUTV. \"Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important.",
      "\"He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels, and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. For sure, he is going to feel at home in our club. He is the right character in this group, so we are really, really happy to have him.\"",
      "\"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special, but what really excites me is the future,\" Sesko said after joining the club. \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my teammates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "In an effort to determine how to deal with a dilemma like Alexander Isak, Eddie Howe could do worse than mimic the example set by Sir Alex Ferguson. Newcastle find themselves with a wantaway superstar desperate to leave the club for pastures new, as Manchester United did when Cristiano Ronaldo showed a liking towards Real Madrid in 2008.",
      "Isak, 25, has made no secret of his desire to leave St. James' Park, which has led to him being frozen out of the squad on the eve of the new Premier League campaign. The Athletic reported Isak, who was already the subject of a rejected £120million bid from Liverpool, is \"adamant\" he'll never play in black and white again, having grown despondent after learning he won't yet be offered a new contract.",
      "The details are different, but certain aspects of the stand-off closely resemble United's predicament with Ronaldo 17 years ago. The Portugal talisman had just led the Red Devils to Champions League glory, prompting then-Real president Ramon Calderon to publicly proclaim his intention to make the world-beater one of his own.",
      "Ferguson, 83, didn't take kindly to the declaration and informed his player as such, though there was a caveat to his defiance. Writing in his 2013 memoir, 'My Autobiography', the Scot struck a secret agreement with the five-time Ballon d'Or-winner that he would remain for one more year before being allowed to leave on United's terms.",
      "A passage from the book read: \"I found the boy expressing an urge to go to Real Madrid, and told him, 'You can’t go this year, not after the way Calderon has approached the issue.'",
      "\"I said, ‘I know you want to go to Real Madrid, but I’d rather shoot you than sell you to that guy now. If you perform, don’t mess us about, and someone comes and offers us a world-record fee, then we will let you go.' I had already conveyed that message to his agent, Jorge Mendes.",
      "\"I did well to calm him down. I told him the reason I was refusing to sell him that year was because of Calderon. I said, 'If I do that, all my honour's gone, everything's gone for me, and I don't care if you have to sit in the stands. I know it won't come to that, but I just have to tell you I will not let you leave this year.'\"",
      "The rest is history. Ronaldo saw out one more season at Old Trafford before joining Real for a then-world-record fee of £80m after Florentino Perez took over as Calderon's presidential successor in Madrid.",
      "It ended up being money very well spent on their part, and Ferguson got to keep his honour intact. The same perhaps can't be said for Isak at this rate after reportedly stating his intent to sit in the stands rather than play for Newcastle again.",
      "And if Howe were to replicate Ferguson's line of logic, he may have to make peace with the possibility of Isak seeing out significant game time on the sidelines. It's all but impossible to envision in this day and age, but both Howe and his Saudi bosses have to consider that possibility, with no obvious suitors lining up to meet his supposed £150m price-tag at this stage of the transfer window.",
      "The Swede's alleged act of defiance has angered the talkSPORT duo of Gabby Agbonlahor and Ally McCoist, who criticised his actions on Tuesday. And the pair believe Isak's summer shenanigans, which include missing Newcastle's pre-season tour and training at former club Real Sociedad, have only harmed his appeal in the long run.",
      "Former Aston Villa striker Agbonlahor took aim at Isak after hearing the latest developments and asked: \"Who does he think he is? Disgusting, what that club has done for you.\"",
      "Scottish football icon McCoist hammered home the point by questioning whether Isak's behaviour was becoming of an elite transfer target: \"If you're Liverpool, is that the kind of person you want to be signing?\"",

      "The survey, commissioned by one of Europe's leading real-time scores apps, questioned more than 3,000 football fans on their experiences in 2025. LiveScore uncovered that just 21 per cent of Premier League fans agreed that it was easy to get tickets to watch the action live, with 81 per cent citing availability and pricing as the two biggest stumbling blocks.",
      "The blackout rule was imposed in the 1960s to encourage fans to attend lower league games across the country, and it was protected in the last domestic TV rights deal, which will run until at least 2029. This means that no match can be televised between 2:45pm and 5:25pm on a Saturday until the deal expires.",
      "Many of the additional fixtures are expected to be schedule for Monday and Friday nights, as well as Sundays. It also includes showing multiple 2pm kick-offs on a Sunday, which will often feature clubs participating in the Europa and Conference Leagues.",
      "\"And I see, and when I travel a lot into Europe and spoke with the supporters, meeting fans, the demand is still massive. And it's going to be massive because football is the most popular sport in the world.",
      "\"So it's great that the love for the game is so strong, but of course, it means that sometimes it's difficult to get a ticket. But again, I'm pretty sure that the clubs are always looking for a way to make that happen, improve access, and make sure that the loyal fans get their chance to go to the stadium.\"",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler does not fear losing his Seagulls stars, and is confident his side will continue to find solutions when their stars are sold. Carlos Baleba is the latest standout player to be linked with a move away from the Amex Stadium, with Manchester United the interested party.",
      "The Red Devils have a midfielder next on their agenda after completing a deal for Benjamin Sesko. The £74million transfer followed the additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Brighton have already seen Joao Pedro depart this summer for a substantial sum and waved goodbye to the likes of Alexis Mac Allister and Moises Caicedo in recent seasons. And Hurzeler, 32, is not perturbed at the prospect of that being a pattern that continues heading into the new season.",
      "While the Seagulls head coach pointed to examples of Brighton not exclusively being a selling club, the German boss' stance may provide United with some heart. There was certainly no hands off warning as Hurzeler discussed his squad.",
      "\"We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions,\" Hurzeler told the Monday Night Club. \"That's our model, we have to accept it.",
      "\"I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is earning much less than fellow Premier League newcomer Viktor Gyokeres after rejecting a bigger salary elsewhere to join Manchester United.",
      "Newcastle were keen to sign the Slovenian international and even offered him a higher salary to agree terms, but Sesko opted instead to join Ruben Amorin's project at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko joined United on a five-year deal paying RB Leipzig a potential £74m - £66.4million with £7.6m in add-ons - to finally land a new centre-forward. The 22-year-old will earn around £160,000 per week, just over £8.3m a year. It means Sesko is nowhere near the top earner at Old Trafford, with Casemiro topping the pile, taking home a whopping £350,000 each week and £18.2m annually.",
      "Indeed, Sesko actually left money on the table as he agreed to work under Amorim in Manchester rather than Eddie Howe in the north east, such was his desire to join the Red Devils.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, joined Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon in July in a deal worth £64m. The Swedish striker, who formerly worked under Amorim in Portugal, had a wide range of European clubs monitoring his situation - although few took the plunge to actually negotiate a deal with Sporting - before inking a five-year deal in north London.",
      "The 27-year-old now rakes in a hefty £200,000 per week, or £10.4m a year, at Arsenal before bonuses. Only Declan Rice, Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz earn more at the Emirates as things stand.",
      "Sesko is therefore earning £40,000 less than his fellow newcomer. However, if United make the Champions League qualifying spots this season, then the Slovenian's wages will increase to £200,000 per week, putting him on par with Gyokeres.",
      "Gyokeres is set to bring something that has been distinctly lacking at Arsenal in recent times - goals from a striker. While the Gunners were third in the top-scoring rankings last season, they still scored 22 fewer goals overall than they did in the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The hope at the Emirates is that it will be the determining factor in winning a first title in over 20 years. Gyokeres could well be the man for the job, given that he scored a whopping 97 goals in 102 matches to help lead Sporting to two league titles during his time with the club.",
      "Discussing Gyokeres' signing and what he will bring, Arteta said: \"Viktor has so many qualities. He is a quick and powerful presence up front, with incredible goalscoring numbers at club and international levels.",
      "\"He brings a clinical edge with a high conversion rate of chances into goals, with his intelligent movement in the box making him a constant threat. We're excited about what Viktor brings to our squad and are looking forward to starting working with him.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko is also promising to bring goals and assists to Man United this season. In the 2024/25 campaign, the Red Devils managed only 44 goals - a serious decline compared to their last second-placed finish in 2021/22, where they scored 73.",
      "With Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo already in the building at Old Trafford, Sesko joins a new-look front line that will be planning to turn United's fortunes around this season. During his short Leipzig career, the young forward scored 39 goals and assisted eight times in 87 games in all competitions.",
      "Discussing his new club, Sesko said: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future. When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "The visit of the Londoners will mark the beginning of Ruben Amorim's first full season as United head coach, and there is an upbeat mood surrounding the club heading into their season opener.",
      "A successful summer transfer window, which has seen four new arrivals, and a positive pre-season campaign means United supporters will be arriving at Old Trafford on confident last season's woes will be banished.",
      "But what could Amorim's matchday squad for the season opener look like?",
      "If Onana wins his fitness battle and gets the green light to start, it will be interesting to see the landscape of the back three he is tasked with marshalling. Leny Yoro is a guaranteed starter after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less certainty about who will join him in defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are competing to start in the middle of the back three and Ayden Heaven is rivalling Luke Shaw to start as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "All four players will believe they are worthy of starting berths, leaving Amorim with a selection dilemma to solve. There is no obvious answer, but De Ligt and Shaw could get the nod after making three starts each during the summer.",
      "Amad and Patrick Dorgu are shoo-ins to occupy the two wing-back positions. The latter came on in leaps and bounds during pre-season, particularly during the tour of the United States, while Amad started all five warm up matches.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is set to occupy one of the two midfield positions. The United captain has regularly flexed his muscles in the engine room and is a guaranteed starter.",
      "However, there is an ongoing debate about who should partner the Portuguese international. Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are the contenders and they all got opportunities to prove their worth during pre-season.",
      "In an ideal world, United will bring in a new midfielder before the transfer window slams shut, but that mission is unlikely to be fulfilled ahead of Sunday's game. It means Ugarte, amid his defensive profile, is the most logical partner for Fernandes.",
      "Mainoo will believe he is worthy of a starting berth, but he is a forward-thinking player, meaning the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield would risk leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Cunha, who scored 17 goals for Wolves last season, should start as the left-sided No.10. Bryan Mbeumo is the obvious pick to fill the other No.10 spot.",
      "Despite only featuring twice in pre-season due to a lack of match sharpness, Mbeumo impressed against both Everton and Fiorentina. He linked up really well with Amad and should be awarded his competitive debut for United from the start.",
      "Supported by Cunha and Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko should come straight into the team and lead the attack. He arrived from RB Leipzig last weekend to provide the final piece in the attacking jigsaw.",
      "As far as the bench is concerned, Amorim has a competitive squad at his disposal, meaning he will have options to turn to. Tom Heaton had a better pre-season than Altay Bayindir and should be promoted to second-choice in the pecking order.",
      "Defensive cover can come from Diogo Dalot, Maguire and Heaven. Mainoo and Casemiro can offer midfield cover and Mason Mount will be able to offer support to Cunha and Mbeumo in the No.10 position.",
      "Unless an exit materialises beforehand, Hojlund should make the bench. Chido Obi should also make the matchday squad against his former club.",
      "United starting XI: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko.",
      "United substitutes: Heaton, Dalot, Maguire, Heaven, Mainoo, Casemiro, Mount, Hojlund, Obi.",

      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining Manchester United face a race against time to get their shopping done.",
      "United have drafted in four new faces so far this summer, bringing in Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and most recently Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The additions of Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko are statement signings that should transform United's attack. Suddenly, last season's biggest weakness looks like being this season's biggest strength.",
      "Although United found the signing of Cunha a simple deal to complete given the £62.5million release clause he had in his Wolves contract, the deals to bring Mbeumo and Sesko to Old Trafford were not quite as smooth.",
      "United spent several weeks locked in discussions with Brentford to sign Mbeumo and they faced stiff competition from Newcastle United for Sesko. However, both players shared the same ambition: they wanted to join United.",
      "Mbeumo, who was also linked with Newcastle, made it clear to Brentford's hierarchy long before United reached a breakthrough in negotiations that his preferred destination this summer was Old Trafford. Sesko, too, set his sights on a move to M16.",
      "Having failed to qualify for any form of European football this season, concerns were raised about whether United would find it difficult to attract players who would not look out of place in the Champions League. However, just as head coach Ruben Amorim stated back in April, United will always appeal to players.",
      "He said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club.",
      "\"I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea.",
      "\"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "In Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko, United have recruited three players who scored 58 goals between them last season. They could have quite easily ended up at clubs who could have offered them Champions League football this term.",
      "Instead, they wanted to move to Old Trafford, attracted to the size and the scale of one of the world's biggest clubs. United will now be hoping Brighton & Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba subscribes to the same thinking.",
      "United remain keen to strengthen their midfield options ahead of the window closing and Baleba is on their radar. He is one of European football's most highly-rated midfielders and his ceiling is sky-high.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko, he would not look out of place in a team playing Champions League football this season. He can do a little bit of everything in midfield and his skillset is very attractive.",
      "With United's midfield in desperate need of fresh blood, the club's hierarchy will be hoping Baleba is the latest player to prove Amorim right and be attracted to the prospect of representing the Reds.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The defender joined United in 1987 as Fergie's first addition - alphabetically as Brian McClair arrived at the same time - and has first hand experience of what it's like to be part of a Reds rebuild, and how it feels to be cast aside with his United career lasting just four years and appearances hard to come by in the latter two.",
      "United could field a new look attack of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, and Anderson hopes the trio can adapt quickly to the pressures of playing at Old Trafford.",
      "\"Until you walk in the door you don't realise how difficult it can be for players,\" he said. \"Good players going to Manchester United doesn't always apply.",
      "\"Hopefully the new signings will hit the ground running but it is never that easy because of the expectations, the 70,000 fans and what has gone before you.",
      "\"The best way to adapt is by winning matches and getting off to a good start.",
      "\"You have to do the basics that got you there in the first place and the things the manager saw in you in the first place.\"",
      "That manager is now entering his first full season in charge at United and will be aiming to compete at the top end of the table having suffered a woeful domestic campaign last term, when the Reds finished 15th.",
      "Anderson believes starting well will be crucial for Amorim, given the pressure that will mount if results go awry and the questions that will be asked of a manager who has spent nearly £200million and exiled some big name players this summer.",
      "\"Things get escalated at United because it is such a big club worldwide,\" said Anderson. \"Being Man United manager is a very difficult job with very difficult decisions.",
      "\"You need confidence, if they get off to a good start then they can do well. It is important to start well after a disastrous season last season. They need to be on the front foot against a really good team.",
      "\"Arsenal have strengthened well and so have Manchester United, in fairness. I think it will be an intriguing game.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to your dedicated Manchester United transfers blog on Wednesday, August 13.",
      "Heading into the final few weeks of the summer transfer window, United remain active and open to pursuing new opportunities. One of the latest names linked is Carlos Baleba of Brighton & Hove Albion.",
      "The young midfielder is considered one of the most highly rated prospects in European football, with a sky-high ceiling. So far, the club have added Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko to their ranks.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side wrapped up their pre-season campaign over the weekend with a 1-1 draw against Fiorentina at Old Trafford, going on to win the match in a penalty shootout. Now, the focus shifts to the start of the Premier League season and Sunday afternoon's clash with Arsenal.",
      "However, despite the significant investment in three high-profile attacking signings, further business could still be on the cards - provided United are able to sanction one or two departures. As for potential outgoings, Tyrell Malacia, Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Alejandro Garnacho are all effectively available for transfer.",
      "Catch up with the latest news, views and Manchester United transfer rumours below.",
      "Real Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing Man United winger Antony before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Antony is expected to leave the club ahead of the window closing on September 1. Betis have maintained interest in the Brazilian throughout the summer after signing him on loan back in January for the second half of the 2024/25 campaign. He excelled in Spain, scoring nine goals and registering five assists in just 26 games.",
      "\"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo, as quoted by AS. \"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here.",
      "\"If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "United need to sell the Brazilian for £32.58million this summer to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR). He has two years left on his deal at Old Trafford.",
      "Hull City are reportedly hopeful of securing a season-long loan deal for Toby Collyer.",
      "According to our colleagues at Hull Live, Hull view Toby Collyer as a player with significant potential and see him as a strong candidate for the number six role.",
      "The Tigers are believed to have been in talks with Man United for several weeks and are confident they’re leading the race to sign the 21-year-old, ahead of other Championship sides - including Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday.",
      "They are said to be 'quietly confident' of completing a deal for Collyer ahead of Oxford United's visit to the MKM Stadium on Sunday, although the move is not yet finalised. The club is also still awaiting the outcome of their appeal against a three-window fee restriction ban.",
      "Sancho has turned down a transfer offer to leave Man United.",
      "The winger, who has reportedly held talks with several Serie A clubs, is said to have received another offer this week from Turkish side Besiktas.",
      "Besiktas president Serdal Adali said: \"Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too. What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Turkey. We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here.",
      "\"Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.\"",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano reports that Sancho has rejected the chance to reunite with former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in Turkey.",
      "The 25-year-old is believed to be holding out for a move to Italy and has therefore turned down Besiktas’ advances. That stance, however, could change if he is still searching for a new club as the transfer deadline approaches.",
      "Man United have reportedly held talks to sign Dominic Calvert-Lewin following the expiration of his contract at Everton at the end of June.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Calvert-Lewin has parted ways with his agent as he continues his search for a new club, and he has signaled openness to a potential move to United.",
      "In addition to discussions with the Reds, Newcastle United and Leeds United are also said to have engaged in talks regarding a possible transfer. Meanwhile, Sunderland recently made an ambitious attempt to secure the English striker's signature.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, contact with Brighton for the midfielder has continued from Manchester United's side.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel last night, he said: \"Contacts continue for Carlos Baleba. Today, Man United spoke again to the agents of the player. They are prepared to try to understand how much Brighton want.",
      "\"So this week, I expect Manchester United to try to understand the situation directly with Brighton, and let’s see what’s going to happen there. But Baleba remains a topic at United. They are still not moving on another midfielder, and it means that United maintain the contacts active for Baleba and also try to understand if they can really make it happen or if it’s going to be impossible because Brighton still have no intention to reduce their price tag.\"",
      "Give Me Sport report that Man United are keeping an eye on England international, Kane.",
      "The 32-year-old, who joined Bayern Munich from Tottenham Hotspur in 2023, has a release clause in his contract which will come into play in January 2026 and could see him leave the Bundesliga champions for as little as £56million.",
      "Manchester City have reportedly agreed personal terms with Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma over a move to the Etihad.",
      "The 26-year-old Italy international has been linked with a move to the Premier League after he was deemed surplus to requirements at the Parc des Princes under Luis Enrique. United were one of the Premier League clubs most frequently linked with a move for Donnarumma, though it seems that bitter rivals City are now looking to strike a move for the shot-stopper.",
      "French publication L'Equipe claims that Donnarumma had been in talks with both United and City but it is the latter who have reached an agreement on personal terms with the former AC Milan prodigy.",
      "We'll be keeping you updated throughout the day with the latest United news, as there are now less than three weeks until the summer transfer window closes. The countdown is also on for the Reds' Premier League opener against Arsenal!",
      "So, grab yourself a brew - let's get started, shall we?",
      "Join us tomorrow for all the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours.",
      "See you then!",
      "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United this summer, has issued a statement on his future after being left out of Luis Enrique’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "The Italy international has one year remaining on his contract at the Parc des Princes and has been tipped to leave the club this summer.",
      "Donnarumma’s future in the French capital appears untenable, and his recent statement reads like a farewell to the club and its supporters, strongly suggesting that the decision to leave may not have been his own.",
      "Read what he had to say here.",
      "Manchester United remain confident of selling Rasmus Hojlund before the summer transfer window closes, writes James Quinlan.",
      "A hint to what life could be like at Old Trafford for Hojlund following those three signings came last Saturday too, when he was an unused substitute in 1-1 friendly draw with Fiorentina.",
      "The club have already judged around £30m to be a fair market value for a striker who last season scored only four Premier League goals in 32 outings.",
      "However, the CIES Football Observatory has freshly updated its estimated transfer values and would suggest United are severely underestimating themselves and their Danish international.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "David de Gea had a heartwarming interaction with Bruno Fernandes' children after Manchester United's pre-season friendly against Fiorentina over the weekend, writes Keifer MacDonald.",
      "The Reds drew 1-1 with the Serie A outfit at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon after Simon Sohm's eighth-minute opener was cancelled out by a Robin Gosens own-goal.",
      "For De Gea, it was his first return to Old Trafford since he left United at the end of his contract in May 2023. The Spaniard spent 12 seasons with the Red Devils, making 545 appearances.",
      "Read the story here.",
      "Manchester United are not actively pursuing Paris Saint-Germain outcast Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "The goalkeeper has one year remaining on his deal at the Parc des Princes and could depart for a reduced fee this summer. He has not been included in Luis Enrique's squad for their UEFA Super Cup meeting with Tottenham on Wednesday night amid ongoing speculation over his future.",
      "The Italian has been linked with a switch to the Premier League, although the Daily Mail claim United have shut down any suggestions he is a target for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "Donnarumma is not a target and goalkeeper is not a priority position for the club this summer.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Toby Collyer is in talks over a loan move to Championship side Hull City, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "The article claims initial talks have been held over a season-long loan for the 21-year-old, with the Tigers having a strong track record of devloping young talent.",
      "It has been suggested talks are at an early stage and there remains some competition from Sheffield Wednesday, but the midfielder is open to a loan switch ahead of the new campaign.",
      "Garnacho joining Chelsea on a permanent deal could help Man United fund a swoop for Baleba and, also, hand the midfielder a dream welcome gift.",
      "Baleba appears to be open to an Old Trafford switch, but it seems very likely available (or unavailable) finances will be what prevents a would-be deal. Elsewhere, United are said to want £50million to sell Garnacho, but Chelsea are not currently keen on hitting that figure.",
      "If a compromise is reached on a fee, it seems almost guaranteed that United will put those funds towards signing Baleba. If that scenario does play out, United's latest arrival could be left the perfect welcome gift by the departing Garnacho. That is because both players wore the No.17 shirt last season and Garnacho moving on would leave that free for Baleba to take.",
      "As potential alternatives, Baleba has also worn No.20 and No.35 but - after a few alterations - only the former is available at United. It certainly seems as though the No.17 would be his first-choice considering he changed to that squad number at the start of his second season at Brighton.",
      "Man United have made an unusual Rasmus Hojlund decision after launching their new third kit for the upcoming Premier League season.",
      "The smart design is likely to go down a treat with supporters as the predominantly black kit includes a yellow and blue trim. The Adidas strip was unveiled to the general public on Tuesday morning and while there was not anything overtly unusual about the launch, the Dane's involvement may raise eyebrows.",
      "MEN Sport reported this week that the striker was now open to the possibility of signing for AC Milan.",
      "Throughout the summer, Hojlund had insisted that he saw his future at Old Trafford and was not interested in looking at other challenges. However, following the arrival of Benjamin Sesko last week, that mindset has now changed.",
      "Exactly whether the deal will be permanent or on loan is unclear. If United were to allow Hojlund to leave permanently, they would be looking for a price tag in the region of £30m.",
      "Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek has closely followed Sesko’s progress over the past four years and knows exactly what the striker brings to Man United.",
      "\"From time to time, I have to stop him a bit and calm him down: it's just the amazing energy [that he has],\" Kek told Italian reporters ahead of Euro 2024.",
      "\"He is like a magnet, and such a positive one. It is clear that his likeability and splendid public appearances are making it known to little boys and girls that there is a lot of work, training, and sacrifices behind this [success]. He is the modern striker par excellence. I don't know where he will play next season, he will decide but, for now, I'll enjoy him this summer.",
      "\"We're talking about a physically strong centre-forward who has made great progress, also technically, month after month. He came to [the national team] when he was just a lad: a 17-year-old boy, and since then I have been watching him grow into a man. He has become a very important part of the team.",
      "\"Despite his youthfulness, he carries a sort of energy - the character of a diligent boy who would train day and night to achieve his goal.\"",
      "Manchester United were one of three clubs to make an approach for Fiorentina centre-back Comuzzo, according to Tutto Sport.",
      "The report claims that several sides have expressed interest in the young defender in recent weeks, with Bournemouth and Southampton also making moves.",
      "Fiorentina owner and president Rocco Benito Commisso is said to be a strong admirer of Comuzzo and has rejected all three approaches. The club remain firmly opposed to selling, with Commisso convinced the youngster has a very bright future.",
      "According to a report from La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter Milan aim to capitalize on the ongoing fallout between Jadon Sancho and Manchester United in a bid to sign him this summer.",
      "Inter, having decided to sign a forward this month, have added Sancho, Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, and Ademola Lookman to their target list. However, with Lookman reportedly commanding a hefty price, ‘all eyes’ are now on Sancho this summer.",
      "Speaking to reports, Real Betis' sporting director Manu Fajardo has expressed his desire to sign Antony this summer.",
      "He explained:",
      "The desire on both sides, player and club, is to be together again. Every day that passes, the hope grows, but if Antony arrives, it's because he's doing so in the numbers that suit Betis.",
      "Antony requested to leave United at the start of the summer.",
      "Hurzeler maintains he has no 'fear' of losing key players, even with Baleba the latest high-profile name linked to a potential departure.",
      "\"No chance. I don’t feel fear,\" Hurzeler told the BBC. \"I’m not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, work as hard as we can.",
      "\"All the other things we can’t influence, so we really have to focus on us. For sure, we can’t spend the money like the big teams, but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I’m sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "Hurzeler continued: \"It’s not easy, but we proved last season that we are a very competitive team. Without Joao Pedro, for sure, he was an unbelievable player. But we can’t replace him with one player, we can replace him as a team. And that’s our focus.\"",
      "Former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi has questioned Hojlund's hesitation to leave Man United despite interest from AC Milan.",
      "\"We’re not talking about van Basten, nor are we talking about one of the strongest centre-forwards in Europe at the moment. He’s a decent player, nothing more,\" Sacchi told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"I understand the desire of the Rossoneri directors given that there is a shortage of strikers.",
      "\"But it has to be one that wants to come to Italy, one that doesn’t throw a tantrum. I don’t understand his choice. If Milan calls you, you pack your bags and get on the first plane to Malpensa. Milan, in the world of football, is a mystical name. I, along with all the players who are brought in, would take a tour of the trophy room so that we understand where we have come.",
      "\"Of course, Manchester United is also a legendary team. But on the one hand, there is a club, Milan, which is offering you a permanent job, and on the other hand, there is a club that is doing everything to try and sell you. What would you choose?’",
      "According to The Athletic, United's squad are beginning to rally around to try and help the Reds sign Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "It is claimed that unnamed players have contacted the midfielder to explain the set-up at United.",
      "Onana and Mbeumo both represent Cameroon with Baleba while the midfielder knows Leny Yoro from their time together at Lille.",
      "Despite Brighton's stance that Baleba is not for sale this summer, their manager Fabian Hurzeler has insisted that he is not fearful of losing their better players in the transfer window.",
      "Brighton have already lost the likes of Joao Pedro in this window.",
      "He told the Monday Night Club:",
      "We as a club always find solutions and I'm sure in the future we will find solutions. That's our model, we have to accept it. I think that as a club we have proved we are not only selling big players. We have had offers for other players - big offers for [Kaoru] Mitoma and other players. We proved that we are not selling every player. Of course there were some big players who left the club, but there are new players that are coming into the club. With the togetherness we have, with the team chemistry we have, we can compete with the big teams, and we can compete with teams who might be individually better than us.",
      "So much focus has been on attacking quarters this summer that very few names have done the rounds in other positions. Although the Bayern Munich man is a fine player in his own right, surely United are stocked-up at the back? One to keep an eye on, even if it seems fanciful at this stage;",
      "So there we have it. Benjamin Sesko is expected to wear No.30 for United this season. Diego Leon has seemingly shifted to No.35 - despite only just taking No.30 himself - in a late U-turn from the decision-makers. Perhaps it was part of a deal for Sesko? Here are the numbers still available for further signings before the September 1 cut-off;",
      "No.14 / No.20 / No.27 / No.28 / No.29",
      "Barcelona ace Robert Lewandowski has admitted that he previously gave the green light to United.",
      "This happened in 2012 while the striker was still at Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He would later sign for Bayern Munich in 2014.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea are not interested in signing Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer.",
      "It is believed, despite them being linked with the Italian, that Chelsea are happy with the current goalkeepers on their books.",
      "United have also been linked with a move for Donnarumma this summer and Chelsea's stance comes after PSG left the goalkeeper out of their squad for the Super Cup on Wednesday.",
      "Despite knowing that there is clear interest from United in Baleba, Brighton are reportedly relaxed about the situation.",
      "That is according to journalist Florian Plettenberg, with the Seagulls thought to be against the idea of selling the midfielder this summer.",
      "Plettenberg's report adds that United have continued talks with Baleba's agent over the costs involved in a deal.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United transfer blog this morning.",
      "My name is Jack Flintham and I shall be taking you through until 2pm with all the latest United news, views and transfer rumours.",

      "Baleba has recently been identified as a target to reinforce United's midfield this summer. At just 21 years of age, the Cameroonian, who moved to Brighton from Lille two years ago, has already established himself as one of the Premier League’s most highly-rated central players.",
      "The youngster is a versatile midfielder capable of contributing across the pitch and on paper at least, appears to be exactly the type of player Ruben Amorim’s team need.",
      "Baleba is about to embark on just his third season in the Premier League but his ambitions are clear - and United may feel they can help him achieve them.",
      "When asked if that was achievable on the south coast, the midfielder added: \"For me, there are opportunities everywhere. I can win trophies here with Brighton, I can win trophies at another club.",
      "\"My ambition is to just win trophies everywhere I go. Just doing that and making the world happy.\"",
      "On Tuesday, journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that talks with Brighton are ongoing as United try to understand the Seagulls' asking price. He added that they are not pursuing other targets as things stand, even though Brighton reportedly have 'no intention' of lowering their asking price of over £100million.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler says he has 'no fear' about the speculation surrounding Baleba’s future.",
      "\"No chance. I don't feel fear,\" he stated. \"I'm not afraid of anything because the only thing we can do is be the best version we can be every day, like work as hard as we can. All the other things we can't influence, so we really have to focus on us.",
      "\"For sure, we can't spend the money like the big teams but one of our biggest values is togetherness. And if you stay together, if we try to push our limits and increase the boundaries, then I'm sure we can compete with the big teams.\"",
      "But with Baleba's huge reported price tag, United may need to make some sales before looking at tying up a transfer. Baleba has featured in 61 top-flight matches in England over the past two seasons.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "With Benjamin Sesko signed, Manchester United can finally switch their focus to other areas of the squad in need of investment.",
      "The Slovenia international finalised his £66.4million move to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig on Saturday, becoming United's fourth signing of the summer and their third in the attacking department.",
      "Despite signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo earlier this summer, the addition of an out-and-out centre-forward remained United's leading priority ahead of the September 1 transfer deadline.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference, meaning they were left with no choice but to prioritise attacking signings this summer. Between them, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko scored 58 goals for their former clubs last season.",
      "In Cunha and Mbeumo, United have sourced two players with impressive Premier League records. They have scored 71 career goals in the division between them, plundering 35 of them last season.",
      "Sesko, of course, has arrived from overseas, meaning there is more of a risk attached, but he should benefit from operating alongside two players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United have often turned to the overseas market for new additions in recent years, regularly taking one too many gambles. The additions of Rasmus Hojlund and Antony, for example, rank as two of the worst signings in United's history when you consider their price tags.",
      "No transfer is guaranteed to be a success at any level of the game, but there is a lot less risk attached when recruiting a player that knows the league.",
      "Having not seen the best version of Manuel Ugarte all that often in the last 12 months, United are hoping to add a midfielder to their ranks before the window closes. Brighton ace Carlos Baleba has emerged as a target and he would be a terrific signing for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Despite only being 21, the Cameroonian, who joined Brighton from Lille two years ago, has become one of the Premier League's most highly-rated midfielders. The latest hidden talent to be discovered by the Seagulls, Baleba is capable of doing a little bit of everything in midfield.",
      "Renowned for his energy, his ball-carrying expertise, his passing range and his hunger to win the ball back, he ticks a lot of boxes for United. The Reds currently lack a midfielder that can do a little bit of everything in the engine room.",
      "Ugarte was drafted in last summer to provide some defensive nous and bite, but it has become clear he is limited when in possession. He struggles to progress the ball in the way United need him to.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is an excellent operator with enormous amounts of potential, but his long-term position under Amorim is yet to be nailed down. Furthermore, he is a forward-thinking player and lacks the defensive ability to play next to Bruno Fernandes in a midfield duo.",
      "Casemiro is past his best and struggled last season to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League, reserving his best performances for the Europa League. He also has less than a year remaining on his contract and should be sold if a new midfielder arrives.",
      "Baleba, on the other hand, is up and coming. He has demonstrated he has what it takes to consistently make his mark in the Premier League and United do lack a midfielder of his profile.",
      "Of course, it has been well-documented Baleba will not come cheap, but United are well aware of that. Brighton will dig their heels in to try and secure as high a fee as possible.",
      "Despite only being 21, Baleba has only played 21 Premier League games fewer than Cunha, racking up 61 top flight appearances in England over the last two seasons.",
      "United often turned to the Premier League's best talent during Sir Alex Ferguson's heyday. After signing Cunha and Mbeumo from domestic rivals already this summer, United would be wise to do the same again to solve their next transfer objective.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "An unnamed Manchester United player has already had a \"b********g\" from Tom Heaton.",
      "\"Yes, but only naturally,\" Heaton laughed. \"It's not just about delivering sort of b********gs as you put it. I think it's also about supporting people that need it, trying to make sure we're guiding it and channelling it in the right way.\"",
      "Heaton, Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire are the three players part of the old United leadership group who are in the new one, revived by Ruben Amorim. Heaton, 40 next year, signed a one-year deal with United in June and remains one of the most prominent voices in the dressing room.",
      "The newest members are Diogo Dalot, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui. It is a diverse blend of three 30-somethings and three players in their twenties, with four countries and three continents represented. The average age is just over 30.",
      "\"They are responsible for the group,\" Amorim explained. \"There are some things that in the last year I had to deal with. I said to them this year, you deal with that. Small issues are with you guys. You are responsible. All these small changes, I think it's helping the group.\"",
      "Heaton has a 14-year association with United through two separate stints and rejoined his boyhood club in 2021. \"I think he (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room,\" Heaton explained, \"it provides a little bit of support to Bruno in that respect. That's how it came about and obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and try and have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Dalot is the second-longest serving member of the United squad after Luke Shaw, into his 12th year at the club. Shaw was a member of the octet established by Erik ten Hag but started four games last season, three of them in May.",
      "The MEN revealed last season Amorim gravitated towards Dalot and Fernandes. A natural development, given their shared nationality. Dalot is also fluent in four languages, which makes him one of the most approachable members of the squad.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo mentioned Dalot and Martinez among three teammates he admired at United in 2022. Casemiro, the third, was also added to the original leadership group by Ten Hag.",
      "In 2024, Dalot emulated Ronaldo by becoming the United players' player of the year. A senior statesman of the squad, a polyglot, rarely injured and affable, it was easy to see why he got most teammates' vote.",
      "Dalot had his squad number upgraded to '2' by Amorim in the summer and he captained United in the second half of their goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm last month. The irony is he is no longer a certain starter, with Amad the favoured option on the right wing to collaborate with Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Only one of the leadership group could feasibly start against Arsenal on Sunday - Fernandes. It is unlikely to cow the others in the dressing room.",
      "\"It obviously brings you even more responsibility,\" Dalot accepts, \"but I think one of the reasons why that happened is because of the way I am.",
      "\"So I try to be the same person, but obviously it brings you even more responsibility because we're talking about a very good group of players with different personalities that I think we can try to create a culture where we demand the maximum from our teammates, from ourselves as well.",
      "\"But we have to be the first ones to give the example. I think that's the best way that I like to lead also. We have to be the first ones to show to everyone where we want to put the club back on top and then try to put everyone in the same. Like we say in Portugal, everyone is in the same boat.\"",
      "Dalot is close to Ronaldo and had Raphael Varane and Casemiro within earshot during United's successful 2022-23 season, three serial winners to look up to. His fitness is so renowned he has missed only 13 club games since he returned to United from a season-long loan at AC Milan in 2021.",
      "A source said Dalot \"took every good trait when playing with Cristiano and only further enhanced his dedication\". Dalot wears leg compressors on long-haul flights to reduce any muscle soreness and maximise circulation.",
      "Sources have pointed out how much leaner and chiselled Dalot now looks in contrast to his unveiling pictures in June 2018. Dalot, 19 at the time, was recovering from a meniscus injury that kept him sidelined for three months but he had a cherub face. Now he employs a private chef to prepare his meals at home.",
      "Fernandes has only ever missed two United games through injury in five-and-a-half years. \"He has the highest pain threshold I have ever encountered,\" a Carrington source said.",
      "His influence remains profound. As recently as the 1-1 draw with Fiorentina on Saturday, Fernandes urged Patrick Dorgu to show more intensity in the 78th minute. A minute later, Dorgu was sprinting into the penalty area.",
      "Amorim included Mazraoui - signed by Ten Hag - as \"he's a character that I like\". Mazraoui played in seven different positions last season and was rested for only two games.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee enthused about how motivational a presence Martinez, sidelined since February 2 with a knee injury, has been in the treatment room. Martinez captained United in the 1-1 Europa League draw with Fenerbahce last year.",
      "Maguire, stripped of the captaincy by Ten Hag in July 2023, pulled the armband back on for the first time under Amorim during the 4-0 thrashing of Everton on December 1. Maguire's form over the past two seasons, having seen a £30million transfer to West Ham United collapse, is testament to his resolve. He is now one of a handful of respectable signings in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "United opened the doors to their renovated Carrington hub on Friday. Heaton, a veteran of training days at Lyttleton Road and The Cliff as a schoolboy, described the launch as \"a moment in the club. Especially for us as players, we're in it all the time. So I think we can use that to go again and build and move it forward and making sure that all the lads are aligned with that.\"",
      "Dalot is not as demonstrative as his compatriot Fernandes but is emboldened to pull players in line. \"Of course, otherwise we couldn't be in that group,\" he said. \"I think the decision was clear because obviously we're talking about six players with different personalities, but at the same time we need to start demanding more from each other, create this culture where when things are not going in the right direction, we have to be assertive and put it right.",
      "\"I think that's the only way to go to where we want to go.\"",
      "Expect a few more b********gs.",

      "If Ruben Amorim's starting XI against Fiorentina on Saturday confirmed anything, it was that Rasmus Hojlund will not be starting Sunday's Premier League opener against Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "The Dane was left out of the starting line-up for the second game running, with Amorim choosing to deploy Mason Mount up front instead.",
      "Whether Hojlund departs or not, Sesko is expected to be thrown straight into the starting XI this weekend and lead United's attack. He should be supported by fellow new recruits Bryan Mbeumo and Cunha, who occupied the two playmaker roles at the weekend.",
      "Following the penalty shootout triumph over Fiorentina, Amorim admitted he has an \"idea\" of what his starting XI will look like for the Premier League curtain-raiser against the Gunners. However, he did concede that his players could still alter his plans.",
      "When asked about having a selection headache, Amorim told MUTV: \"That is a good thing, it's supposed to be like that, not like last season when we had to struggle to put 11 players on the pitch.",
      "\"This is a normal thing, so I have to think and they need to fight during the week so they can change my mind. I have one idea, but they can change my mind during the week.\"",
      "With five days to go until the clash with Arsenal, United fans are beginning to share predictions and their opinions on what the starting XI should look like. Many of their predicted XIs have similar looks and it is unlikely their submissions will be far from the XI that is revealed at 3.15pm on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Factoring in how pre-season unfolded and how the landscape of the squad currently looks, it can be argued that eight starters are guaranteed: Andre Onana (expected to be back fit), Leny Yoro, Amad, Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu, Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko.",
      "However, there is a debate to be had about who will start in the centre and on the left of the defence and alongside Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven started against Fiorentina and Casemiro got the nod in the engine room next to Fernandes. The latter's performance reminded United of why they are still in need of a midfielder.",
      "Yoro is the only centre-back guaranteed to start against the Gunners after making four starts in a row in pre-season and producing some really promising performances, particularly in the United States. De Ligt bagged three starts, likewise Luke Shaw, but Maguire and Heaven only started twice.",
      "Maguire and De Ligt are competing to start in the middle of the defence and that battle was always likely to be decided by pre-season performances. Heaven has made rapid progress since joining United and is an exciting option for the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw is also in the conversation to start.",
      "The other selection dilemma facing Amorim is who should start in midfield next to Fernandes. Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro are competing for that spot and the latter earned three starts in pre-season.",
      "However, he showed last season he struggles to keep up with the pace of the play in the Premier League. Ugarte is a solid midfield destroyer, capable of winning the ball back, but he is limited in possession.",
      "Mainoo has talent Amorim needs to tap into, but the prospect of him and Fernandes starting next to each other in midfield risks leaving United exposed in the centre of the pitch.",
      "With eight starters looking nailed on, three places remain up for grabs.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The shirt is predominantly black with a yellow and blue trim. The trim features around the collar, on the shoulders and on the sleeve cuffs.",
      "It is inspired by the famous away kit worn by United between 1993 and 1995, including when the club won the Double for the first time in 1993/94.",
      "The Snapdragon logo, just as it is on the home and away shirts that were revealed earlier this summer, is again front and centre on the shirt. Qualcomm Technologies has a £60million a season sponsorship deal with the club and had their brand Snapdragon on the front of shirts for the first time last term.",
      "The shirt also features adidas' iconic Trefoil logo in yellow and the United crest is positioned inside a shield.",
      "Reimagining one of the most storied kits in the club's history, the design focuses on the details, from the engineered devil-base fabric to the authentic three-stripe tape and flat-knit crew collar and cuffs.After last season's celebrated reintroduction of the adidas Trefoil logo on their third shirt, United have said 'its return honours the logo's historic legacy in the sport, as well as acknowledging the rising role of fashion in today's game'.",
      "United's players donned the new away kit in their opening two pre-season friendlies of the summer before wearing their new home strip for the win over Bournemouth and the draws against Everton and Fiorentina.",

      "United have made three new signings so far this summer, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all joining, while Diego Leon has arrived after a deal was struck in January. There is the potential for more new signings to come, though, with two players in particular being heavily linked with moves to United.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba and Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma have both been linked with signing for United this summer. Baleba is reported to be valued at around £100million by the Seagulls, while Donnarumma is expected to leave PSG either this summer for a fee or next summer as a free agent when his contract expires.",
      "If United were to somehow sign both players, each of the duo would be expected to go straight into the first-choice starting line-up. Donnarumma would compete with Andre Onana for the starting spot, and could lead to speculation about the United No.24's future. Donnarumma's arrival would also lead to rumours about Altay Bayindir's future at Old Trafford.",
      "When it comes to the midfield, Baleba could take on a role in a double pivot alongside club captain Bruno Fernandes in the middle of the park. United would also have Casemiro, Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte who could perform in the role alongside Baleba.",
      "The forward line is likely to be made up of all three new signings with Mebumo and Cunha on the wings and Sesko through the middle as the centre forward. Amad's versatility could allow him to be an option as a winger as well as a wing-back, while Joshua Zirkzee could provide competition as a striker. The same could also be said for Rasmus Hojlund, unless the forward goes on to leave Old Trafford amid speculation of a potential move to AC Milan.",

      "Ugarte arrived on deadline day and did not make his debut until the other side of the September international break.",
      "The season was already more than a month old by the time he eventually made his first Premier League start, alongside Kobbie Mainoo for the 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on September 30.",
      "Although there is still an obvious need for United to sign a midfielder again this summer, strengthening that particular area of the pitch was not their main priority when the window opened on June 1. Instead, they prioritised the signing of a striker.",
      "After getting both Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the door in time for the pre-season tour of the United States, United added another attacker to their ranks on Saturday, landing the centre-forward they desperately needed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has arrived from RB Leipzig for an initial fee of £66.4million and has completed United's attacking rebuild. Signing a five-year-deal, the 22-year-old has moved to Old Trafford on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany last term.",
      "To have added Sesko to the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha ahead of the start of the season is a massive boost for United and Amorim, who must be feeling incredibly tempted to unleash his three new attackers as a trio for the first time against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, seeing Viktor Gyokeres go to Arsenal and running the rule over Ollie Watkins only to see Aston Villa make it crystal clear he was not for sale, there was a risk United's striker search could have still been ongoing in the closing stages of the window.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",

      "Sesko was not their first-choice option but they have landed themselves one of Europe's most highly-rated strikers, whose name has been linked with several big-name clubs over the last few years.",
      "In securing his signature, United have ensured their biggest objective on their to-do list has been ticked ahead of a ball being kicked. That is a massive positive just in itself.",

      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has been left out of Paris Saint-Germain's travelling squad for the UEFA Super Cup amid links to Manchester United.",
      "The Champions League winners will take on Tottenham in Italy on Wednesday, following their Europa League final victory over United. Donnarumma's contract in the French capital expires at the end of next season, leaving him free to depart without a transfer fee.",
      "Despite not finding an agreement over a new deal, it's thought that Donnarumma was left 'disappointed' over Luis Enrique's decision to leave him out of the squad. According to Fabrizio Romano, the goalkeeper is 'set to clarify' his position with the club.",
      "Romano adds that the 26-year-old will '100 per cent' leave the French champions.",
      "United have been linked with his services, and according to reports, the Italian is open to the idea of moving to Old Trafford. Donnarumma has entered the final year of his contract and will likely be available for a cut-price fee.",
      "After United’s win over Fiorentina, a supporter approached Amorim outside Old Trafford and asked: \"Hey Ruben, who are we signing? Are we getting Donnarumma?\"",
      "Amorim replied: \"Sorry?\" before the fan repeated the question about the Italian. As he signed autographs, the United boss chuckled but gave no answer.",

      "Manchester United have released an ‘iconic’ piece of footwear to mark the launch of their new third kit. On Tuesday, the club launched the Manchester United adidas Originals Gazelle Trainers.",
      "They have been designed to match the new 2025/26 third kit, coming in utility black suede and adidas’ classic three stripes in preloved yellow. They also feature the club crest on the heel and ‘MANCHESTER UNITED’ in gold-foil text on the outer edge.",
      "Adidas said it created the ‘iconic’ shoes ‘for loyal Manchester United fans’, saying: “These adidas Gazelle shoes will keep you comfortable whether you’re headed to the game or kicking back at home. Manchester United’s third kit colours and crest show who you follow.”",
      "The Manchester United adidas Originals Gazelle are available from Fanatics and JD Sports for £100. It comes as the club launched its 2025/26 third kit ahead of the new season, which is said to be a ‘bold reimagining rooted in 90s nostalgia’.",
      "It is inspired by the black away kit worn between 1993 and 1995, including when the club won the Double for the first time in 1993/94. The black base fabric features a subtle club devil motif woven directly into the design, alongside a black-and-yellow shield crest with yellow-and-blue accents on the collar and cuffs.",
      "Manchester United fans can pick up the new adidas Gazelle trainers at Fanatics.",
      "The third shirt is finished with three adidas stripes in bold yellow across the shoulders and the Trefoil logo in yellow on the chest. Man United’s first game of the new campaign comes on August 17 as they host Arsenal at Old Trafford, but the club have not confirmed when they will wear the third kit for the first time.",
      "Following the launch, Man United fans flocked to social media to share their reactions, with some hailing it as ‘the best jersey in decades’. Writing on X, one said: “This is the best jersey in decades, and needs King Cantona wearing it.”",
      "Another said: “Best retro we’ve done in a while this.” Not everyone is sold though, as this fan commented: “Ah yes, nothing screams Mancunian pride like a shirt that’ll be outdated in 10 months.”",
      "While another impressed fan wrote: “I don’t know the last time the United third jersey looked this good.”",

      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown believes Benjamin Sesko will benefit from the presence of fellow summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha this season.",
      "United completed their attacking overhaul with the addition of the Slovenian international from RB Leipzig on Saturday. He has joined the club for an initial fee of £66.4million, signing a five-year deal.",
      "Sesko has arrived at Old Trafford on the back of a 21-goal season for Leipzig last season, meaning he will have ambitions of producing a similar return in his debut season in England. However, some doubts have been raised about United's decision to recruit a second young striker from abroad in three years.",
      "However, Brown, speaking to William Hill, admitted he is optimistic Sesko will be able to deliver the goods in the Premier League, pointing to the attacking quality he will have around him.",
      "\"With those two [Cunha and Mbeumo], United have added two creative players, two very-attack minded players,\" Brown said, speaking on behalf of UK casinos. \"In the team, supporting him, that will really help.",
      "\"But I do think Sesko, in his own right, has had to sort of do that himself over the last two years. I know for a fact that clubs have been looking at him, and I think it is the right time that he went to a really, really big club.",
      "\"That is no disrespect to Leipzig, but he obviously wants to show what he can do on a bigger stage and I think now is the right time.",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is still there and he is the guy that did a lot last season. Amad will probably start at wing-back on the right-hand side and I think United have got a lot of players, that if they did get injuries, can come straight in and stick to the same routine.",
      "\"But United have these three individuals [Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko] that, respectfully for their own teams, have done really well over the last couple of years.\"",
      "With just under three weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, United have brought in four few faces so far, spending the best part of £200m. Sesko has become the latest headline addition and Brown says the Reds have done a great job in the market thus far",
      "The former United defender added: \"It has been very positive. I think the players they have brought in have been excellent, to be honest.",
      "\"You get Cunha who is a presence and was probably the best attacking player in his team. He has got a bit about himself as well that United have missed over the years a little bit.",
      "\"Diego Leon is very promising, he looks strong, sharp and he knows his position. Then you get Mbeumo and Sesko and you are like, 'okay, this is good'.",
      "\"For me Mbeumo has been the best player for the last two years in the sense that what he has been able to continue doing through his club at the time. Sesko, I know a lot of teams have been looking at him for a good few years, so he has actually come with a lot of experience now, not just in leagues but in Europe as well.",
      "\"He is a big, tall lad, he knows how to play, he's good with his feet, can score with his head and you do have to say they have done a really good job.\"",

      "Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski has admitted he gave Manchester United the green light to sign him back in 2012.",
      "On the books of German club Borussia Dortmund at the time, Lewandowski was beginning to emerge as one of Europe's best strikers after scoring 30 goals in 47 matches for the Bundesliga side during the 2011/12 campaign.",
      "After missing out on the Premier League title to rivals Manchester City on goal difference in 2011/12, United prioritised the addition of a striker ahead of the 2012/13 campaign.",
      "Robin van Persie, of course, arrived from Arsenal and he scored 30 goals across all competitions, including 26 in the Premier League to ensure United reclaimed their crown and he won the Golden Boot.",
      "However, Lewandowski, who will turn 37 later this month, has revealed he \"said yes\" to United that summer, admitting he wanted to link up with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "\"To Manchester United I decided and said yes,\" Lewandowski told BBC Sport. \"I wanted to join Manchester United, to see Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "However, Dortmund were not prepared to let go of their talisman, meaning he remained at the club until he joined Bayern Munich in July 2014 on a free transfer after signing a pre-contract agreement earlier in the year. His last two seasons at Dortmund saw him plunder 64 goals.",
      "\"They could not sell me,\" Lewandowski added, addressing Dortmund's reluctance to lose him at the time of United's interest. \"Because they knew if I stayed they could earn more money, and that I could wait maybe one or two more years.",
      "\"But it is true that I said yes to Manchester United.\"",
      "Following his time at Dortmund, Lewandowski spent eight years at Bayern before joining Barcelona in 2022. Despite turning 37 next week, he scored a whopping 42 goals for the La Liga champions last term.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",

      "The new season is upon Manchester United and they have three new forwards to pit against Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "Benjamin Sesko's arrival eight days before United's opening Premier League fixture is well timed. United head coach Ruben Amorim trialled Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo up front in United's friendly draws with Fiorentina and Everton.",
      "Sesko arrived in Manchester on Thursday and he has already dined at Spinningfields and San Carlo as he settles into his new home. More importantly, he will have had a full week to familiarise himself with his new teammates at Carrington.",
      "Here are some talking points from Sesko's first training session at United:",
      "United uploaded pictures from their post-Fiorentina training session on Monday but they are dated Sunday August 10. So the session took place the day after the 1-1 draw.",
      "The day after a match is a recovery day for starters. Bruno Fernandes was captured by club photographers but he looks more like a ball-boy than a participant.",
      "Every substitute who came on against Fiorentina (Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot) is accounted for. So are unused substitutes Tom Heaton, Chido Obi, Tyler Fredricson, Toby Collyer, Diego Leon and Dermot Mee.",
      "The only substitute not visible in the imagery is Rasmus Hojlund. That seems somewhat significant amid United's efforts to offload him to AC Milan.",
      "Sesko will have had a full week of training to prepare for the Arsenal match. United players are bullish about the new season partly due to the ample recovery time they will have between matches in the absence of any European football but August is always a sparse month.",
      "The 22-year-old Sesko played 45 minutes for RB Leipzig during their pre-season schedule and that was on July 19, so he is short of minutes. Amorim has ensured the majority of United's core squad members have had sufficient playing time over their five friendlies (Fernandes and Amad were the only two to start all five friendlies) and United looked fitter than they had done in pre-season for several years.",
      "Yet with Hojlund out in the cold, Joshua Zirkzee only just back from injury and no other senior striker, Sesko has to start. A full week at Carrington should stand him in good stead.",
      "Defender Noussair Mazraoui remains an injury concern ahead of United's Premier League opener.",
      "The Morocco international missed United's final four games of pre-season after featuring in the first half of their opening friendly of the summer against Leeds United just over three weeks ago.",
      "Despite travelling to the United States for the club's pre-season tour, he played no part in any of their Premier League Summer Series fixtures and was last pictured training two days before the tour opener against West Ham United in New Jersey.",
      "Since the United squad returned to England early last week, the club has not uploaded any training images or footage of the defender, meaning he could miss out on Sunday.",
      "With plenty of first-team players not taking part in the session, United boosted the numbers by including some academy players. Among those pictured were Jaydan Kamason, Fredricson, Rhys Bennett, Jacob Devaney, Sekou Kone, James Scanlon, Ethan Ennis, Ethan Williams and Bendito Mantato.",
      "Fredricson was the only player from the aforementioned list to be included in the matchday squad against Fiorentina, but he failed to make it off the bench.",
      "Alongside Fredricson, Kone, Williams and Mantato were named in the United squad for their tour of the US.",

      "Liverpool or Man City for the Premier League title, various teams beginning with B to get relegated; we have lots of pre-season predictions.",
      "Send your own to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Pre-season predictions ahoy\nAnd just like that, we’re almost at the dawn of another Premier League season. With this in my mind, I thought I’d share a few thoughts and predictions;",
      "1) There will be a proper title fight – Liverpool look to have spent very well, however we all know that players coming into the Prem from other leagues are not guaranteed to be successful. I also think they look a bit thin at the back, and one serious injury to a first-choice centre back leaves them vulnerable. This said, I’ve just got a feeling Man City are going to be absolutely mint, and Chelsea will not be far behind. Unfortunately for Arsenal, I see them finishing a rather distant 4th, and so ending ‘The Process’.",
      "2) Man United will be very, very good – Amorim clearly has something about him. Yes, he’s hellbent on his system, but every time he speaks, I listen (and no, I’m not “Man Yoo”). You can’t 100% rule out Cunha having a ‘Cantona Moment’ and ending up in the crowd with his studs deep in someone’s neck, however you also can’t rule out him being utterly fabulous. He was just born to be a United player, wasn’t he?",
      "3) Sticking with matters at Old Trafford – Either Vardy or Calvert Lewin will sign on a free, late in the window on a 12-month deal.",
      "4) Glasner will not be Crystal Palace manager at the end of the season – Clearly there are some frustrations with regards to recruitment at The Dogtrack (yes, I still miss you, Ted, Beard and Co.), and Glasner is also in the last year of his contract. A sticky start for Kompany at The Alianz, and it’s next-stop Munich for Olly G.",
      "5) Brentford could be many, many different kinds of f*cked – No explanation necessary, and still wishing you the best of luck, Keith.\nLeeds or Sunderland (or both) to stay up – I genuinely think Farke is a very good coach, and I think Sunlun’ have easily spent the best money of the three promoted teams. Given my previous comment regarding Brentord, and also with a slight worry for Wolves, I don’t think it’s out of the question one of, or even both Leeds and Sunlun’ survive (just). But what of Burnley I hear you ask, well……..",
      "6) Burnley to finish bottom and without Parker – Yes, they were promoted at a canter, but as long as I’ve got a hole up my ar*e, Scott Parker is not a Prem manager.",
      "Of course, now I’ve said all that, Arsenal will win the Prem and CL double, United will finish 15th (again) and Burnley will finish 11th (just above Palace, because…… well, Palace) with Parker wining manager of the Season. Either way, it’s nearly time and I for one, can’t f*cking wait.\nAndy FTM (I know I’ll regret saying this after he gets sent off for the 11th time on Boxing Day, but Granit Xhaka might just be the best £13 mil ever spent)",
      "",
      "…I know no one cares what I think, but I’m bored, so…",
      "Who will win the league? Liverpool repeat, but not by a lot, and said with zero confidence.",
      "Rest of the top 4, in order? Arsenal, Man City, Aston Villa – a boy’s gotta dream.",
      "Three picks for relegation? I just can’t see Burnley and Sunderland staying up. I’m not sure I see Leeds doing so either but one of Brentford or West Ham will give them enough hope. Actually, sorry, Brentford, you’re the third.",
      "Which club will be a pleasant surprise? Bias may come into, but I think Villa are being slept on. Missed out on CL football by goal difference having got to the QF of said competition. Can rotate more and still compete in the EL having not really lost many of the core squad. A pleasantish early fixture run too. I mean, see answer two.",
      "Who will win the Golden Boot? Oh. Hmmm. I may actually have to think about this for once… AFCON, Haaland might start slow, Isak may not start at all… Haaland pips Salah with a strong finish.",
      "Which new signing will have the greatest positive impact? I think that Wirtz fella just be pretty good.",
      "And which one will turn out to be a massive flop? I think Gyokeres and Sesko will do enough. I’ll say Cunha, but with no conviction.",
      "Who will be the biggest bloody bargain? Well, this is anyone’s Guessand?!",
      "Who will be named PFA Player of the Year? I can’t see it being Wirtz in year one and whilst the AFCON absence may affect Salah I’m still going to be sensible and say him.",
      "Who will be the first manager to leave their job? Instinct say Keith Andrews but the Brentford hierarchy is probably too sensible to pull the trigger quickly. Hello Graham Potter!",
      "Pick the Champs League winner? Real Pool. Paris Saint Munich. I don’t bloody know. Balls to it, Liverpool do a nice double.",
      "Finally, in 5 words, tell me what you are most excited about? It seems pretty wide open.",

      "* Oliver Glasner said to Guardiola after their second Premier League meeting that if Manchester City played that way in the FA Cup Final, Palace would win. Clearly, he also had a plan to beat Liverpool and, in something that vindicates one of my opinions if not one many others would share, it involved Virgil van Dijk. A lot of people would understandably force play away from the Best Defender in the World, but that is to buy into the hype instead of seeing with your own eyes.",
      "For the past few seasons, van Dijk has been repeatedly guilty of ball-watching and many of the goals Liverpool concede, particularly against counter-attacking sides, come as a result of this.",
      "For the first goal, van Dijk is supposed to be marking Jean-Philippe Mateta, but leaves him to lunge in at Sarr without getting the ball. There was no need to make that tackle, had he simply held his position in the line Sarr would not have been able to shoot. For the second goal, he is not the only Liverpool player suckered in. When Wharton receives the ball, van Dijk is isolated two on one by Mateta and Sarr, but is actually covering neither of them because he is only looking at the ball. Taking a couple of steps towards Wharton gives the Palace man enough time and space to realise Sarr is completely unmarked. If van Dijk holds his position in the defensive line, there is significantly less chance Palace score.",
      "It says a lot for Alisson really that people don’t realise how frequently this happens, and a significant part of that is because the world’s actual best goalkeeper bails his teammate out so regularly that the mistakes don’t lead to goals.",

I’ve no idea why someone would deliberately interrupt a tribute like that and can’t quite believe it has happened. There’s been very little ill will between Liverpool and Crystal Palace over the years, something underlined by those fan groups encouraging people to support the silence (and by Liverpool and Everton fans singling out Palace for their absence of poverty chants), I don’t know why you’d want to change that.",
      "* Speaking of ill will with Liverpool, we come to Notts “Nottingham” Forest. Again, it’s weird that a club without a history of being rivals with Palace should celebrate defeat at the CAS with the combined glee of winning the European Cup with Brian Clough and seeing Derby County getting relegated. Then again, despite the constant reminders in West Bridgford and beyond, we are a long way removed from that era of Forest. Towards the end of last season they were a bit like a Roy Hodgson team, blessed with some superb attacking talent but not really doing a lot of attacking, and not scoring many goals. How much longer that’s tolerated by their notoriously calm, measured and patient owner remains to be seen.",

It wouldn’t be Chelsea if there wasn’t some sort of squad overhaul ongoing, but the players they do have are more than capable of winning the game.

As it is surely clear to any reasonable, unbiased person, we are not one of the MCO’s that UEFA, in their rules at least, seem to be trying to prevent. The details have been well documented, but expecting Palace to have done something by that deadline when, by their own club’s setup, Textor had no decisive influence seems absurd for a club that was bottom-half and had never won anything or played in Europe before…. who then did their utmost to correct the situation and can now literally have no affect on the integrity of the competition, which surely is the whole point of the MCO rules.",

That said, since the World Class article was published, and through the myriad conversations I’ve had since, I did want to try to figure something out.",

      "It’s not like Ollie “130k a week” Watkins actually cares that Johnny Gatekeeper thinks he’s world class or not when he’s played and performed at pretty much every level while earning more money in a training session than a whole F365 commentariat combined earns in a week, so why do WE think it matters? I’ll admit, I’ve actually had my heart-rate increase this week when discussing some of the wilder takes (probably the cakes, mind but still) but on reflection, I realised the problem was that my definition of world class is about inclusion and so because of that it became personal to me that someone would think Paul Gascoigne wasn’t a world class footballer, not because I care about Gazza, (though I do, god bless him) but because I will never not feel that moments of magic are just as important as rote consistency in our game.",
      "To try to restrict who is world class, who is bargain bin, who is bang average, and who is Lee Cattermole, when definable boundaries are not clear, is to deflect yourself onto the discussion. Those that disclude goalkeepers clearly don’t value what a goalkeeper can do, but also might be fair to say are risk averse individuals… the kind who at 5 a side belts up the pitch, loses the ball then just turns and watches as his 4 mates get torn apart by his failings and shrugs. Those that want 300 players to be World Class are the intelligent ones who… I kid, obviously, but I am aware my desire to be inclusive shows a large part of my lack of standards. The fact I genuinely think the impressive careers of Milner and Barry, great as they were, haven’t left the same cultural impact on football that say, the short careers of Wilshere or Dele did… (now THAT’s a hot take.)",
      "So for my part, while I remain resolute that “my” version of World Class is one that is more inclusive of the deficiencies of football (after all, what IS a perfect footballer?*) and allowing of bad days, I do want to make it clear that I appreciate some don’t like to colour outside the lines, or hear a bum note in a live album, and I am here for it, for it is our differences that make our sport what it is.",

I was a bit surprised to see VVD (and Beckenbauer) in the latter list, but it got me thinking since Matt’s world class list had no defenders. Using his definition of talent evidenced anywhere on the pitch, what defenders were or are world class? Maldini? Baresi? Maybe Rio? But if not Beckenbauer, I think it’s hard to say any of these are world class too.

      "10) Milos Kerkez (Liverpool)\nWe said ages ago that Liverpool needed a left-back. They listened, and here is Milos Kerkez for £40million – a decent price in this inflated market. While Andy Robertson will always be a cult hero and (at least) a two-time Premier League champion, he was a weak link in an otherwise slick Slot machine.",
      "Kerkez is quicker, younger (22 in November), and frankly better. The Hungarian is an upgrade, and crucially, Premier League-proven. He and Jeremie Frimpong are both strong additions, but Kerkez edges it, partly because Frimpong might fall over if you breathe on him too hard.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro (Chelsea)\nThis one shot up the rankings after Pedro tore it up in the Club World Cup. He wouldn’t have made the cut otherwise, but those performances were outrageous. The brace against his boyhood club Fluminense left us in awe, and he didn’t stop there, scoring against PSG in the final as Chelsea smashed the European champions 3-0.",
      "The Blues splashed £55million, which already doesn’t look like too much. They might finally have an elite No.9 that makes Enzo Maresca’s side serious Premier League title contenders.",
      "",
      "8) Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nThis shouldn’t be happening, but it is. Sunderland, fresh off promotion, have convinced Granit Xhaka to swap Champions League football with Bayer Leverkusen for a relegation scrap. And we love it.",
      "For just £13million, they’ve signed a player far too good for the bottom half. Sure, he’s had his critics – many of them loud and correct – but the Swiss international has matured, added composure, and now walks into this team as captain-in-waiting. Sunderland have watched Burnley, Ipswich and others make transfer mistakes and get relegated. They’re doing things a bit differently and we rate it highly.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo (Manchester United)\nThere’s one glaring issue with this transfer: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. They have a habit of botching signings, no matter how brilliant the player was before taking the graveyard shift at Old Trafford.",
      "We want to love this signing. Mbeumo fits Ruben Amorim’s system perfectly. But this club, man. If the ex-Brentford star ends 2025/26 with three goals after scoring 20 last term, we won’t be shocked. But for now, credit where it’s due. On paper, it’s an excellent deal.",
      "",
      "6) Rayan Ait-Nouri (Manchester City)\nPep Guardiola has signalled a readiness to tweak his defensive set-up with the £31m signing of Ait-Nouri from Wolves. The Algerian international is more naturally a wing-back, but we’re confident in his ability to hold his own as an out-and-out full-back.",
      "That’s the role he’ll play at Man City, especially after the left-back spot has been consistently filled by centre-backs. Guardiola’s rotation policy means Josko Gvardiol will still start games there, but his move to left-centre-back could be the most significant outcome of the Ait-Nouri signing.",
      "The former Wolves man boasts 24 goal involvements in 135 Premier League appearances, and his attacking instincts certainly add an edge to a City side that underwhelmed in 2024/25.",

      "",
      "5) Matheus Cunha (Manchester United)\nAnother great player that Manchester United might destroy. Cunha was exceptional for Wolves last season and now finds himself slotted perfectly into Amorim’s system as a left-sided ‘wide 10’.",
      "He and Mbeumo offer something United have been lacking: actual output. Now they just need an elite centre-forward. If they get that piece, top-half football might actually be on the cards. High hopes, we know.",

      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "",
      "4) Caoimhin Kelleher (Brentford)\nAnother intra-Premier League move, Kelleher has finally left Liverpool to spread his wings as a top-flight No.1. As his ranking shows, this looks like an outstanding pick-up for Brentford, who replaced Mark Flekken superbly and sorted the goalkeeper spot early this summer.",
      "Kelleher had to leave, especially with Giorgi Mamardashvili arriving, and considering how brilliant Liverpool are at flogging fringe players, we’re honestly stunned his initial fee is only £12.5million. It could rise to £18m, which is still a steal.",
      "Selling him for half what Jarell Quansah cost Bayer Leverkusen probably sums up Liverpool’s weak stance in transfer talks. Kelleher wanted out, keeping him made little sense, and they weren’t d*cks about it. Brentford will be bloody chuffed.",
      "",
      "3) Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nFinally. Arsenal have signed a striker who isn’t terrified of the 18-yard box. Viktor Gyokeres has been smashing in goals for fun over the last three seasons – 22 in 50 for Coventry, 43 in 49 for Sporting, and then an obscene 54 in 52 last term.",
      "Yes, it’s ‘only the Portuguese league’ and no, he’s not the next Bas Dost. Gyokeres has the strength, speed, work rate, and most importantly, finishing ability, to succeed in Our League. Arsenal now have a proper No.9. It’s about bloody time.",

      "The Dutchman’s arrival was necessary after Kevin De Bruyne’s departure, while Mateo Kovacic and Bernardo Silva are not getting any younger. Reijnders is a different type of midfielder to De Bruyne, but he brings an elite ability to carry the ball up the pitch and combines relentless energy with superb technical quality.",
      "It’s hard to find a downside. City could be utterly unstoppable again in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Liverpool)\nA lot will be made of the £100m transfer fee Liverpool paid, and every single Florian Wirtz touch will be forensically analysed by people who’ve never seen him play before now. Because that’s what really matters – not that the Reds have signed one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and someone who’s world-class at just 22.",
      "The club-record fee was almost enough for Wirtz to drop a place or two here, but purely from a footballing perspective, this comfortably looks like the best signing of the summer…so far.",
      "READ NOW: Florian Wirtz value exposed by quarter-price Rayan Cherki in seven damning stats",

      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",

      "8) Sunderland – £132.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",

      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "",
      "9) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish has joined Everton on loan and reports suggest the Toffees have taken liability for most of his salary for the season.",
      "",
      "7) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably weep weekly when similar amounts leave their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Casemiro’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "",
      "6) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "5) Raheem Sterling (Chelsea) – £325,000 a week\nArsenal copped for around 30% of Sterling’s salary when he was on loan at the Emirates last season but he’s all Chelsea’s problem now. At least appearance money isn’t a problem…",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money, but we remain to see if that remains the case through the deal he recently penned to stay for two more seasons.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. United have tried to shift his salary off their books but with a year to go, so far, there have been no takers. Sounds like a job for the Saudi lads.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. The new deal earned the striker a £2.6million-a-year pay rise and though £41million over two years might terrify the weirdos who think a footballer is finished at 30, it would have cost a sh*te sight more to replace him.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "20) 🔼 Cole Palmer – Chelsea to Manchester City\nAll signs point to this being utter horse sh*t, but with these two clubs, you never quite know. Chelsea would sell if the deal was right because business, and City have form for doing daft things. But surely even they wouldn’t do £200million-plus-£50million for a player they sold for £40million two years ago.",
      "",
      "19) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Manchester City\nWith Grealish gone and interest in Savinho, we could see this happening. And it’s great news for Real, with City, Liverpool and Arsenal threatening a bidding war that didn’t look likely at the start of the summer.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Ibrahima Konate – Liverpool to Chelsea\nThere are whispers that Chelsea will offer £43million for Konate in the wake of Levi Colwill’s knee injury. Liverpool would prefer not to sell to a Premier League rival, but it would see them avoid losing the centre-back for nothing next summer. And they could immediately transfer the cash to Palace for Marc Guehi. So it makes a lot of sense, if they can just park the thought of aiding Chelsea.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But, knowing what we do about both clubs, we just can’t see it this summer. United are still trying, though, bless ’em.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham Hotspur\nApparently, Spurs are very keen on the City winger, though the reports that £43million might do the trick appear to be wide of the mark. Pep Guardiola seems to trust Savinho and we can’t imagine that selling the 21-year-old was part of the plan for this summer. Which makes us wonder what City might be up to…",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThe Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract and has said goodbye to the PSG fans after being ostracised by an unnamed person (it’s Luis Enrique). He looks destined for the Premier League, but United aren’t his most likely destination.",
      "",
      "14) Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation. Nantes’ Matthis Abline is being eyed as a possible replacement should Newcastle come for Larsen.",
      "",
      "13) 🆕 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to AC Milan\nPre-Sesko, the noises coming from Hojlund suggested he wanted to stay at United. Then he watched the Sesko unveiling before staying on the bench for the entirety of the draw with Fiorentina, all of which seems to have opened his mind more to the idea of joining AC Milan. The obvious problem for United: Milan can’t afford the £40million being asked. Mercifully for them, it seems there is a queue starting to form in Italy, with Inter, Roma, Juve and Napoli all jostling for position.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be at least £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "11) Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "10) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak is employing a scorched earth approach to getting out of Newcastle, leaving his legacy in tatters by refusing to play for the club again or reintegrate with Eddie Howe’s squad. It’s a ballsy approach – a d*ckish one too – and Isak needs to hope his desire is matched by Liverpool. We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front. Not one made up of countless add-ons if Isak wins the Ballon d’Or or Grand National.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will definitely leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain, but City are the current frontrunners…",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target and the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. And their dithering could leave the door open for…",
      "",
      "7) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Tottenham\nSpurs’ need for attacking reinforcements is clear and multiple reports suggest they have opened talks about a move for Eze. They, though, do not intend to pay the amount necessary to trigger the England star’s buy-out clause. And the feeling is Eze would prefer Arsenal, which gives Spurs a brief window to strike a deal while their north London neighbours attempt to raise the necessary cash through sales.",
      "",
      "6) 🔽 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £35million-plus-£8million offer, but the Saints want more up front. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training and wasn’t included in Will Still’s squad for their Championship opener, though, so a deal cannot be far off. Could Jack Grealish’s arrival impact things?",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. The best Newcastle have come up so far is £25million but an improved offer is expected this week. They would be wise not to waste theirs and Brentford’s time with another low-ball bid.",
      "",
      "4) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. They are hoping Leipzig take back £40million-rated Christopher Nkunku as part of the deal.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. United wanted at least £40million; we think they will settle for less as the deadline approaches.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nPalace admit they may have to sell Guehi this summer rather than lose a £40million-rated asset for nothing in a year. Liverpool’s struggles in defence against the Eagles in the Community Shield ought to refocus their minds, especially with Chelsea pondering how to fill the void left by Levi Colwill’s injury; not so especially Manchester United’s ‘official approach’ for which huge fistfuls of salt are required. Alas, their interest has intensified and personal terms reportedly agreed.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nIt looks like Forest will win the race for McAtee, who has attracted interest from Germany. Reports suggest he’ll cost north of £20m having agreed personal terms with the City Ground club."

      "Manchester United are considering a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, according to reports.",
      "United have focused heavily on attacking reinforcements this summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Attention is now turning to other areas of Ruben Amorim’s squad, with goalkeeper reportedly identified as a position the club could strengthen if the right opportunity arises.",
      "That opportunity could be presented by Donnarumma’s situation at PSG.",
      "MORE: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "The Italy international was a key figure as Luis Enrique’s side won the Treble in 2024/25, keeping 17 clean sheets in 47 appearances. However, he has been left out of Wednesday’s squad for the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, after the signing of Lucas Chevalier, who is set to become first choice.",
      "With Donnarumma entering the final year of his £300,000-a-week contract, PSG are ‘ready to move him on’ this summer, according to GiveMeSport.",
      "United are understood to be ‘open to taking advantage’ of the situation with a loan offer, with a permanent deal ‘difficult to sanction’.",
      "That stance is largely due to the presence of Andre Onana, with the club reluctant to have two high-earning goalkeepers on their books.",
      "The Red Devils have explored potential exits for the Cameroon international, with interest from Saudi Arabia and AS Monaco earlier in the window, but no agreement has been reached.",
      "The website suggests that United could look to move Onana out on loan, or even keep him to compete with Donnarumma if a financially viable loan arrangement with PSG can be struck.",
      "PSG are not presently open to a loan move for the 26-year-old, preferring to secure a permanent sale. However, the Italian international is unhappy with how he has been treated, which has caught the attention of city rivals Manchester City.",
      "Should any other club attempt to sign Donnarumma permanently, then United’s chances of landing him on loan should be dashed.",
      "The report states:",
      "Any loan deal for the former AC Milan stopper would mean PSG need to change their stance on a loan move though, as PSG are not currently open to that situation. However, the player is disappointed with the way he has been dealt with this summer and it’s possible he could push for an exit on his own terms.",
      "United know what it’s like to get stuck with players they’ve been keen to move, and they could look to use that experience by negotiating terms with PSG that are favorable for all parties.",
      "However, there is a threat that any loan move could fall apart if another club made an offer to sign the player permanently instead, as that is PSG’s preferred option. Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City have both been linked with an interest in the 26-year-old, but sources understand nothing of substance has happened in either case so far.",

      "Manchester United have ‘reached a draft agreement’ to send Rasmus Hojlund to AC Milan, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Hojlund is free to leave Old Trafford following the signing of Benjamin Sesko, who joined the club last week from RB Leipzig for around £73million.",
      "Sesko will be Ruben Amorim’s first-choice centre-forward in 2025/26, opening the door for Hojlund to leave.",
      "The Danish international joined United from Atalanta for a similar fee in 2022, but has failed to make his mark in the Premier League.",
      "He only scored four times in the league last term as the Red Devils finished a shocking 15th place.",
      "After landing wide forwards Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim’s side set their sights on a new No.9, and now that Sesko has joined, the club are pushing to offload Hojlund.",
      "Hojlund was an unused substitute in Saturday’s friendly draw against Fiorentina, which was reportedly a ‘clear message’ that he should look for a new club.",
      "The 22-year-old seems determined to prove himself at Old Trafford and is reluctant to leave.",
      "He said last month: “I am still very young, people sometimes forget that. I am only 22 years old. I have learned a lot, and I think that shows in my game.",
      "“I have done very well so far during the pre-season…I want to stay here.",
      "“Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me! I’m more than ready. I’m feeling sharp, so I’m welcoming everything that comes. I think it’s good with competition.”",
      "But United want to get rid of the player and have reached a ‘draft agreement’ to loan him out to Milan, according to Italian website Calciomercato.",
      "It’s claimed that the Serie A giants are also interested in signing Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic, but know Hojlund will be ‘more affordable’.",
      "Indeed, the United man is ‘the hottest prospect’ with a €4million net salary, compared to Vlahovic’s €12m per year.",
      "Discussions are ongoing but the ‘draft agreement on the deal’s formula and figures’ is confirmed, with United agreeing to loan Hojlund out in a deal worth €6m.",
      "A €40-45m option to buy will also be included, but ‘the player’s approval is still pending’.",
      "It’s added, however, that ‘a transfer market meeting took place today’ (Tuesday) between Hojlund and the Red Devils hierarchy, with the club emphasising their desire for him to move.",
      "Milan might have to move on to alternative targets, which include the more expensive Vlahovic and Paris Saint-Germain’s Goncalo Ramos.",
      "As things stand, it’s likely the Rossoneri do move elsewhere, as Hojlund ‘isn’t yet 100% convinced about leaving, especially since he’s a huge Manchester United fan.’",

      "Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has moved out of his property in the North East as he continues to force a move to Liverpool, according to reports.",
      "Earlier this summer, it had looked unlikely that Liverpool could pull off a move for Isak with the Magpies managing to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "But Isak decided to take matters into his own hands, after an approach from the Reds was pushed away, by telling the Newcastle hierarchy that he wants to leave this summer.",
      "That triggered a £110m bid from Liverpool, which was instantly rejected by the Geordies, and the Merseysiders will only go back in if they receive sufficient encouragement that a deal will be done.",
      "The Athletic‘s David Ornstein revealed earlier on Tuesday that Isak ‘is adamant he will never represent Newcastle again’ despite the Magpies attempting to keep him.",
      "Ornstein added: ‘Even if they refuse to sell the 25-year-old Sweden striker and he remains on Tyneside when the transfer window closes, Isak regards his career at St James’s Park as finished and has no desire to reintegrate into the squad.’",
      "READ: Mailbox: Liverpool have ‘real weakness’ which will have Arsenal ‘licking their lips’ over obvious ‘exploit’",
      "After reports claimed over the weekend that Newcastle had told Isak that he would be going nowhere this summer, Magpies boss Eddie Howe gave an update.",
      "Howe told reporters: “That’s a decision that I won’t make, that will be for other people to make.",
      "“For me, I’m just trying to manage the situation and manage the team, most importantly manage the group of players that I’m working with day to day, that I love coaching and helping.",
      "“We’re focusing on Aston Villa. Everything else, to a degree, from my perspective is not in my control, so it’s not my focus.”",
      "On the specific reports about Isak, he added: “That’s not something I’m aware of. Of course, there’s discussions going on all the time that I’m not party to. I have no knowledge of that.”",

      "And now The Times have claimed that Isak has ‘moved out’ of the home in the North East that he was living and the property was ‘put on the rental market the day after he was omitted from Newcastle United’s players and families day’.",
      "The report added: ‘The property was first put on the market when Isak flew to Spain for personal training rather than take his place on Newcastle’s pre-season trip to Asia on July 24. It was advertised for £6,950 a month on the same day he left for Spain, where he spent time training at Real Sociedad.",
      "‘It was quickly taken off the market and Isak returned to Newcastle, but The Times has learnt the property, empty once more, is back on the market again with a local rental company.’",
      "Newcastle could turn to Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund this summer with the Magpies one of the clubs ‘taking a look’ at the Denmark international.",
      "A report in The Athletic stated: ‘Clubs such as Milan, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Newcastle are taking a look at Hojlund, who at present insists he wants to stay and fight for his place.’",

      "Newcastle star Alexander Isak simply ‘wants a move to another club’. But if he was leaving Liverpool he would be a ‘fraud’, ‘mercenary’ and ‘out of order’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed that Alexander Isak is convinced he will not play for Newcastle again, even if they ‘refuse to sell’ him to Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United are ‘close to a total agreement’ with AC Milan for the 22-year-old, who’s set for ‘direct talks’ with Old Trafford chiefs on Tuesday."

      "Man Utd have been responsible for three of the 20 biggest signings ever involving defenders, while rejecting then buying another who is in the top ten twice.",
      "",
      "1) Harry Maguire – £80m/€97m (Leicester to Man Utd, August 2019)\nAfter vetoing a summer 2018 move for Maguire because of a reticence to pay a potential world-record fee for a defender, Man Utd paid a very much real world-record fee for a defender to sign the Leicester centre-half the following year. And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol – £77m/€89m (Leipzig to Manchester City, August 2023)\nA standout World Cup for Croatia and another season of Bundesliga excellence – although Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland tried their utmost to ruin both respectively – finally earned Gvardiol his long-awaited Premier League move for less than the original world-record demands.",
      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",
      "",
      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",
      "",
      "6) Matthijs de Ligt – £67.8m/€75m (Ajax to Juventus, July 2019)\nWhen the vultures picked at the carcass of Ajax in 2019, De Jong and De Ligt were the parts deemed most succulent. Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Dias – £65m/€71.6m (Benfica to Manchester City, September 2020)\nTwo days after Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 humbling of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola took his Etihad spending on defenders beyond £400m on one of the best of the lot.",
      "",
      "8) Matthijs de Ligt – £62m/€70m (Juventus to Bayern Munich, July 2022)\n“I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody,” De Ligt has said of his brief time in Turin, which he swapped for a role out of the spotlight as the “boss” of Bayern’s defence for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "9) Achraf Hakimi – £60m/€71m (Inter to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2021)\nAfter playing for Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Inter, Hakimi had enough of representing clubs with European pedigree and so rocked up in Paris to win a few domestic trophies and keep Kylian Mbappe company for a bit. Then Mbappe left and PSG won the sodding big one after Hakimi’s muted celebration kicked off a Champions League final dismantling of former club Inter.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Cancelo – £60m/€65m (Juventus to Manchester City, August 2019)\nSwapping places with Danilo, Cancelo went from bit-part player to one of the best in the league, then suddenly a Bayern Munich and Barcelona loanee and Saudi import, all within five ludicrous years.",
      "",
      "11) Aymeric Laporte – £57m/€65m (Athletic Bilbao to Manchester City, January 2018)\nAfter Manchester City balked at the numbers involved in procuring Van Dijk from Southampton, they simply switched them around and went for Laporte in a club-record move instead. It went less well but still OK.",
      "",
      "12) Marc Cucurella – £55m/€68m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt doesn’t feel as though the add-ons potentially taking this deal to £63m were activated in a dreadful couple of years for Cucurella the individual and the Chelsea collective. European Championship glory with Spain sparked a turnaround at club level.",

      "13) Illia Zabarnyi – £54.3m/€63m (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain, August 2025)\nAndoni Iraola would have preferred not to lose his entire centre-half pairing in the same summer Bournemouth also sold their left-back and returned their loanee keeper. But that is the model and such a phenomenal stepping stone must appeal to players.",
      "",
      "14) Leny Yoro – £52.1m/€61.8m (Lille to Man Utd, July 2024)\nAnother £7m in add-ons is built into a deal which saw Manchester United ‘outmanoeuvre’ Real Madrid and Liverpool by spending sums other clubs absolutely did not want to spend on an 18-year-old with 60 first-team career appearances.",
      "",
      "15) Benjamin Mendy – £52m/€57.5m (Monaco to Manchester City, July 2017)\nAn incredibly rare misstep for a Manchester City side which tends to spend such considerable sums well.",
      "",
      "16) David Luiz – £50m/€62.5m (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, June 2014)\nDomestic Quadruples were won in both his full seasons in Paris, before Chelsea bought the Brazilian straight back for £16m less.",
      "",
      "17) Dean Huijsen – £50m/€59.4m (Bournemouth to Real Madrid, June 2025)\nA ridiculous success story for Bournemouth, who plucked Huijsen from a panicking Juventus and flipped a huge profit on the Spanish centre-half within a single season when Real Madrid came calling.",
      "",
      "18) Benjamin White – £50m/€58m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nArsenal started the bidding at £42m and had five offers turned down before acquiescing to Brighton’s initial demand for a guaranteed £50m, and all parties can be happy with their lot.",

      "20) Kyle Walker £50m/€56.7m (Tottenham to Manchester City, July 2017)\nIt seemed preposterous at the time but the only absurd thing six years on is just how much Walker won as a trusted Guardiola lieutenant before both player and club sought something new.",

      "A wantaway Manchester United attacker is said to be liked ‘more than any other attacking option’ on a Serie A club’s shortlist, in a deal which could hurt Juventus after he’d ‘committed’ there.",
      "United have brought in three star attackers this summer in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. United hope the trio will help them to score more goals, with their top-scorers in the Premier League only reaching eight last season.",
      "But after spending around £200million on three attackers, they’ll want to offload some.",
      "Earlier in the window, it was revealed that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia all wanted to leave.",
      "Rashford has gone on loan to Barcelona, and Sancho looked to be closing in on a move to Juventus, with Football Italia reporting he had a ‘commitment’ to join the Italian club, but their one in, one out policy stopped the deal in its tracks.",
      "But there are two more potential destinations for Sancho in Italy, which could hurt Juventus.",
      "Said to not be ‘short of options’, Sancho is on the radar of Inter Milan, with an intermediary having held meetings to discuss the winger’s salary and the potential transfer fee.",
      "But Inter are still holding out for the signing of Ademola Lookman, so with him as the plan A, Sancho is simply a back-up option.",
      "There is also interest from Roma, which seems quite developed. They are said to be in ‘active contact’ and have received detailed information on Sancho.",
      "The United winger is said to be a player that Gian Piero Gasperini likes ‘potentially more than any other attacking option’ on Roma’s shortlist.",
      "However, the report states it ‘remains to be seen’ what decision the winger makes on his future, so it seems there is a chance he might not be open to the move.",
      "That said, he was open to going to Juventus, and they finished just a solitary point ahead of Juventus in Serie A last season. That does mean that Roma were pipped to a Champions League spot by just one point.",
      "However, Sancho was playing UEFA Conference League last season, where he scored twice and assisted five times, which included a goal in the final.",
      "With that said, at least the Europa League would be a higher level than the European competition he was playing in last season.",
      "Having returned to Old Trafford after a failed loan spell at Chelsea, Jadon Sancho is struggling to find his next destination in football.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United flop Jadon Sancho has ‘signalled’ his intention to make a significant ‘sacrifice’ to seal his preferred transfer.",
      "Manchester United star Luke Shaw has given his backing to head coach Ruben Amorim and hit out at four Red Devils “stragglers”.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are back in for Man Utd winger Jadon Sancho as the Red Devils set their asking price for the Juventus target, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are ‘close’ to selling Jadon Sancho to Juventus this summer and the Italian giants have their eye on another Red Devils man, according to reports.",
      "A Man Utd forward reportedly has a ‘full agreement’ to join a European giant with the transfer is ‘increasingly close’ as they also near an agreement with the Red Devils."

      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",

      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",

      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",

      "",
      "15) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",

      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Wednesday 13 August 2025 06:24, UK",
      "No 9s and No 10s have been the talk of the summer and big money has been spent in the pursuit of goals.",
      "Chelsea are hanging their hopes on Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, Arsenal have got all their eggs in the Viktor Gyokeres basket, while Man United have gone wild and revamped their entire forward line by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £207m.",
      "Liverpool have front-loaded, too, splashing a nine-figure sum on Florian Wirtz before pushing overall spending beyond the £250m mark with a £79m outlay on Hugo Ekitike.",
      "And we are yet to reach a conclusion on the Alexander Isak saga, with any potential fee for the Newcastle forward likely to eclipse anything we have seen so far. So, who has spent wisely? And how will each team best utilise their new weapons in the hunt for Premier League glory?",
      "After their worst season in 51 years, the only way is up for Man United and their shiny new three-pronged attack, moulded in the shape of Ruben Amorim's famous 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim always maintained, given the choice, he would not have taken on the unenviable task of awakening English football's most successful club from its decade-long malaise midway through a season, had the proposal not been 'now or never'.",
      "What followed was fairly disastrous: most defeats (18), fewest points (42) and fewest goals (44) in the club's Premier League history. But now, with a full pre-season to impart his particular style and the tools with which to make it succeed, can we expect an upturn?",
      "Mbeumo and Sesko are exciting additions. Both had offers from other clubs and still chose Man United, despite no participation in European competition for the first time in 11 years and no title since 2013.",
      "Sesko hit 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season, finishing with 39 in 87 appearances overall. His pace, movement and sharp finishing should suit Amorim's fluid attack, with Mbeumo and Cunha doing the creative work.",
      "Some daunting early fixtures, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea in their opening five games, will stress test that theory. Clearly all three have proven pedigree - each is an obvious improvement on the luckless Rasmus Hojlund - but whether they offer the right balance of creativity to goal threat will have to be judged at a later date. Suffice to say, 44 is not a difficult tally to beat.",
      "Most believe both Wirtz and Ekitike to be the real deal despite their relatively modest ages. The latter scored 15 goals and assisted eight more in 33 Bundesliga games for Eintracht Frankfurt last season, while Wirtz just makes playing football look frightfully easy.",
      "Over the last two years, the German international landed 67 goal involvements in 75 matches across all competitions for Bayer Leverkusen, with an equally efficient split of 34 goals to 33 assists.",
      "Both are model forwards for fast transitions and have an ability to play between the lines, ready to complement Liverpool's already abundant attacking riches. Mohamed Salah's eyes must have lit up when Wirtz walked through the door at Melwood - a quick, skilful, progressive playmaker with shades of Kevin De Bruyne? Yes please.",
      "In Arne Slot style, expect aggressive counter-pressing too.",
      "Chemistry between Wirtz and Ekitike already shows outstanding promise. This is an ominous development in the evolution of Slot's incumbent champions.",
      "Let's be honest, Arsenal have been fudging it for years, somehow managing to get away with scoring enough goals to satisfy consecutive second-place finishes thanks to the brilliance of Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard. Not nearly enough for a title, though.",
      "Every transfer window teased a big-name signing without ever actually delivering on that pledge. Until now.",
      "Gyokeres \"will destroy defenders\", insisted Mikel Arteta last weekend. Perhaps the fact he has been given Thierry Henry's iconic #14 shirt is intentionally foreboding. Like the legendary Frenchman, Gyokeres thrives within the width of the posts. He has a desire to stay on the last line, complete with intimidating physicality and running power.",
      "A forward who can charge through defences and speed up attacks - scoring 23 times from fast breaks last year - will aid Arsenal's plight greatly. And most importantly, no player in Europe's top eight divisions matched Gyokeres' 39 league goals for Sporting.",
      "In fact, across his two seasons in Portugal, Gyokeres hit Erling Haaland-level numbers: 79 goals in 83 matches in the Primeira Liga and Champions League, proving he might very well be the missing piece in Arsenal's title-chasing dream.",
      "Chelsea's willingness to part with big sums of cash has been a transfer market staple ever since Todd Boehly took a controlling stake at Stamford Bridge just over three years ago.",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the introduction of the Premier League's PSR rules, they were the only club keeping the magic of the transfer window alive. Now others have caught up, but we still thank Boehly for plugging the intrigue gap.",
      "And yet Chelsea's latest spree is more interesting still, as newcomers Delap and Pedro jostle for first-choice striker. The Brazilian is arguably more mobile and dynamic than Delap, but has struggled to stay injury-free over the past 12 months.",
      "His versatility across a fluid frontline will nevertheless be helpful to Enzo Maresca, who could use Pedro as a second striker behind the former Ipswich target man if he so wishes - or even on the wing.",
      "Delap, meanwhile, has already shown himself to be a good ally to Chelsea's greatest asset, Cole Palmer. The pair were prolific for Manchester City's youth teams in years gone by.",
      "Pedro and Delap, both on the scoresheet as Chelsea thrashed AC Milan in a recent pre-season friendly, registered a combined 30 goal contributions in the Premier League last season (22G, 8A) and that kind of firepower can sustain a meaningful title charge - at least beyond Christmas, which is realistically where Chelsea's ended last term.",
      "Pep Guardiola professed not to want wholesale change at Manchester City midway through last season's disastrous collapse, but that appears to be what he's got. City went big in January and have invested further this summer.",
      "Rayan Cherki has drawn most excitement, not least because of comparisons with one Lionel Messi - which may have as much to do with his short stature as his impressive close ball control, but any association with the great Argentinian has got to be deemed favourable.",
      "A Messi-like ability to open up a game is what was captured in glimpses for Lyon last season, particularly noticeable in Europa League performances, with 12 goal contributions from 11 starts.",
      "Of course, City do not need another marquee No 9 signing, they have Haaland, who will be buoyed by the addition of Cherki to supplement his own goal-scoring habits as City bid to forcibly reassert themselves back in the title picture. Things just got interesting.",

      "Ready to do it all again? The 2025/26 Premier League season is here; An epic title race awaits, goals are guaranteed & newly promoted teams up for the scrap; \"The Premier League is on a completely different level to anything else in world football,\" says Jamie Carragher",
      "Tuesday 12 August 2025 14:04, UK",
      "The Premier League is back and has all the ingredients in the mix for this season to have serious G.O.A.T potential.",
      "For most of us the Premier League runs through our veins. Admit it, a little part of us has been missing these past few months. It is part of the fabric of society in this country - of why we all love this game.",
      "Stadiums are packed as the world watches on. There's a reason why.",
      "Epic rivalries. Tales of heroes and villains. World-class talent. The best of the best competing for high stakes. And what that equates to is this league being able to produce moments like no other.",
      "Wayne Rooney's first Everton goal that meant his world would never be the same again. Thierry Henry turning it on against Liverpool, bewildering our very own Jamie Carragher along the way, to keep Arsenal on track in the title race.",
      "David Beckham from halfway. Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira. Collymore closing in.",
      "Aguerooooo.",
      "Kevin Keegan loving it.",
      "Andrea Bocelli, Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City.",
      "Well, it's time to create new moments that are stamped in our memory banks as the 2025/26 Premier League rolls into town. And all the ingredients have been added to the pot to make this season one of the greats.",
      "Maybe the greatest.",
      "Let's not sugar-coat it, Arne Slot's impact at Liverpool made last season's title race a non-event.",
      "The title was all wrapped up by February as Liverpool roared clear in what was a one-horse race after beating Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Not this season.",
      "A more intense title battle will be on the cards.",
      "Super 6 returns this Saturday - £1,000,000 'TIL IT'S WON!",
      "A look at the betting provides such evidence. Rarely do you see a major league with FOUR teams priced up in single figures with Liverpool (13/8), Arsenal (2/1), Manchester City (3/1) and Chelsea (8/1) all taking up a huge percentage of the market.",
      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "With the £50m revamp of their Carrington training ground also unveiled this week, there is a growing sense of renewal at United, although it did not take long for Fiorentina to pierce that when Simon Sohm seized upon sloppy defending to put the visitors ahead at a corner.",
      "United levelled it up midway through the first half when Bruno Fernandes whipped in a cross that Robin Gosens appeared to divert over the line amid a melee of bodies. David de Gea, honoured beforehand by his old club, was among those complaining of a foul.",
      "Sohm almost scored again after the break, striking the United crossbar. Fernandes, Harry Maguire and, in particular, Cunha searched for a winner for the home side in a second half that saw young defender Ayden Heaven depart the field due to an injury.",

      "Manchester United have completed a £73.7m deal to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "In his first interview as a Man Utd player, Sesko said: \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",
      "Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",
      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben Amorim and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",
      "Sesko's signing will raise further questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford. It is understood the club would consider offers of around £40m for the player, and AC Milan are interested.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "Manchester United's deal for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement. However, with Sesko now heading to Manchester, it puts any possible move for Isak into doubt.",
