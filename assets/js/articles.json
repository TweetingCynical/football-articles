      "Al Hilal are refusing to give up on an eye-watering transfer deal for Bruno Fernandes - as club chiefs officials line up a third meeting with his representatives. Fahad bin Nafel, who is the president of the Saudi Pro League club, is understood to have met with Bruno Fernandes' agent Miguel Ruben and lawyer Caetano Maria on Monday.",
      "During those discussions, Al Hilal presented a lucrative three-year contract offer for the Manchester United captain but the proposal was politely rejected by Fernandes' inner circle.",
      "United are not willing to entertain a sale and insist the Portugal international is integral to their plans - a stance publicly communicated by Ruben Amorim in recent days - and equally, the 30-year-old remains committed to his Old Trafford contract which runs until the summer of 2027.",
      "However, Saudi sources have indicated that Al Hilal are yet to concede defeat and they're planning a third sit-down with Fernandes' camp.",
      "The first meeting between the parties is understood to have taken place in London but financials were not discussed.",
      "Now Al Hilal are keen to launch one final push, they believe a third round of discussions are on the agenda and they are willing to show notable flexibility on potential salary demands in a bid to turn the player's head.",
      "Newcastle captain Bruno Guimaraes and Aston Villa star Youri Tielemans have also attracted admirers at Al Hilal and could emerge as alternative targets if a deal for Fernandes proves out of reach. Al Hilal's interest in Fernandes is long-standing and their previous advances for his services were swiftly shot down in 2023 and 2024.",
      "The Saudi giants would like to bolster their squad with an array of superstar signings for the Club World Cup ahead of their Group H opener against Real Madrid on June 18.",
      "Fernandes has 19 goals and 19 assists in all competitions this season and Manchester United's summer transfer budget is expected to be dictated by the result of their Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Amorim said ahead of their 4-1 semi-final victory over Athletic Club: \"Our idea didn't change. We want to keep the best players - and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world. We want Bruno here.",
      "\"It is easy to understand [his importance] - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays and the importance he has during his five years here. It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno. He is a leader and he's the captain, so he's really important. He is a top player, we need top players.\"",
      "Fernandes wants to win silverware at United and it's clear the team is on an upwards trajectory under Amorim with an series of big-name signings planned - Matheus Cunha, Viktor Gyokeres, Liam Delap, Jonathan Tah and Bryan Mbeumo are among their targets - in the upcoming months."

      "United are open to selling almost every player on their books as Ruben Amorim looks to lead a much needed overhaul. Even academy star Kobbie Mainoo could be moved on should the club receive an offer they deem suitable.",
      "Fernandes is perhaps their most prized asset and would command the greatest fee in the market, but Scholes is adamant he must be retained at any cost, despite the riches than could be waved United's way from Saudi Arabia. They have spare cash after missing out on Mohamed Salah.",
      "United's skipper has scored 19 times in all competitions - his highest number since his first full season - and continues to produce in the big moments. Scholes has claimed that Fernandes has to be the player the club build their team around.",
      "\"It’s quite clear that they need to keep him and build a team around him. It’s just whether they get the option to do that with having money to buy new players and adding space in the squad to bring new players in.",
      "\"With the deals that the club have done in the last few years, it’s going to be very difficult for Amorim to get rid of people. If you get into the Champions League, it’s going to be quite easy to bring people in, but at the same time, you’ve got to get people out and that’s going to be the hardest part of his job.\"",
      "Amorim has maintained that United want to retain Fernandes and will not be allowing him to leave this summer. “I think it is easy to understand [his importance], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,” he said.",
      "“He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he’s the captain, so he’s really important.

Amorim made major changes to the starting XI for last week's defeat at Brentford, including leaving captain Bruno Fernandes on the bench, in order to keep players fresh to face Athletic Club on Thursday.",
      "United lost 4-3 at the Gtech and then fell behind early on in their Europa League semi-final second leg. They rebounded in style, though, scoring four times in the final 20 minutes to wrap up a 7-1 aggregate victory, but Scholes believes his old employers are taking a big risk.",
      "\"It’s almost as if they go into Premier League games and there’s an acceptance that they’re not going to win the game, which is madness. I think the acceptance has come from everyone.",
      "\"I think it’s come from the manager even though he won’t admit it. He’s not playing teams to win games of football in the league. I think even fans are thinking let’s get these league games out of the way because the league has been a disaster.\"",
      "United aren't the only ones who have attempted to shuffle the pack in the league while competing in Europe. It didn't quite work for Arsenal, who lost their Champions League semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, but Spurs' rotation at West Ham last week left them fresh to beat Bodo/Glimt and join Amorim's team in the Europa League final.",
      "Ahead of Sunday's match, Amorim was asked whether he would continue resting senior stars now that a spot in the final has been secured. \"No, they will play because sometimes it's better to play,\" he replied.",
      "\"What I will protect is the players that can get an injury. For example, Bruno, or the last game before Tottenham but we moved the game to the Friday against Chelsea. So we'll have time to recover.",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane once admitted that he financially benefited from the Glazer family's takeover of the club. The American ownership has been a contentious issue among fans since they acquired the club 20 years ago.",
      "Writing in his 2014 autobiography, The Second Half, Keane revealed his smart idea to pocket shares in United as part of his contract, meaning he saw a small fortune head his way thanks to the family's acquisition of the Red Devils.",
      "\"From the players’ point of view, it didn’t bother us too much,\" Keane, 53, wrote. \"I had a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me\".",
      "The Glazers are now approaching two decades at the helm of United, having acquired the club from Irish shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus for £790million on May 12, 2005. Initially holding a 57 per cent stake, they increased it to 75 per cent just days later.",
      "Despite the team's early successes under their ownership, including five Premier League titles, the 2008 Champions League, two FA Cups, six League Cups, the Europa League, and the FIFA World Club Cup, fans have expressed concerns about the Glazers draining the club's resources.",
      "Their tenure has been marred by fan protests and widespread dissatisfaction with their management of the club. And the situation reached a head in 2022.",
      "Their reign at the helm of United seemed on the brink in November of that year when they announced the club was up for sale. Keane hailed the move as \"good news\" at the time, criticising the family for prioritising business over their rapport with the supporters.",
      "However, the plot took a twist when Sir Jim Ratcliffe instead acquired a minority 25 per cent share, leaving the Americans in post but with Ratcliffe and his INEOS team taking control of football operations. However, United's financial woes have persisted, with debts mounting and job cuts becoming a regularity under Ratcliffe's time in charge.",
      "While Keane may have profited from the initial sale, he has since been vocal about his disapproval of United's current management. In October 2024, he lamented the transformation of the club on the Stick to Football podcast.",
      "\"United was always about good people and good characters, but I don't see that now. I don't recognise this team, I don't recognise the club,\" he said.",
      "\"They're chopping and changing and getting rid of everyone in the background which is fine, there's a business side to it, we know that. But when we're discussing Man United, it's more like a business than a football club\"."

But he has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks and has been called upon in some crucial matches in United's run to the Europa League final.",

      "One issue also scuppering any transfer is that he could be in for a massive pay rise if Amorim's squad clinches the Europa League title. The ex-Real Madrid star has a clause in his contract that guarantees him a hefty 25 percent wage increase if the Red Devils secure their place back in the Champions League.",
      "If United triumph in the Europa League final in Bilbao on May 21, this would mean an astonishing £100,000-a-week boost for Casemiro, pushing his weekly earnings to a whopping £500,000.",
      "That, added to the fact he's more than settled in Manchester, means the Brazilian doesn't want to depart. As such, a lucrative switch to the Saudi Pro League is now OFF the table for Casemiro, who could now end up seeing out his career in the Premier League.",
      "United are expected to be active in the transfer market and reinforcements in midfield would have been required should they have decided to offload Casemiro, who joined the club back in the summer of 2022.",

      "The squad he will inherit will instantly be bolstered by the capture of Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is joining Real on a free transfer. But Alonso will not step there. As revealed by AS, he is intent on pursuing deals for Martin Zubimendi, Jonathan Tah and Florian Wirtz this summer, even if doing so will be anything but straightforward.",

      "Arsenal and Manchester United could both miss out on the signing of Viktor Gyokeres - because their kits are supplied by Adidas. Gyokeres is set to be one of the summer's hot properties having scored a staggering 52 goals in 48 games for Sporting Lisbon this season.",
      "The 26-year-old is in his second season in Portugal after arriving from Coventry City. He fired Sporting to the Primeira Liga title last term, with the team currently sitting top again this year with two games to play.",
      "While he has another three years to run on his contract at the Estádio José Alvalade, it is increasingly unlikely he will remain in Lisbon for next season. The Gunners and United are both among the favourites to sign the Swedish international.",
      "Both of the Premier League sides are desperate for reinforcements in attack after disappointing seasons. But they face intense competition from many of Europe's other top teams.",
      "One of them is Atletico Madrid, who are keen to restore themselves back to the top of Spanish football. Atletico last won La Liga in 2021 and have selected Gyokeres as a potential target for the summer, with a major advantage now emerging for Diego Simeone.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo, Atletico have made a formal enquiry about a move. The Spanish side are said to view their chances of signing him as being slim, though kit suppliers Nike could step in to secure a deal.",
      "The American company recently inked a long-term contract renewal with Atletico. They are said to see Gyokeres as 'one of the sensations of the moment' and are keen for him to join one of the clubs they sponsor.",
      "It is claimed that to avoid him wearing another clothing brand, they would even be willing to contribute towards Gyokeres' signing. Nike fear a similar situation to when Cristiano Ronaldo was sponsored by them but played for Real Madrid, whose kits are supplied by Adidas.",
      "Arsenal's deal with Adidas runs until 2030, while United's agreement with the German giant has another 10 years to run. It appears increasingly likely that an almighty battle will be fought for Gyokeres this summer, with Sporting boss Rui Borges recently dropping a clear hint he will be on the move.",
      "\"Viktor is a player... I think there are no words: it is unlikely that another player of his quality will emerge in our league over the next few years,\" Borges said last month. \"He is clearly above average. Sporting recognised his talent, and here we are.",
      "\"Fortunately, we have him at Sporting. We must make the most of the time we have with him because he is truly exceptional. I have said this before, and I will continue to say it: he brings a lot to the team, and his teammates are aware of what he contributes, which is why they look for him during games.",
      "\"The collective effort also plays a role, as no one can succeed alone. Viktor is a game-changer, and he will continue to be, whether with us or elsewhere. His quality is undeniable; it is phenomenal.",
      "\"He is the best in the league, clearly. There are no adjectives to describe Viktor. He is an extraordinary striker, very important to our team, he has helped the team to grow with confidence, quality of play, he passes it on to his team-mates.\""

      "Manchester United fans finally have a reason to smile. Ruben Amorim's men are through to the Europa League final after staving off a comeback from Athletic Bilbao in Thursday's semi-final second leg.",
      "United were the weaker side for most of the game but ended up romping to a 4-1 win, meaning that the tie finished 7-1 on aggregate. A brace from super sub Mason Mount as well as strikes from Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund booked the Red Devils a ticket to Bilbao on Wednesday, May 21.",
      "They'll face Premier League rivals Tottenham, a team which they've already lost to three times this season, in a two-fold final. Victory would not only mean that United have won a trophy in each of the last three years while marking Amorim's first taste silverware at Old Trafford, it'd see them qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the rest of the club's hierarchy are desperate to see United back among Europe's elite not just for the prestige but the financial rewarded. The near-£100million boost would allow the Red Devils to splash more cash in the summer transfer window, although not everyone on their list of targets will require fee.",
      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have the funds to sign Liam Delap this summer but any potential deal is expected to take some time. Delap, 22, is United's top target for a new striker in the window but the Red Devils could face competition from Chelsea and Manchester City.",
      "The England under-21 international is understood to have a £30million release clause in his Ipswich contract which became active following the Tractor Boys' relegation from the Premier League. The Athletic report that United have enough cash at their disposal to sign Delap but are waiting on his decision.",
      "Manchester United have entered the race to sign Bayer Leverkusen star Jonathan Tah on a free transfer. Germany international Tah has confirmed that he'll become a free agent when his contract at Leverkusen expires on July 1.",
      "Reports from Germany say that United are 'serious competitors' for the 29-year-old, with the Red Devils on the lookout for a new centre-back. Tah has also been linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, who tried to sign him last summer.",
      "Barcelona will listen to offers for vice-captain Ronald Araujo after his Champions League woes. Araujo, 26, apologised to fans on social media after being blamed for two of Inter Milan's goals during their agonising semi-final defeat on Tuesday.",
      "Despite his status at Barca, the Uruguayan defender - who can play at centre-back or right-back - is set to be available for €50m (£42m), according to Fichajes. Manchester United have been linked with Araujo before and want to sign a centre-back in light of Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans' respective contracts ending next month."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has made it clear that he's a huge fan of Casemiro, who's in for a massive pay rise if they win the Europa League final. Casemiro, 33, scored to put United in the lead as they came from behind to beat Athletic Bilbao 4-1 in their semi-final second leg on Thursday.",
      "Now the Red Devils have the chance to win the competition and in turn qualify for next season's Champions League. Playing in Europe's elite competition would earn the club between £80million and £100m - but it would also cost them.",
      "Casemiro's salary has been at the centre of speculation over his future, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe keen to lower the wage budget at Old Trafford and reportedly identifying the Brazilian as the kind of big-money signing that United shouldn't have made. But Amorim's opinion could weigh heavily, as the Red Devils boss appears to love working with Casemiro.",
      "Having scored the goal which put United 2-1 up against Bilbao, the former Real Madrid stalwart was immediately substituted and Amorim gave him a big hug to congratulate his performance, prompting a huge cheer from the crowd. Casemiro also bagged a goal in the first leg and was decisive with two assists at home to Lyon during United's dramatic quarter-final win last month.",
      "The Brazil international has gone from a much-maligned figure during Erik ten Hag's final months in charge to a key player for Amorim. The pair didn't click instantly, though, as Casemiro only started one of the Red Devils' 14 games between mid-December and the start of February, playing a possible 136 minutes out of a potential 1,290 minutes.",
      "\"We are in a league where there is a big intensity difference. Therefore I feel our team needs players with high intensity and sometimes we don't have them.\"",
      "Will Manchester United win the Europa League final? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Things have changed in terms of his playing time, although Casemiro is still up for sale - much like the rest of United's squad. Their looming bottom-half finish in the Premier League can't be ignored and the 33-year-old was part of a midfield which was dominated by Bilbao's for the first 70 minutes on Thursday.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been mooted as the likely destination, with Ronaldo's Al-Nassr reportedly keen. But could the riches of Saudi Arabian tempt him away?",
      "\"I have one-and-a-half years left on my contract and I would like to finish it here in Manchester,\" Casemiro told AS in February. \"I am comfortable here and so is my family. They have adapted, we speak English. I'm very grateful to the fans at Old Trafford and to the club. I am happy at club level. Happy on the bench? Of course not. That's something else.\""

      "A move for Antony will prove 'very, very complicated' according to Real Betis chief Angel Haro. The club's president is already planning a meeting with Manchester United to extend the Brazilian's stay with the La Liga club but Haro is refusing to get ahead of himself.",
      "Antony has hit the ground running since arriving in the south of Spain on loan from United and proven a key player in Betis' side. Already the 25-year-old has scored eight goals and added five assists in 21 games for Betis, having scored just 12 times in his entire United spell since his blockbuster move.",
      "The ex-Ajax star looks set to depart Old Trafford once his loan ends having failed to break into Ruben Amorim's plans this season. While Betis appear a strong, early contender, United are likely to prefer a permanent deal where they can bring in a fee for the star.",
      "And Betis president Haro is well aware the task of securing the player's signature will not come easily, despite his apparent willingess to contnue at the club. The first task remains to prove persuading to the Red Devils.",
      "\"Keeping Antony as our own is very, very complicated,\" he said. \"We'll have a meeting with Manchester United to extend the loan for another year, to be able to share a percentage of the player.",
      "\"It's about seeing the willingness of the player and Manchester United. The first filter is set by Manchester, and then the negotiation of the player would come, but that’s a long way off.",

      "“It's important to score goals and provide assists but for me what's most important is sleeping peacefully knowing how I'm doing with myself and being well and happy. Seeing my family smiling is also essential for me; I always talk to my family in Brazil and they are also very happy for me.”"

If Amorim leads Manchester United back into Europe’s elite, or if Postecoglou maintains his record of winning a trophy in his second season with every club as a manager, it will paper over a lot of cracks.",
      "United have lost 16 out of 35 Premier League games this season and Spurs have lost 19. That’s absolutely shocking for clubs of their stature. But the all-English Europa League final in Bilbao later this month will offer one of them a get-out-of-jail pass, a golden ticket back to the big time.",
      "Tottenham have beaten United three times already this season, so they may be slight favourites. United, on the other hand, are the only club to go unbeaten through the whole Europa League campaign and Bruno Fernandes has provided a record number of assists in the competition.",
      "Do they have an advantage after playing in Bilbao only last week? I’m not so sure that’s relevant in a one-off cup final, although when United pitch up again at the San Mames they will know where the dressing rooms are and get their bearings quicker.",
      "United were twitchy for a while in their semi-final second leg at Old Trafford on Thursday night. When Mikel Jauregizar made a dent in United’s three-goal advantage from the first leg, you could sense the nervous shuffling of feet and anxiety around the place.",

      "It is always better to be pro-active than reactive with your subs, and United were losing control in midfield until Mason Mount came off the bench to enjoy the best half-hour of his career.",
      "His two goals were magnificent, and his all-round contribution - with Bruno dropping deeper to the No.6 role - was unbelievable. Mount’s United career has been tormented by a series of injury setbacks which have limited him to just 10 Premier League starts in two seasons.",
      "But he chose the perfect night to step up when Bilbao were threatening to become the first team in 134 ties to overturn a three-goal deficit from the first leg away from home. And for United to score seven goals across two legs against a side with the best defensive record in La Liga speaks volumes.",
      "Tottenham showed good character and sound game management to negotiate cold weather in the Arctic circle and Bodo/Glimt’s artificial pitch, and it should be a cracking final.",
      "Are United and Spurs the two worst teams, in terms of their domestic league positions, to contest a major European final? That’s debatable, although Aston Villa won the European Cup 43 years ago in a season where they finished 11th in the old First Division, so it’s not unprecedented for an English club to strike glory in Europe while going nowhere in the league at home.",
      "Yes, a trophy and Champions League football will paper over the cracks and camouflage a multitude of problems for Amorim or Big Ange.",
      "But like Newcastle, who are also likely to land a Champions League spot next season, one of them is going to win more trophies than Arsenal this season. And for Gunners fans, that’s got to hurt."

      "In recent years, Manchester United have had their fair share of transfer mishaps - and letting Scott McTominay is leave is looking like one of the worst. Since joining Napoli last summer, the Scotland international has lit up the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium with his energy, grit and goals, becoming a driving force behind the club's Serie A title push.",
      "Despite being one of United's more consistent performers during a turbulent period, McTominay was never truly celebrated at Old Trafford. That isn't the case in Naples, where the fans have rallied around him, nicknaming him 'McFratm' - a blend of his surname and the local word 'fratm', meaning 'bro'.",
      "Another moniker he's earned, 'The Bottle Opener', speaks to his knack for delivering breakthrough goals when they're most needed. But it isn't just his popularity that's surged - his market value has too.",
      "Napoli snapped him up for £25million, but his estimated value now sits at €40m (£34m), according to Transfermarkt. This rise is especially striking given his age of 28, and that his highest valuation at United topped out at £29m - offering yet another indicator of the club's inability to recognise what they had.",
      "Italian football icon Massimo Ambrosini has credited Napoli boss Antonio Conte with unlocking McTominay's full potential. \"His value has only gone up since he left Manchester United and the reason for that is Antonio Conte,\" he told JeffBet.",
      "\"Conte has created a team that gets the best out of his players and McTominay is perfect in the middle behind Romelu Lukaku. His value has definitely increased this season and I think that is down to the manager.\"",
      "With 12 goals in 33 matches - including 11 in the league - McTominay has been a major influence on Napoli's campaign. Holding a three-point lead atop the table, they're in a strong position to finish the season as champions if they maintain composure in their final trio of games.",
      "McTominay has delivered time and again with his performances and particularly with his goals, whether breaking the deadlock, equalising, or sealing victories. \"Scott is a complete player,\" Conte said back in September. \"He's versatile, who can be a trequartista behind the striker, he can be a mezzala in a three-man midfield, play in a two-man midfield or even wide in a 5-4-1 with licence to attack.\"",
      "More recently, Conte claimed that United consistently deployed McTominay poorly, failing to recognise what his true qualities were. \"He never had a main role at United that instead we have given him here,\" the coach said. \"He has grown a lot by working. Today he is [a] complete [player].\"",
      "Should Napoli finish the season as champions, it would mark only their second title since the Maradona era and just the fourth in their history. Their emotional 2022/23 triumph, led by superstar attackers Victor Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, ended a more than 30-year wait.",
      "With both players having moved on, winning again this season would be a stunning feat. And with McTominay emerging as a new leader, Napoli may have found the next piece in their legacy-building puzzle - proof that great players don't always come with great fanfare."

      "Micky van de Ven insists Tottenham have \"nothing to fear\" against Manchester United in the Europa League final. The imperious Dutchman, who marshalled the Spurs defence to a second successive European away clean sheet in Norway against Bodo/Glimt, said of Ruben Amorim's side: \"They played Athletic Club, a really good team and it was 7-1 over the two games. \"So they've also shown some real quality in Europe. We knew it's going to be a different game, everything can happen in a final but we're not going there with fear, of course. \"We know our qualities, we know it's going to be a difficult game as Man United have also shown their quality in this European campaign.\"",
      "Tottenham are bidding to end their 17-year wait for silverware, however, it's also been 41 years since they last lifted a European trophy (UEFA Cup). Van de Ven is confident Ange Postecoglou's troops can now finally end that hoodoo by finishing a difficult season on the greatest of highs. He continued: \"Everybody goes to Bilbao to win a trophy. It has been a tough season and it will only be successful if we win the Europa League and get that trophy. \"To be in a European final with Tottenham is a big thing for the fans, the club and me personally, I'm really proud to be part of it. Van de Ven, who only played 135 minutes of Spurs' group campaign due to a hamstring injury, starred alongside influential captain Cristian Romero in Thursday's gritty victory inside the Arctic Circle. He paid tribute to the indispensable Argentine, hailing a captain's performance in the absence of injured skipper Heung-min Son.",
      "The 24-year-old said: \"Cuti's an unbelievable player. You can see that mentality wise. With the ball, without the ball, he knows how it is to play these types of games. \"You can see it in how he is, he shows so much to the rest, he helps the whole team. My partnership with Cuti we feel each other, he knows what to do, I know what to do, we back each other.\" Dominic Solanke, who netted in both legs of the semi-final, has warned his team-mates they cannot get trapped into thinking they have United's number - just because they've beaten them three times already this season. When asked if those victories can give Spurs confidence, he said: “Yeah, a little bit, but obviously it’s going to be a completely different game, different circumstances. “Finals are never easy. We’re both in the final for a reason, we’ve both done well in Europe, so we know it’s going to be a difficult game. Pressure is a privilege, when you’re at big clubs, you always want to be fighting for silverware\""

      "He ticked an awful lot of Bernabeu boxes. But Manchester United and INEOS acted decisively, knowing it would take big money - both in terms of transfer fee and salary - to tempt Yoro to Old Trafford.",
      "But in the form of a £52million fee and a five-year deal that started at £150,000 for an 18-year-old defender, they tabled big money. A pre-season injury was part of an unfortunate start to Yoro’s United career and he was hardly convincing in his early games for Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there are signs that Yoro, now 19, might just represent a rarity … an INEOS masterstroke. In his recent performances, he has been consistently good and was outstanding in the 4-1 win over Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final second leg at Old Trafford.",
      "From the time he was repeatedly skinned by Southampton’s Kamaldeen Sulemana back in January, it was clear that Yoro’s defensive approach is not based on raw speed. Instead, he is proving to be a fine reader of a game, astute with his interventions and an intelligent distributor of the ball.",
      "Remember any United centre-halves with that skill set? Yes - and it is no surprise Yoro has been picking his brains.",
      "“I speak a lot with the coach and I’ve spoken to Rio (Ferdinand) and not always in front of the cameras,” says Yoro. “Sometimes, they just give me advice. When a player like Rio can give you advice, then you need to take it.”",
      "And as the comparisons to Ferdinand began to be taken a touch more seriously, it is clear to see they are giving the young French defender a lift. He goes on: “Of course I come to Man United to achieve big things, to win trophies.",
      "\"So, when you see players like Rio Ferdinand, (Nemanja) Vidic and (Raphael) Varane, you want to achieve the same things as them, you want to stay in the memory of fans and be a big defender. When they compare me to them it’s a real honour, I’m proud of this.”",
      "An odd report from Spain last week suggested his camp were exploring the possibility of getting him to Real Madrid after United's disappointing Premier League campaign. But Yoro looks like a player who is beginning to revel in the challenge facing United players of this era.",
      "He says: “It was difficult for me in the beginning with the injury and even with my performances on the pitch when I first returned but now I’m 100 percent, I am starting to be good and I hope to be like that until the end of the season and into next season. I feel confident.”",
      "And looking ahead to the Europa League final against Spurs, Yoro is, of course, determined to start his United medal collection, declaring: “This is a club of trophies. When you play for Manchester United you need to feel this. We are Manchester United and we need to win trophies.”"

      "A former hooligan recalled risking his life on a brutal away day where he claimed ambushing fans were armed with bricks and Stanley knives. Tony O’Neill was once regarded as Britain’s most notorious football hooligan. Back in the 1970s, he became a key figure in two Manchester United firms, Red Army and later the Casuals, and hewas known as ‘the general’.",
      "But on April 23, 1974, he travelled to Merseyside when he was just 15 to watch a soon to be relegated United take on Everton at Goodison Park. And speaking on his Webby & O’Neill YouTube channel for his ‘Fan Culture' series, he spoke about the chaos that unfolded.",
      "His mum initially forbade him from going but eventually he joined up with The Red Army who made their way to Liverpool.",
      "He said people had been speaking about the game for weeks. Tony remembered: “We knew what we was up against. This was going to be war. And I mean war. We were going to take on the scousers.”",
      "He said hundreds of United fans packed the trains before arriving at Lime Street Station where trouble immediately broke out. Tony said the group stood their ground before being welcomed by bricks once they started to make their way to the football stadium.",
      "“Bricks came flying over at us while we were on the march,” he said. “What a solid march, but a frightening walk if you were on your own or in small groups. But not this gang, this gang was massive and it was solid. There was no moving it.”",
      "He said this was a victory for the firm but the real violence took place after the match where Everton came out 1-0 winners in what was a night game.",
      "“I was depressed because I knew we were going down,” Tony recalled. “But we knew what we had to do. The gates open and we have got to be at the front. We knew the rules going there. This has always been the motto, go out there and whatever happens, happens. Take it to them. Don’t go hiding, don’t be sneaking off, especially in Merseyside.”",
      "Fights broke out outside Goodison Park but disputes between United fans took place where some wanted to get on coaches back to Lime Street and others wanted to march back.",
      "Tony was one of the ones who walked and he said it was “absolutely stupid” and the \"daftest thing you can do in the dark at Merseyside”. “You are going taking your life in your hands,” he added.",
      "Despite knowing he was going to get ambushed, Tony and the now smaller mob reached the end of Stanley Park, and that’s when the real danger commenced.",
      "“That was the nightmare of all nightmares,” he recalled. “They all were Liverpool fans. They just come screaming down the side street, straight into us.",
      "“Oh my God, I just bottled it. What is going on here? This is a nightmare. They had the street and they were running down it straight into us and people just bottled it straight away.",
      "“There is no disgrace in it whatsoever, you were outnumbered, in the dark, you were ambushed. And they caught us. I just legged it straight down.”",
      "He added: “I didn’t look behind me to see what is going on because this is now your life and you also know you are getting robbed, you are getting slashed, you are getting beat up, you are getting done in, there is no mercy here. They were out to get you and they were everywhere. I just kept running and didn’t look back. It is every man for himself.”",
      "Asked to elaborate on Stanley knives being present, he added: “Everyone was up for a fight, that’s what was happening up and down the country. But these took it to a different level and that was what you were fearful of.”",
      "Running for his life, Tony said bricks rained down on him, and at one point his shoe fell off, forcing him to kneel down while his two pals sprinted away.",
      "He described being “so relieved” to get back to Lime Station unharmed, calling it the longest run of his life. “I got away with my life, and I mean got away with my life,” he said.",
      "Speaking about the atmosphere on the train back, he said: “We were all made up. This is the blueprint of how we are going to go to Liverpool or Everton in the future. We knew we could take it to them - it just needed a little more organising.”",
      "Tony, now the author of Red Army General and The Men in Black, then said within 18 months to two years, Manchester United became the main firm in the country. The former hardman now lives a very different life, and in 2017, he started working at Gary Neville’s and Ryan Giggs’ Hotel Football.",
      "He was handpicked by Neville to work security and speaking about his role, he once said: “I’ve stopped going to games. Me and my wife Debbie do the rooftop at Hotel Football on a match day.",
      "“The whole idea is to make it about the supporters’ clubs. The Hotel is a four-star, but the intention of the hotel was to be where the fans could mix.",
      "“The whole idea was to make it accessible, near Old Trafford, for the fans. I get the supporters clubs in. I get the right people in. People love to mix and see proper United fans.”"

      "Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur will be the two teams to fight it out to lift the trophy. United won this competition in 2017, while the last time Tottenham lifted a European trophy was 1984.",
      "The Red Devils scuppered Athletic Bilbao's hopes of playing a final in their own stadium at the semi-final stage. Ruben Amorim's side won 3-0 in the first leg in Spain, before claiming a 4-1 victory in the second leg at Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "Spurs meanwhile avoided the embarrassment of losing to Norwegian minnows Bodo/Glimt, following up a 3-1 in the first leg with a 2-0 victory in the return fixture on Thursday night.",
      "That set the stage for an all-Premier League final, to be held on 18 May. But given the supporter base of the two clubs, concerns had been raised over whether Bilbao would be big enough to host the final.",
      "According to the Independent, UEFA have rubbished those concerns and there is 'no chance' of the final being moved to an English venue. The San Mames has an official capacity of 53,289.",
      "Demand for tickets from the two finalists' supporters will be far higher than what both teams will be allocated. Both United and Spurs will have an allocation of 15,000 tickets, with a further 11,000 up for general sale and the remainder ringfenced for hospitality and sponsors.",
      "Previous all-English European finals have all been played at their original hosts, including Chelsea's Champions League win over Manchester City in 2021 (Porto), Liverpool's defeat of Spurs in the same competition in 2019 (Madrid) and the Blues' win over Arsenal in the Europa League in 2019 (Baku).",
      "Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou is keen to take on United. He said: \"It's going to upset a lot of people isn't it. The debate's now raging. The latest one is that neither of us will be able to get a trophy if we win, they're just going to take a team photo because we're not worthy.",

      "It has been easy to pick apart Manchester United's recruitment mistakes in recent years, but occasionally, they get things right. As Ruben Amorim plots his Old Trafford rebuild, he has at least a couple of players who can signpost a brighter future.",
      "Despite their success in the Europa League this season, United's route back to the top is not easy. Their base camp is 15th after a desperate domestic season. Yet there are signs of promise and hope for years to come.",
      "Academy graduates Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho offer that. The pair of 20-year-olds have had mixed success under Amorim so far and might see their futures in the spotlight again this summer, but they have the talent to be part of the team, even if both are adapting to new roles in a system they are not accustomed to.",
      "It would be a shame and quite probably a mistake if United opted to cash in on either player. They are two sellable assets at a time when they need to raise funds, and they would be booked as pure profit under PSR rules. Both might not be in Amorim's strongest XI at the start of next season, but they should have roles to play in the future.",
      "Two young players whose immediate futures are absolutely guaranteed are Amad, 22, and Leny Yoro, 19. United paid fees for both as teenagers, but the combined outlay of £96million is beginning to look like a steal as they continue their trajectories.",
      "The path was bumpy for Amad after his £37million move from Atalanta, and there have been times when the initial £19million fee, with a further £18million in add-ons, looked like a waste. But the attacker never gave up. A successful loan spell at Sunderland unlocked his potential, and his rise in the last 12 months has been stratospheric.",
      "He might have been battling Bruno Fernandes for player of the year awards without his recent three-month layoff, but coming on as a second-half substitute against Athletic Bilbao, he showed that the injury hasn't slowed him down. He turned the game with his directness and dribbling ability and must start the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The image of Amad, on his own and surrounded by four defenders in blue shirts, was reminiscent of the famous picture of Diego Maradona in an Argentina shirt facing up to six Belgian defenders.",
      "That's not to compare them as talents, but Amad's work on the ball has the capacity to attract defenders towards him, which can be priceless in opening up space for others.",
      "The question at the moment is whether the Ivorian ends up as a wing-back or as a No. 10 in Amorim's system. In the short term he might be pressed into action on the right, but it has looked recently like Amorim wants him as one of his attacking midfielders, and you can see why that would be the case. He should be a fixture in this team for years to come.",
      "That can be said for Yoro as well, an initial £52million signing from Lille last summer. United beat Real Madrid to his signature, but he suffered a foot injury in his second pre-season game and wasn't fit to start until December, by which time the manager who signed him had gone, and he was being asked to play in a back three system that was unfamiliar to him.",
      "He is now starting to show why many observers consider him the best young centre-back in Europe, and those comparisons with Rio Ferdinand don't look so fanciful. His defending is assured but with obvious room for improvement given his tender age in that position, but his grace in position is particularly eye-catching.",
      "Yoro is starting to show more confidence in carrying the ball forward, which is a vital skill in a wide centre-back role in a back three. He is becoming more of a fixture in the final third.",
      "He set Mason Mount's first goal up against Athletic, and that unpredictability can be a major weapon in United's system.",
      "There are certainly areas where this squad can be improved, and there are plenty of examples of where money has been wasted. But in Amad and Yoro, United have two players who look like generational talents and two players who can form a major part of a successful team under Amorim."

      "Speaking to the media ahead of the quarter-final tie against Lyon, Ruben Amorim confirmed: \"He is out for the season. He will not play again this season, let's prepare him for the next one.",

When asked about his recovery and told to rest up, the Dutchman appeared to tell Davies that it would be 'difficult but not impossible' to return in Bilbao.",
      "Davies and Zirkzee became friends during their time together at Bayern Munich. The pair played together on 16 occasions before a couple of loan spells at Parma and Anderlecht convinced the forward to join Bologna permanently in 2022.",
      "It has been a difficult first season for Zirkzee in the Premier League. However, after reaching his lowest spot at Old Trafford when he was jeered off the pitch having been substituted against Newcastle in the first-half, the forward managed to regroup in a different role.",
      "Amorim began using Zirkzee in the No.10 position where he had more of an impact on the game. While his optimism to return for the Europa League final is admired, it is unlikely that he would start even if he was fit enough to make the squad considering the slow approach United have used towards Amad's return."

      "If United can land both players early in the window, it will be a major foundation to build the rest of their transfer business on.",
      "Failing that, it is no secret that Amorim is a huge fan of Sporting CP forward Viktor Gyokeres having helped the Swedish international develop into one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe.",
      "Amorim signed Gyokeres from Championship side Coventry City in 2023 and the 26-year-old scored 43 goals under his management last season. Gyokeres has kicked on again this term and already has 52 goals across all competitions.",
      "He won't come cheap - at least £85million may be needed to prise him from Lisbon - but he almost guarantees goals and is already familiar with how Amorim operates.",
      "The challenge will be convincing Gyokeres his future is best served at United rather than the likes of Arsenal who have also been linked with the former Brighton youngster.",
      "United's goalkeeping situation is one to watch this summer.",

      "If United have a clear run at signing Cunha then it shouldn't become an issue. However, if the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle reignite their previous interest in the 25-year-old, and can offer him Champions League football, it will make life difficult for United if they fail to beat Spurs in Bilbao.",
      "Not only in the case of Cunha, but Delap has many suitors because of his relatively cheap £30m price tag. And it will apply to whoever else United target in the summer, too.",

      "Unlike Premier League rivals Arsenal, Manchester United are yet to agree any deals ahead of the summer transfer window, but that hasn't stopped them from putting in the groundwork on a number of deals.",
      "Following a disastrous campaign, which could still be rescued by winning the Europa League, United are heading into their biggest transfer window in recent years. Done right, United could be on the path to being back. Done wrong and the vicious cycle that has kept them back for so long continues.",
      "In reality, every area of Ruben Amorim's squad could do with improvements. Andre Onana is clearly not the Portuguese's first-choice goalkeeper, the defence will need attention with Victor Lindelof departing, Casemiro's recent resurgence shouldn't cover over the cracks in midfield and the less said about the attack the better.",
      "\"It's crucial. I think we are trying to do everything as soon as possible,\" Amorim answered when asked how important the summer is. \"I think it's clear for everybody here that is going to be crucial and we have to take advantage of that.",
      "\"We need to do everything soon as possible to be prepared for having everybody for the pre-season to start after a season like this. We need to show something. That is not a debate. So I don't want that conversation of... 'we need a lot of time'.",
      "\"We need time, maybe to win the league, but we need to improve a lot after this season.\"",
      "United have to simply do more than just the bare minimum this summer. Since the start of April, United's transfer rumour mill has gathered pace by the day with over 100 players linked with moves to Old Trafford.",
      "What has become clear is their apparent desire to give Amorim a new centre-forward. As mentioned at the head of this article, the less said about United's attack, the better. Rasmus Hojlund, a £72million signing, has scored four Premier League goals this season, 70 players, including Darwin Nunez, Jordan Ayew, Marcus Rashford, Mikel Merino, Omar Marmoush - who arrived in January - Phil Foden and Jhon Duran - who left England in January - have all outscored him.",
      "A striker is simply the priority. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap is understood to be the number one target with his £30m release clause appealing following their relegation. There is also the curious case of Viktor Gyokeres, who is reportedly open to reuniting with Amorim should United qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Matheus Cunha, who can play as a number nine or attacking midfielder, is a player who seems closer to completing a move than others. Despite countless outlets reporting a fortnight ago that he had agreed personal terms, Arsenal are now said to be doing their best to hijack the deal. Again, if United can get the Wolves star, they'll already be in a better place.",
      "Even with the Brazilian's arrival, United have to push through with their pursuit for a new centre-forward. Whether that's Delap, Gyokeres or even Victor Osimhen, they have to sign a goal-driven centre-forward early in the window.",
      "Elsewhere, United could also do with strengthening the midfield. Manuel Ugarte has made the position his own in recent months and Casemiro has done an excellent job alongside his South American compatriot, but at 33, he still needs replacing.",
      "Ederson is a personal favourite of mine to come in and boost United's midfield. His €40m (£33.8m) release clause in Atalanta is an attractive figure and he suits United perfectly. Given that there is a genuine possibility that he will leave Italy this summer, United should be all over it.",
      "But recently, a shock link to Sandro Tonali has emerged. Reports in Italy have claimed that United are ready to test the waters with a £85m offer for the Italy international, something that seems incredibly unlikely to see the time of day with Newcastle not expected to let their star man leave.",
      "A new centre-forward and midfielder are the priority deals for United but someone to improve the line behind the striker is as important. If they get their business in order, then considerations can be made in other positions.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro both arrived last summer and have been superb signings. However, Amorim's back three means United need five options at centre-backs and Lindelof's exit opens the door for a replacement to recruit.",
      "This, for Amorim, is as important as improving the attack. Football is won in both boxes, as Mikel Arteta has been so keen on expressing, and there's no point bagging goals for fun if you're leaking goals at the other end."

      "Amad's impact before and after an ankle injury that sidelined him for two-and-a-half months suggests he will make the cut but Amorim has a delicate balancing act to juggle. He picked eight defensive players in both semi-final legs against Athletic Bilbao and named an unchanged team on Thursday evening.",
      "These are the key selection dilemmas the United head coach has:",
      "Nobody has played more games for United this season than Alejandro Garnacho (55) and the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao was his 14th successive start. However, his place has come under threat with the return of Amad and the number seven shirt not weighing as heavily on Mason Mount.",
      "Amad has to start the final and has come on to play on the right wing and as the No.10 over the past week. The 22-year-old can adapt to either role effectively and it is more a question of where, rather than if, he will start in Bilbao.",
      "Mount has started in a Champions League and European Championship final (albeit during the fake football of the Covid-19 pandemic) and he has the momentum. Yet he last completed 90 minutes in November 2023.",
      "Leny Yoro has had his best spell for United since the March internationals and Harry Maguire, yet to start a final for the club, is a shoo-in in the back three. The identity of the third could be uncertain until as late as next week.",
      "Victor Lindelof was unconvincing in both legs against Athletic Bilbao and these are his final weeks as a United player. Matthijs de Ligt has one match at Chelsea next Friday to prove his fitness and that could be too late in the day come the final. De Ligt has started only twice in the last six weeks.",
      "Ayden Heaven did individual work at Carrington in midweek but is very much an outside bet, having started only four career games and played 90 minutes once. Luke Shaw is an option but he struggled as a starter at Bournemouth and Brentford and the intensity in the final is bound to be more Premier League than Europa League.",
      "Only four United players have played in at least 50 games this season and Noussair Mazraoui is one of them. He seems assured of a start against Spurs, though Amorim said the Moroccan is currently lacking energy. A conservative role in the back three may be the best use of Mazraoui on May 21.",
      "Amorim is hopeful Diogo Dalot can be available for the final but, like De Ligt, he will have one game at Chelsea to prove his fitness. People at the club have spoken optimistically that Dalot will recover from a calf injury to play again this season and he was at Old Trafford for the Athletic tie.",
      "Amad is a credible alternative and would provide a better balance between defence and attack, otherwise Amorim could overload the starting XI with defensive players again. That sent out the wrong message against Athletic at Old Trafford and United only took them to the cleaners after attack-minded substitutions.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is a non-starter as he will be on the left. Mazraoui's workload could convince Amorim that he is better served in defence.",
      "Denzel Dumfries' excursions against Barcelona in Inter Milan's Champions League semi-final epics are a reminder of the endurance required of a winger in a back-three formation, so Amad or Dalot are the forward-thinking options."

      "From United's perspective, it appears they are in a waiting game to discover if Villa and Rashford can come to an agreement before discussing alternative arrangements for the 27-year-old."

      "Antony has the support of his Manchester United teammates as he continues to thrive on loan at Real Betis.",
      "The Brazilian winger joined United from Dutch side Ajax for a staggering £86m in the summer of 2022. However, the move hasn’t proven to be particularly fruitful, and he joined La Liga side Real Betis on loan during the recent January transfer window.",
      "Despite only being with the Spanish club for a few months, Antony has been a standout performer, recording an impressive eight goals and five assists in 21 appearances across all competitions.",
      "His form has helped Betis qualify for the UEFA Europa Conference League final later this month - having scored in the first leg of the semi-final against Fiorentina, before scoring and assisting in the second leg this week.",
      "Betis will now prepare to face Premier League side Chelsea in the final, which takes place on Wednesday, 28 May at the Stadion Miejski in Wroclaw, Poland.",
      "Following the victory in Italy on Thursday night, Antony shared a post on Instagram with the caption \"BETIS\", followed by a green and white heart emoji. Several of his current, former, and international teammates showed their support by liking the post.",
      "Amad Diallo, Lisandro Martinez, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee were among the United stars to give their approval, while Brazilian teammate Matheus Cunha, who has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, also showed his support.",
      "Antony’s long-term future at United remains unclear, but earlier this week, Real Betis chief executive Ramon Alarcon confirmed the Spanish club would like to extend his loan spell by a further year.",
      "\"Obviously, if someone comes with a very high offer, he's a great player for Manchester [United], and they have the final say,\" Alarcon told El Desmarque. \"But we've always worked with respect.",
      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they’ve seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.",
      "\"If not, we'll have to look for someone else, because the important thing is really to be a team player. If it's not Antony, it will be someone else, but we have to keep competing.\"",
      "However, there’s an acceptance that the final decision lies with United’s hierarchy, and bringing Antony back to the Villamarín Stadium could be difficult if significant offers arrive."

      "After failing to start any of Manchester United's opening 22 Premier League games this season, it was clear Antony had to be offloaded before the end of the January transfer window.",
      "Following several months worth of speculation surrounding his future, the Brazilian international was given an escape route with just over a week of the window remaining, joining Real Betis.",
      "He joined the Spanish outfit on a loan deal until the end of the season, offering him the opportunity to get his career back on track after failing to make his mark at Old Trafford.",
      "Exactly 15 weeks since the deal was completed, Antony has grasped the opportunity with both hands and made the most of it.",
      "His first 21 appearances for Betis have seen him score eight goals and register five assists, meaning his tally of 13 direct goal contributions is only four fewer than what he has produced in 96 appearances for United.",
      "His latest strike in green and white saw him score past former United teammate David de Gea for the second time in a week, with his excellent free-kick on Thursday night helping Betis draw 2-2 with Fiorentina in the second leg of their Europa Conference League semi-final.",
      "After uncharacteristically scoring with his right foot in the first leg, his efforts helped Betis seal a 4-3 aggregate victory. It means they will now face Chelsea in the final at the end of May.",
      "As well as scoring Betis' opener in Italy, he also produced the assist for Abde Ezzalzouli's extra-time equaliser that ultimately sealed the tie in Betis' favour.",
      "Crying during both the full-time celebrations and a post-match interview, Antony said: \"My family knows what we went through to be here.",
      "\"I have cried a lot with my mother, with my wife and with my siblings. Because we went through very tough times. I am living a dream now.\"",
      "The aim of Antony's temporary switch to the Seville-based club was to try and develop a situation that would benefit both him and United. The former Ajax man, who joined the Reds in September 2022 for £86.3million, needed to get out of Old Trafford to get regular minutes under his belt and find the true version of himself.",
      "Scoring seven goals and registering five assists in 21 games, the winger has created a market for himself ahead of this summer's transfer window.",
      "Betis bosses have waxed lyrical about the winger throughout his time at the club and chief executive Ramon Alarcon confirmed in midweek they would like to extend his stay at the club by a further year, but conceded United will hold all the cards on any decision that is made.",
      "\"Obviously, if someone comes with a very high offer, he's a great player for Manchester [United], and they have the final say,\" Alarcon told El Desmarque. \"But we've always worked with respect.",
      "\"Every week, Manu Fajardo, who has done a spectacular job, has sent them the report from the player's week of training, the tactical and physical report from the player's match, and they've seen that we've taken very good care of their asset.",
      "\"We also have to value the player's commitment, as he has 20 days left with the team and is like one of the team members. We'll see when summer arrives if there's an option to bring him in for another year.\"",
      "Signed for £86.3m less than three years ago, it goes without saying that United paid over the odds, meaning they have no chance of recouping a fee anywhere close to what they paid.",
      "United, under profit and sustainability rules [PSR], will have to bank £32.52m to avoid a loss on him. His current form has created a market for him, meaning his stock is much higher than it was in January, but the aforementioned price tag could still put prospective suitors off.",
      "Another loan exit, this time for a full season, could be United's best chance of offloading Antony again this summer. A season-long loan deal with an option to turn it into a permanent deal at the end of it feels as though that could be the most likely type of deal to be struck.",
      "Whatever happens in the summer, Antony deserves credit for making his mark at Betis in the way he has. La Liga is not as physical as the Premier League and his performances have been much more satisfying to watch.",
      "United will have to hold their hands up and accept they misjudged Erik ten Hag's recommendation to bring him to Old Trafford, but they know they have a £32.5m target to keep in mind."

President Steve Bellis has more County years under his belt than most and believes this is the most exciting era of the club’s, and town's, history.",

      "Icelander Andresson swapped playing in the Champions League in his homeland for games like this when he arrived from KR in January. He's moved to the north west alone but his family travel across the North Sea regularly.",
      "The 19-year-old spent two years in Italy with Bologna earlier in his career and is now preparing for the biggest games of his life and dreaming of a potential Wembley final and promotion.",
      "It would also be big for a town that has undergone a transformation in recent years and is in the midst of a £1billion regeneration. Stockport has featured among the best places to live in the country, it's seen a cultural revival with a popular market and clutch of independent business in the old town. There's a new transport interchange that has spawned Viaduct Park and new homes. The band Blossoms, who hail from the town and are named after a town pub, have also helped with their cool image raising Stockport's profile.",
      "The town and football club - lodged in the doldrums of National League North as recently as 2015 following financial issues - have risen together almost hand in hand. That's not lost on County president Bellis who has been involved at the club for more than three decades.",
      "\"I've never been as excited about the future for the club as I am now, I can only see more success,\" he told the MEN. \"Much of the credit has to go the owner for the investment and belief but it is not just about money, it is about doing things the right way and we have retained our DNA. We don't want to lose touch with who we are which is a community focussed football.",
      "\"It is not just great for the club but is great for the town. Both the town and the club are doing great together.

Stockport is definitely on the up and the club is on the up at the same time.\"",
      "The next rung to climb for the club is promotion into the Championship, a division those behind the scenes at Edgeley Park feel is the rightful home and one that offers the dream of the Premier League and the riches that come with it.",
      "\"With the owner and the manager we have got we can really aim high,\" adds Bellis. \"We are in a situation when if we get into the Championship we can sustain and maintain ourselves.",
      "\"We have the infrastructure, we have the size of the town and the dream is we have a golden season and get into the Premier League. That has to be dream but the aim is the Championship.\"",
      "It's the aim for the squad as well. For Andresson it would cap a remarkable story from growing up just outside RRRR in a footballing family and getting within one promotion of the Premier League just four months after arriving at Stockport.",
      "\"Promotion would be amazing,\" he added. \"It would mean so much. Football is so big in Iceland and if you make it abroad then everyone knows you.\"",

That image has since become a viral moment and our Chief Business of Football Writer Dave Powell believes it could be worth up to £308m for the Merseyside club.",

      "However, if it was a stunt planned by United, it has already missed its moment to have a huge financial impact like Liverpool's.",
      "Without going too GCSE Media into the topic, the joy of social media for brands is the ability to share a moment in real time that can ultimately be used to push, in this instance United's, appeal.",
      "If it was planned, there is very little reason to do it so soon after Salah's version. While there is no law against copying a celebration's format, it did come across as a cheap alternative rather than a brilliant moment.",
      "But even if you feel it was right to recreate it on Thursday night, the end product has been a let down. If you go on X at the time of writing, fans are asking the club to publish the footage from the celebration.",
      "As mentioned, this could be impossible if it was a United fan's phone but if they are choosing to withhold the footage for another time, it shows how out of touch this club still is. Ultimately, these matters are not the be all and end all.",
      "But, in an era where United feels like a club that is struggling to fit into the 21st century - this feels like yet more evidence to show that actually, their finger is not on the pulse of what works. And when United need all the money they can get, it is even more disappointing."

      "The Brazilian scored United's second on the night as Ruben Amorim's men cruised to the final of the Europa League with a 4-1 victory, 7-1 on aggregate, success over Athletic Bilbao. Casemiro has undergone a redemption arc this season and while struggles in the Premier League are still prevalent, but admittedly less frequent than last season, it is European football where the midfielder has truly shined.",
      "Casemiro bagged two important goals in both legs of the semi-final and has looked more comfortable under Amorim's coaching. This has led to questions as to whether or not he is playing his way into a contract extension.",
      "His current deal at Old Trafford is due to expire in 2026 and he is believed to be the highest earner at the club on £350,000 per week, according to Capology. There have also been reports that the midfielder's wage could rise to a whopping £500,000 per week next season if United are in the Champions League.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has previously spoken about failing to understand the logic of signing Casemiro considering his age and lack of re-sale value. But, according to Brazilian publication Trivela, a new contract for the midfielder is not being ruled out.",
      "United have the option to extend the Brazilian's stay at Old Trafford until 2027 if they wish and it is claimed that Casemiro is 'waiting for a signal' from the Reds, either way, that this will be activated. Should United wish to let Casemiro leave, they will be hoping to sell him in the summer to recoup some money.",
      "A move to Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr has been heavily touted recently with Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly determined to reunite with his former Real Madrid teammate in the Pro League. However, it is unclear if Al Nassr are willing to pay a transfer fee that United would find acceptable.",
      "United have sought potential bidders for Casemiro over the past 12 months and they would require £15million to sell him and avoid a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United coach Ruben Amorim recently admitted that the Brazilian had changed his mind following his recent good form.",
      "\"I think he has improved a lot also,\" Amorim said. \"You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",

      "\"Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high.

      "West Ham manager Graham Potter has suggested that Ruben Amorim joined Manchester United at a particularly difficult time ahead of their two teams meeting on Sunday in the Premier League.",
      "For Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, it will be a case of seeing what might have been on Sunday after Potter was heavily linked with United last season. In December 2023, reports emerged that Potter and Ratcliffe had met secretly to discuss the possibility of becoming his first head coach appointment.",
      "Sacking Erik ten Hag in the summer appeared to be a formality but winning the FA Cup at Wembley against Manchester City offered the Dutchman a stay of execution. This would last just a few months with Ten Hag being sacked on Halloween.",
      "Speculation as to who would replace Ten Hag was brief as United moved quickly for Amorim with Potter barely in the conversation. Fast forward to January and Julen Lopetegui was sacked by the Hammers and Potter instated as his replacement.",
      "Whether the former Chelsea manager was realistically considered for the United job this season is unclear, but in his pre-match press conference Potter did offer up some insight as to why he may have rejected the role if he was considered. \"We have no idea how Manchester United will approach the game,\" he explained to reporters.",
      "\"It’s a Premier League game at Old Trafford, and it’s always complicated there. So, we have to focus on ourselves, clearly.",
      "\"The only thing we can control is our performance, so we have to go there and try to get the three points. Results-wise, we’re in a difficult moment.",
      "\"So, we want to try and win. And it doesn’t matter about the opponent because we can’t do anything about what they do.",
      "\"I think it was a tough job to go into when he [Amorim] did, with multiple challenges. I think the club is in a position where there’s lots of change, and credit to Manchester United and the supporters there.",
      "\"They’ve supported him through a difficult spell. And, they’re in the [Europa League] final now so, they have a great opportunity to have a fantastic season in the end.\"",
      "Since moving to the London Stadium, Potter has struggled to resurrect a team that has suffered a similarly poor season to United in the top flight. The Englishman has only tasted victory in three of his 16 matches in charge, across all competitions.",
      "West Ham's last victory was on February 27 when they beat Leicester City 2-0. Last time out, they drew 1-1 with United's Europa League final opponents Tottenham Hotspur."

      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "Burnley were shown on the fewest occasions and received £9.3m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",
      "Spurs in 5th (£164.6m) were paid more overall than Villa in 4th (£162.4m), while 8th-placed Manchester United (£156.2m) took home more than 7th-placed Newcastle (£154.7m).",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "“Nobody can deny that Gyokeres hasn’t been one of the hottest strikers in Europe for two seasons now, but he’s been doing it in Portugal. The argument would be that he has scored goals in the Champions League, but there are still doubts about his pedigree in the Premier League.",
      "“Isak, at Newcastle, he was not good at the beginning. He was a good player, but he didn’t have that performance level that he has right now. You need to know if you can give your players time to adapt.",

      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has claimed that his former club ‘must keep’ one player, while he has hit out at Ruben Amorim’s ‘risky sacrifice’.",
      "The 2024/25 campaign has been disastrous for Man Utd as they could still finish 17th in the Premier League, while they have also failed in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "Man Utd‘s run in the Europa League has been their only saving grace as they will qualify for the Champions League if they beat Spurs in the final, but a huge squad overhaul is required with only four players ‘immune’ to this summer’s ‘fire sale’.",
      "Amorim does not have many indispensable players, but Scholes has explained why he ‘must keep’ Bruno Fernandes amid serious interest from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "READ: Arsenal ‘process over’ at ‘fourth tier’ club as Man Utd need ‘cold-blooded’ sale of ‘vanishing’ star",
      "‘He’s involved in nearly everything that Manchester United do well. Sometimes there’s not a lot you can do when there’s such a big demand from the Saudi league, who would pay ridiculous money.",
      "‘It’s quite clear that they need to keep him and build a team around him. It’s just whether they get the option to do that with having money to buy new players and adding space in the squad to bring new players in.",
      "‘With the deals that the club have done in the last few years, it’s going to be very difficult for Amorim to get rid of people.",
      "‘If you get into the Champions League, it’s going to be quite easy to bring people in, but at the same time, you’ve got to get people out and that’s going to be the hardest part of his job.’",
      "Scholes has also explained why he ‘doesn’t agree’ with Amorim ‘sacrificing’ the Premier League for the Europa League, with this decision deemed ‘risky’.",
      "‘Manchester United should be able to play in two or three competitions at once without sacrificing something, and they’ve clearly sacrificed the league,’ Scholes added.",
      "‘I don’t like it and I don’t agree with it and I believe there has to be some sort of standards required in a Premier League team. It’s almost as if they go into Premier League games and there’s an acceptance that they’re not going to win the game, which is madness. I think the acceptance has come from everyone.",
      "‘I think it’s come from the manager even though he won’t admit it. He’s not playing teams to win games of football in the league. I think even fans are thinking let’s get these league games out of the way because the league has been a disaster.",
      "‘They’re probably thinking: ‘Play whoever you want, we don’t care’. There’s an acceptance to it which I think is wrong because the Premier League is your bread and butter. But if you’re going to get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, it’ll all be forgotten, I hope.",
      "‘There is that bad taste in your mouth that the Premier League form is so bad, and they might regret it next year. I think the manager should be using this time to learn how to win games when you’re not playing that well, because it’s going to happen again next year.",
      "‘I don’t think you can just switch a button next season and, all of a sudden, you’re going to see them play brilliantly in the league. I think it’s quite risky sacrificing the Premier League for the sake of Champions League football next year.’",
      "Paul Scholes has hit out at the Manchester United forward for frequently making “wrong decisions” and outlined his “fear” ahead of the summer.",
      "Paul Scholes has picked his winner for the Europa League final after Manchester United and Tottenham set up a titanic battle for the trophy.",
      "Saudi club Al Hilal have reportedly identified Man United captain Bruno Fernandes as their ‘top target’ and have offered him a ‘three-year contract’.",
      "Paul Scholes insists Man Utd were “sloppy” in the second half of their 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night in the Europa League.",
      "Paul Scholes has two concerns over the imminent Man Utd signing and claims nothing can save what has been a “disaster” of a season for the club.",
      "There’s a case for Bruno Fernandes being the Footballer of the Year but it’s an absolutely rotten one."

      "Manchester derby: 0‑0, six yards, free header. He nods wide; nerves ripple through the side.",
      "Last night: clean through, he chooses the fancy chip, watches it drift past the post. The same nervy feeling builds.",
      "The pundit line is that “experience will fix his decision‑making,” as if wisdom drops from the sky the day you turn twenty‑three. Decision‑making is the most instinctive of skills. You can polish it; you rarely remould it.",
      "Yes, he might leave and turn world‑class, as Scholes fears—nothing in football is impossible. But it’s hardly guaranteed. What does feel guaranteed: hand him a chance in a big game and he misses. €60 million? Please and thanks.",

      "Good for you, Mason Mount…\nEven before Mason Mount signed for UTD I used to wonder what exactly he does? He seemed to be a ‘not quite’ player to me. Not quite a no 10, not quite a winger, not quite a midfielder but seemingly also all of the above.",
      "I was a little underwhelmed with his signing, as it seemed to be ‘not quite’ what we needed at the time. Since then the poor guy has been through a really tough time. It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",
      "That is why it was really heartwarming to see him show what he can do yesterday. The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it. I suspect Amorim’s system may reveal exactly what kind of player he is, and that he may end up being a damn good one.\nAkillies, Malawi",

      "Arsenal are not ‘elite’…\nArsenal are a club that every 20 years or so are good, at the moment they are good, but they were never an elite club with the expectation of winning. The shifting financials in football has meant being good doesn’t guarantee you anything anymore, but its usually more fun to be knocking around at the top table than not (despite the impression you get from the more delusional corners of fandom).",
      "There are your truly elite clubs, Real, Barca, Man U (despite themselves), Liverpool, AC Milan, Bayern. They have the history, success, global fanbases, etc. Players will join them based on their name alone.",
      "There is the second tier of clubs, some who bought their way in like Man City & Chelsea who have the modern success but not the long history of glory like the above and the bigger tier clubs from the major leagues, Inter, Juve, Dortmund. PSG are in here, but really need to win something other than League 1.",
      "The third tier are clubs that were once powerful but time has moved on and they are now operating in small leagues, Ajax, Benfica and the like. A team that seeing their jersey makes you nostalgic but you know they will never be back at the top table. Forest and Villa may be dancing around the edges of this group for English football fans of a certain vintage, but they are more sparkling wine than champagne.",
      "The fourth tier is for clubs that do alright every so often, have a bit of success in their own league but don’t stir the juices. This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",
      "The fifth tier is for your sexy teams, Napoli, Marseilles, Bilbao, Fiorentina. They won’t win much but it looks like fun. Tottenham may have a shiny stadium and Brentford may be well run but they just don’t cut it. Celtic probably reside here, not enough European success to be in the third tier.",
      "After that its teams with money, but not enough of it to qualify regularly for Europe, nice for them when they do but a bity meh if you draw them in Europe. A good chunk of the mid ranking teams in the big leagues and the bigger teams from the likes of the Scandinavian league.",

      "Recently its gone past the bile and hatred and in to the downright bizarre as people scratch their heads to try to think of the reasons why they hate Arsenal and Arteta so much without coming to the conclusion that they hate them more now they are a very good team but less so when we weren’t a very good team.",
      "The latest was Arsenal players aren’t ‘manly’ [more on this juicy debate below] they are the types of men who will chat up the secretary despite being married, are not the type of men willing to work hard all their life and die early of a heart attack, and we are being forced to imagine Arteta as Field Marshall Montgomery and what a terrible job he’d have done leading proud Britain in to battle against the Nazi’s, and finally that Arsenal are hated more than the very idea of state funded football teams sportwashing and cheating their way through football? If you’re not an Arsenal fan and Arteta and Arsenal cause you this much rage and causes you to think up these strange analogies and reasons to hate them/him then I think you probably need to step back from the internet, football and re-assess yourself a bit.",
      "There has been a lot of talk of ‘hate watching’ recently, I think its growing massively, particularly with the growth of social media as a pretty toxic environment, it feels no longer is it enough to be happy with what you like, you actually live more for slamming others, getting what you feel is one over them, delight in any perceived failure and the misery of others.",

So yeah, winning trophies is very tough when you arent even in the top 30.",

The process is over, Arsenal will struggle for top 4 over the next few seasons and be back to its mean by 3-4 years easily. Not saying this to troll, but saying this cause this is a very difficult league and this level is impossible to maintain unless you are a serial winner like Pep (With added financial doping) due to 6-8 teams now having the money, power and ambition to be top 4.

      "And please don’t give me any time-travelling hocus-pocus; you can see his face contort with rage and his body language change when he hears the whistle. Then, and only then, he angrily hoofs the ball away, I suppose, because the ref had the temerity to blow up after Trossard so skillfully smashed another player over right in front of him. Your boy was dangerously out of control and fully deserved his exclusion. Using this as an example of referee bias massively undermines your case btw.",

He comes off well, genuinely pleased that the players have come this far. It’s not Al Pacino in ‘Any Given Sunday’ but the team listen, they’re engaged, his voice cuts through. Now, it’s not that deep. Ludicrously well-paid manager addresses incredibly excited team who’ve just gotten to a European final. Table stakes right?",
      "Maybe not. Right from the word go, he’s put all the pressure on himself. Which has made us think he’s an oversensitive grump who can’t handle the pressure. The headlines are always on Ange. Trophy in the second season. People are going to be pissed off I’m not getting sacked. This semi final win is going to upset a lot of people. Nobody has said that much (365 aside) about Solanke (and I hate to say this) not properly delivering on a 65m investment. About world cup winner’s being crap. About Madders going missing. About Son’s form falling off a cliff. Ange has been the patsy. And there’s always a patsy at Spurs. Over the last few years though the slightest whiff of continental egos being cast as the patsy has been met with fireworks. But Ange has played the role.",

      "“They lost 4-3 to Brentford, but until Amorim gets his own team together, it’s too early to judge. I think the top six is still a massive challenge for United next season. They need two or three years with Amorim in charge. They have to stop changing managers.”",
      "Still, the club is moving early to secure what could be their first major incoming of the Amorim era – a dynamic, versatile forward who has been one of the standout attacking players outside the traditional top six this season.",
      "Sources close to the deal, such as transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, indicate United are in advanced talks with Wolves over a move for Matheus Cunha, with negotiations centring around a fee in excess of £50 million.",
      "Waddle, while full of praise for the Brazilian’s ability, was quick to temper the hype.",
      "“Cunha is a fantastic footballer. He can be temperamental, but perhaps United would be the making of him,” he said. “You can’t be mardy at a club like that — the fans will let you know.”",
      "Cunha, 25, has scored 15 Premier League goals this season for Wolves and is widely viewed as ready for a step up. Waddle believes the move could be transformative if the player embraces the pressure.",
      "“He probably thinks he’s at the stage when he should be at a club like United. Wolves are a big club, but Cunha will be looking for another level up.",
      "“He’s got a huge opportunity here. If he’s one of the players to turn United around and [get them] challenging again, he could be like Eric Cantona, the man who changed United.”",
      "It’s a lofty comparison, but one that hints at the scale of hope and expectation surrounding Amorim’s first major recruit.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",

      "Even Matheus Cunha can’t flop at Manchester United… right? He is ridiculously good and Wolves have won six in a row. It’s F365’s 3pm Blackout…",
      "Ruben Amorim hinted that Man Utd are ready to move early in the transfer window, insisting players want to come as he addressed links to Matheus Cunha."

      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Manchester United secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils had a 3-0 lead going into the second leg but it was a tense atmosphere for much of the second leg after Mikel Jauregizar’s first-half strike gave Athletic Club hope of a comeback.",
      "But Amorim rang the changes in the second half and in the end United stormed to a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund both getting on the scoresheet, while Mason Mount scored a brilliant brace.",
      "Mount has endured a nightmare since his £55m move to United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, making just 42 appearances for the club, and doubled his goals tally on Thursday with two outstanding strikes.",
      "The first saw him curl the ball into the far corner after making space for himself in the box with an excellent first touch before he drilled the ball from 40 yards out over the goalkeeper in no-man’s land.",
      "Amorim was delighted for Mount, who he believes is the “perfect” player for the inverted winger role in his 3-4-3 system, but was also impressed by the cameo of Kobbie Mainoo, who’s also not had the best of seasons.",

      "“When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.",
      "“When you have a full squad you can think about the game. Sometimes we’re surviving with people in different positions, but with more options you can change the game and push forwards and these things can help you win games.”",
      "Amad Diallo was also hugely influential having only recently returned from injury, and came off the bench to set up Hojlund’s goal with some wonderful play on the wing.",
      "And Hojlund hailed his teammate for the assist, as well as Mount as another “extremely talented” player.",
      "“Lovely. It was very nice to score a scrappy goal. I am very glad Amad played the ball. What a player. Great player to have back in the team. Them two players are extremely talented, so we are very glad to have them both back [Amad and Mount].”",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has performed an ‘incredible U-turn’ on one Manchester United star who could ‘see out his career’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United should be celebrating reaching a Europa League final, but Ruben Amorim was ‘forced’ to wear a plaster ‘just months’ after getting angry.",
      "Ruben Amorim has responded to Arsene Wenger after the Arsenal legend called for a rule change which would impact Manchester United.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has found it “strange” to watch Ruben Amorim’s side play a different formation to the Under-21 side.",

      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "It’s an inexact science but a glance down the highest-rated Premier League players according to the WhoScored algorithms sees exactly zero new signings feature until No. 33, when we arrive at Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

Turns out he’s not indestructible.",

      "And yet, for all that disparity, any away side has a bit of hope at Old Trafford these days. Bilbao gave it a go. The issue? Finishing. Or lack of it.",

      "It was a brutal 60 seconds for United: Bilbao scored to inject a bit of tension, and at the same time, £80million flop Antony was bending in a free-kick for Real Betis. Manchester United players getting good again the second they leave Old Trafford’s orbit will never not be funny.",
      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund thought he’d rounded it off with a tap-in, but the cherry was reserved for Mount’s second – and third in two games – a left-footed effort from somewhere near Salford. Listen, fair play.",
      "Amorim’s subs did the damage. Mount bagged a brace. Amad Diallo set up Hojlund. Kobbie Mainoo squeezed in two take-ons in just 11 minutes. Lovely job.",
      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",
      "",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",

      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",

      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",

      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Arsenal's target at the start of the season was to win the Premier League. They would have also been hoping to improve on last season's run to quarter finals of the Champions League and potentially go on and taste success for the first time in that competition.",
      "The Gunners wanted silverware. Mikel Arteta wanted to win.",
      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",

      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",

      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",
      "England will indeed have six spots in the Champions League next year, with one of United and Spurs guaranteed to qualify through winning the Europa League.",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",

      "Not having a Champions League campaign - and at least eight league-phase matches to negotiate - wouldn't be a bad thing.",

      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",
      "Just look what it did for Chelsea in 2016/17.",
      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",

      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",

      "Casemiro's looping header turned it around on the night before another brilliant Amad run laid a goal on a plate for Hojlund. Mount had the final say, finishing beautifully from distance with his weaker left foot after a poor clearance by the Athletic goalkeeper.",
      "It capped a special night at Old Trafford, yet another one for them in this competition. Even in these troubled times for United, the trophies have kept coming. Last season, it was the FA Cup. Now, they are just one game away from European silverware in Bilbao.",

      "Marco Silva has got the maximum out of this squad but they've left so many points on the table against the lesser teams in the Premier League. They've won just four of their 13 games against teams in the bottom seven, which makes them easy to swerve here at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "When it comes to the reliability factor, Everton aren't great shakes either, racking up a Premier League high of 15 draws this season. The record for draws in a 38-game season is 17 and they may take one step closer to that in this one.",
      "No Premier League team has won more away points (19) or scored more away goals (18) than Brentford in 2025.",
      "Thomas Frank's side are brimming with confidence and cohesion, and have only lost on one of their last nine Premier League away days.",
      "This is an obvious opportunity for them to stretch that run further and keep up hope of an eighth-place finish, which would be enough for a Conference League spot if Manchester City win the FA Cup. Can they be trusted at such short odds at 4/6 with Sky Bet?",
      "I'd rather play a bigger price and just back Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo both to record a goal or an assist, where you can get 11/8 with Sky Bet. If you calculate their goal involvements this season then Mbeumo and Wissa have 45 between them. A phenomenal record.",
      "If Southampton can only generate 0.5 worth of expected goals and allow Leicester to beat them to nil then what chance have they got facing a footballing machine like City? Saints remain the lowest scorers in the English leagues with just 25 goals, and City's defence has developed a snarl in recent weeks. It's much more secure, with the Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol axis impressing.",
      "Man City to win to nil is 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "The player-to-be-fouled market offered by Sky Bet is quickly becoming one of my favourite markets. There is lots of value to be had there if you can find the right match-up or latch onto a developing fouls trend in the market that has gone unnoticed by the traders.",
      "The player on my radar here is Brighton centre-back Jan Paul van Hecke. He's been fouled 15 times in his last nine starts and has been fouled in every single one of those games.",
      "So those backing him to be fouled one or more times in the last nine games have landed nine winners - a 100 per cent strike rate. His fouls lines are extra juicy here based on his direct opponent in Jorgen Strand Larsen, as the centre forward is a big fouls-committed merchant, making 19 in his last eight games.",
      "Van Hecke is 13/8 with Sky Bet to be fouled two or more times.",
      "Bournemouth have won just one of their last six Premier League home games and the underlying numbers have followed suit in terms of decline. Over the first nine home games this season, their expected-goals data was working at 1.96 per 90, but over the last six, it's down to 1.29. Meanwhile, their expected-goals-against data has taken a whack too. That's gone from 0.9 per 90 to 1.68 per 90 in the last six home games.",
      "The blueprint to stop Bournemouth is something Unai Emery has been implementing against Andoni raola before Iraola-ball was even a thing in the UK - since the Villa boss was manager of Villarreal, in fact. He knows exactly how Bournemouth are going to set up and he's going to implement his plan to stop them - like he has done in every meeting with Iraola before.",
      "Emery has won three and drawn two of the five meetings between the pair. He can lead Villa to an important win at 17/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season. A huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion.",
      "He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",
      "He's in the shop window too, isn't he? Strikers don't come more motivated when trying to play for a next contract so he's going to be doing his upmost to grab the limelight.",
      "\"Who cares if we've struggled in the league?\" beamed Ange Postecoglou after going to the Arctic Circle and getting the job done in impressive fashion on Thursday night. Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at PSG.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",
      "P+L = +8.97"

      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",

      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim claims his team could be the worst Premier League side to lift a European trophy; United face Athletic Club in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday and hold a 3-0 lead",
      "Thursday 8 May 2025 21:02, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
      "They join long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines.",
      "Garancho says he is \"happy\" at the club amid interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",
      "\"As a footballer, you will hear rumours about the future,\" he said. \"I am contracted until 2028, and I am happy here.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Daily Mail report this week claimed Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could be the target for a big-money offer from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "The Portugal international's representatives reportedly held talks with Al Hilal on Monday after initial contact between the two camps last year before Fernandes signed his new Old Trafford deal until the summer of 2027, which has an option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""
