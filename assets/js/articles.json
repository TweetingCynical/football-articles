      "Roy Keane admits Scott McTominay's time at Manchester United was \"tarnished a little bit\" by his constant association with Fred prior to his exit. The Scot left Old Trafford in the summer - a move which has greatly backfired on the Red Devils.",
      "McTominay came through the ranks in Manchester but played in a side that often struggled for consistency. The bulk of his football came under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who regularly paired him with Fred at the base of midfield.",
      "That combination copped criticism with some claiming United needed more star quality in that area. The pair were conveniently named McFred and were viewed as a safe option by Solskjaer, but it appeared to hold back the Scottish star from unlocking his potential.",
      "McTominay was sold in the summer, partly for PSR reasons as United toed the line financially, but the decision has looked a shocker with the 28-year-old excelling for Napoli en route to a possible Serie A title in his first year in Italy.",
      "The ex-United man has scored 12 times in Naples, where he's become a fan favourite, and Keane concedes that his link-up with Fred didn't aid him in Manchester.",
      "The Irishman said on Stick to Football : \"What didn’t help Scott was it was him and Fred together. It just wasn’t a good combo. I know Ole praises both of them – which is beyond me – I always thought there was something in Scott. He had more than Fred going on, but as a partnership it didn’t work, it wasn’t happening, United weren’t competing in midfield.",
      "\"It tarnished him a little bit, 'McFred' wasn’t it. He’s added to his game, to be fair to him. He’s always had a goal in him but he’s got that up to another level. If he wasn’t scoring the goals at Napoli we wouldn’t be talking about him. But you can’t keep talking about players who leave a big club and say we should have kept them.",
      "\"You can’t keep everyone. I think McTominay could have been in the group, 100%. But playing every week? I’m talking about the players you need to get Man United back to the top. They haven’t brought in better which is the problem for the club. United’s recruitment has been that poor that you still talk about former players.\"",
      "Solskjaer, now back in management with Besiktas, has recently confessed he was stunned to see the Manchester outfit part ways with McTominay. It was a decision taken under Erik ten Hag's tenure but the Norwegian claimed: \"How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\""

      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents, he said: \"I had a mad virus. I thought lights were out at some point, I thought it was gonna happen. I thought I was minutes away from lights out, seriously. I was in my house, I was in my bed like this [pained expression] and I couldn't even open my eyes.",

      "\"Then, I was being sick, projectile vomiting in the toilet, I got back to bed and I was having vertigo. I was holding onto the sheets, I didn't know where I was. It was crazy.\"",
      "He added: \"I had to go to hospital and the doctor even said to me, \"Do you want an ambulance\"? So that's when I knew. He went, 'We're going to get your brain scanned'. I thought it was a virus or a flu or something so when he mentioned brain scan and the ambulance, the panic was nuts.",
      "\"I went to hospital and I was in there for a few days. I couldn't even enjoy the hospital food. The soup and the ice cream normally does wonders.\"",
      "Ferdinand now appears to be back to top form having returned to his self-named podcast. He also looks likely to return to punditry duty sooner rather than later, with his former side Manchester United set to take on Premier League rivals Tottenham in the Europa League later this month.",
      "Even during his off-screen time, Ferdinand still offered his take on the weekend's Premier League action. He publicly slammed Liverpool fans for their boos targeted at Trent Alexander-Arnold during Sunday's draw with Arsenal.",
      "He wrote: \"I can’t believe @LFC fans booing one of their own. I understand that some of you guys are not happy with his decision etc BUT to boo @TrentAA after he has won the lot with you is baffling! Didn’t cost you a penny.\""

      "But even if United manage to see off Spurs and secure the Europa League title, it appears that their celebrations will be more of a lowkey affair. According to The Times, there will be no open-top bus parade through the streets of Manchester, with a barbecue instead planned at United’s Carrington training facility should they be victorious.",
      "Plans for post-final celebrations have to be put in place by clubs in advance and United’s scheduling has proven difficult to organise a city-wide parade. United take on Aston Villa at Old Trafford in their final league game of the season just days after the final.",
      "They will then jet off to Asia for a post-season tour with a game in Kuala Lumpur scheduled for May 28, before another clash two days later. Players are then expected to report for international duty straight away, meaning the chance of a parade is remote.",
      "Instead, a lowkey affair will be held at Carrington for players, staff and families to celebrate. Spurs, however, are expected to hold a parade should they clinch the Europa League trophy.",
      "United have not hosted a parade since 2013 and Sir Alex Ferguson’s last Premier League title success. Since then, they have won the Europa League, the League Cup and two FA Cups. And while victory in Bilbao would provide some welcome respite towards the end of a calamitous campaign, United boss Ruben Amorim insists a trophy will not salvage the season.",
      "“Everybody knows it’s really important for our season [but] we know nothing is going to save our season,” he said. “This can be huge, winning a trophy, getting in the Champions League to play European [elite level] games next year: [it] could change a lot of things in our club in the summer. [But] it’s not the most important thing.",
      "Who will win the Europa League? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“Of course people are going to look in a different way for this season, especially at the coach. But it’s something more in the core of our club [that requires addressing].",
      "“We need to change a lot of things and need to be consistent. Europa League will not change our problems – it’s going to give us Champions League next year, more money to spend, but the problems are still there.",
      "“We have to change the minds of our fans with consistency, good decisions, good recruitment, good academy. This is what we need to change to take our club back to the top. This [winning the Europa League] is more of a shortcut to go to the European Cup games. Nothing more. The problems we need to solve in a different way with more time and we’re really clear on that.”"

      "“First off, I’m really embarrassed, in 25 games to win just six. Something is wrong in the way we play football,” he admitted.",
      "“Sometimes it’s not about the way we play…tactically or technically, it is the way we face competition, the way we suffer, the way we get mad because we are losing. These things we need to improve.",
      "“It’s not just inside the pitch, it’s outside the pitch. That feeling I’m talking about - to fight until the end, the way we face competition. It’s not OK to lose, it’s not OK to draw.",
      "“That feeling is not about confidence, it’s about the belief and understanding that we are Manchester United. We don’t want to be the worst in the league and our position is unacceptable.”",
      "Amorim added: “For me that is not about a lack of confidence. It’s something more profound.",
      "“I spoke with the board, with everybody - even the fans in every moment. I have a clear feeling I know what this team needs to be so much better. That helps me to maintain that level, not get so low or too high.”",
      "He cut a significantly more negative figure in his press conference after losing to the Hammers, where he hinted that he could need replacing next season.",
      "He said: \"I don't want to talk about the players. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. I have that feeling.",
      "“We need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave. Because we cannot have a season like this next year. If the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.",
      "\"So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that.”"

      "Obi meanwhile has been looking to take advantage of the issues United have in the final third. Several of the main forwards are struggling for form and the teenager has been given opportunities off the bench, but the Red Devils boss has urged him to keep his feet on the ground.",
      "\"He’s just told me to be humble and keep working hard every day,” Obi said on Amorim's advice. “And hopefully, I get more opportunities soon. My Dad and my Mum always told me to be a good person and listen to my coaches because they want me to get better, so it’s good.\"",
      "He added: \"I’ve learnt to be smart and to think quicker by training with the first team because the game is quicker compared to Academy football. It helps me a lot, training with them every day.”"

      "Despite his vast experience and pedigree, the Bundesliga official is renowned for being involved in a match-fixing scandal. In 2005, he accepted a £250 bribe from fellow referee Robert Hoyzer.

Zwayer has taken charge of over 685 top-level matches, one of those being a controversial Bundesliga clash between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in 2021.",

      "Danny Murphy has criticised Ruben Amorim for his consistent negative attitude towards Manchester United. The ex-Liverpool midfielder believes the current United boss should be thinking with a \"bit more positivity\" and looking ahead to their Europa League final, instead of dwelling on poor results.",
      "Results matches haven't exactly been the best way to exude forward-thinking at Old Trafford, with United's last Premier League win coming way back in March, with a 3-0 victory over now-relegated Leicester City.",
      "Europe aside, the Red Devils are in dreadful form in recent history, just two places above the relegation zone and with the club about to land their lowest ever Premier League finish.",
      "However, Murphy believes that Amorim could have a better attitude when talking about his team, especially considering their exploits outside of the league.",
      "Speaking on Match of the Day, the ex-England international said: \"I'm not a big fan of a manager continually and consistently talking negatively about how bad things are and how bad it is, how we're the worst team, worst United team in the Premier League etc.",
      "\"I'd like to hear a bit more solution-based answers and a bit more positivity and moving forward and thinking forward.\"",
      "These comments from Murphy come after Amorim admitted he may have to step aside at Old Trafford if form doesn't improve by next season. Post-match, the 40-year-old said: \"Everybody here has to think seriously about a lot of things",
      "\"Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not the issue. We have bigger things to think about. I'm talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. We need to change that.",

      "Co-host Mark Chapman then directed the attention to United's latest statistics, as he said: \"When you look at that, it's a bit difficult to be positive isn't it?\"",
      "Prior to Erik ten Hag's dismissal from Old Trafford, he had only suffered two home defeats all season. These were 3-0 losses to current champions Liverpool and fellow Europa League finalists Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Meanwhile, under Amorim, United have faced home defeats against Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle United, Brighton and Hove Albion, Crystal Palace, Wolves and most recently, West Ham United.",
      "Despite this, Murphy was adamant that the Portuguese boss has not faced a lot of criticism during his time, and believes his attitude must change soon.",
      "He said: \"Well, I'm not talking unrealistically, but well, just, you know, they have got a final to look forward to. They could be Champions League [next season], he's got a, hopefully, got a summer of a lot of activity in the window to bring in some of his own players and start moulding his own team if you like.",
      "\"They've only had one signing since he's been there, so he's not faced a lot of criticism, I don't think, considering how bad they've been.",
      "\"So yeah, I've always felt that the leader of the clubs I was at and the managers there, if they're putting on a nice, positive front and trying to be forthright and looking forward, then it'll help the players, rather than constant negativity.\"",

      "The problem for Amorim and his players is that there is no hiding place at arguably the world's biggest club, where the focus and scrutiny is unparalleled, whether the team is racking up trophies or grubbing around near the bottom of the Premier League.",

      "But Ratcliffe and his cronies pressured him into leaving mid-season and are now suffering the consequences of rushing Amorim into leaving against his instincts, with United now worse off than when they sacked Erik ten Hag last October.",
      "When Ten Hag went, United were seven points off the top four. Now, after just six wins from 25 league games under Amorim, they are 26 points off the top four, two places above the relegation zone.",
      "United are at their lowest ebb since they were relegated half a century ago, led by a manager who has questioned his decision to take the job, ahead of a final he is not sure is worth winning. The fallen giants have truly hit rock bottom and it is hard to see a way back to the glory days of the past any time soon. Just ask Amorim."

      "Bruno Fernandes insists that preparations for the upcoming Europa League final are not to blame for Manchester United's latest Premier League no show after the Red Devils slumped to a chastening 2-0 loss at home to West Ham.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side recorded a second straight triumph over Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night to book a date with Tottenham in the Europa League final later this month. They were unable to follow that up on Sunday, though, instead falling to a 17th league defeat of the season.",
      "With United already consigned to a record low Premier League finish, the Europa League represents a shot of salvaging a sorry season. As such, Amorim made six changes to the team that beat Bilbao at Old Trafford in midweek.",
      "However, Fernandes was having none of it when he was asked if said changes to the team and balancing the workload at the end of the season had made things more difficult.",
      "He told MUTV: “No, it can’t make (a) difference because everyone has been training very hard, very well, so everyone is prepared to play at any moment. So, I don’t think that’s the point because I think all the team is prepared for that.",
      "“Every chance and every opportunity is a chance to get into the next 11 and the next 11, and the next 11, so you have to get your chance, you have to get your opportunity.",
      "“It doesn’t matter if you’ve been playing less or more, if you get your chance, if you do things rightly, then you can end up playing.”",
      "“We had two games, we have one more game. We can't just only focus on the Europa League final. We have to put maximum effort on every game,” said the Portugal star ahead of games against Chelsea and Aston Villa.",

      "While Fernandes insisted that the players had no excuses after another poor show, Amorim took full responsibility for United's current plight in a brutally honest post-match press conference.",
      "He said: “It's not the players' fault. It's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast, we should give our place to different persons.”",
      "The former Sporting Lisbon chief added: “I feel how a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed. It’s hard to accept. We need to be more aggressive, and we need to feel that it is the end of the world when we are not winning a game. Especially when we are not winning.",
      "“So it's a big problem that we have here at the club. It's a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to address that. It's a big problem because it's mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don't have that fear anymore and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.”"

      "Manchester United's allocation of their 14,770 tickets for the Europa League final has been questioned by an unhappy fan.",
      "United booked their place in the Europa League final thanks to their win against Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford last week, and supporters have flocked to arrange travel and accommodation.",
      "The Europa League final against Tottenham will be played at the Estadio de San Mames on May 21. United are set to be supported by thousands of Mancunians who plan to make the trip to Bilbao again, but many of those will travel to the Basque Country without a ticket for the game.",
      "Although the Estadio de San Mames has a capacity of just over 53,000 fans, just 29,000 tickets will go to supporters of United and Tottenham and the remaining tickets will be allocated elsewhere by UEFA.",
      "That hasn't gone down well with fans of both clubs, but a loyal and unhappy supporter has also questioned how United has decided to internally allocate their portion of tickets.",
      "Tot Barling, a lifelong United fan now living in Leamington Spa, is facing the prospect of not attending the final, despite travelling to each Europa League away game this season.",
      "Barling has 14 credits as a member, which he estimates puts him in the top 200 or 300 fans for Euro away games, and United's divvying up of final tickets has left him frustrated.",
      "He explained: \"I had to give up my season ticket a while back when I was made redundant and I know people will say going to European aways isn't cheap, but it's for me, what I couldn't pay on a season ticket and it makes my summer holidays. I do Euro aways and sometimes my wife comes with me.",
      "\"If we get cheap travel, sometimes she doesn't, and that's how I've ended up with 14 credits. I've gone to all the European away games this season, but of course, not being a season ticket holder, I don't even get a chance to apply.",
      "\"I know season ticket holders who are bleeping because they're categorised as 'red' and what have you. But my point to the club is, season ticket holders are given privileges, and I was quite happy for every season ticket holder who had one credit from the last three years to be ahead of me.",
      "\"But I still think it's wrong that they offer platinum holders with no credits the chance [to get tickets] ahead of reds with some credits. So there are season ticket holders who are quite rightly miffed.",
      "\"As a member, I'm the lowest of the low, but my point is loyalty to the competition. I get some of the home games for transfers, so unfortunately, those credits aren't in my name, but I've got the 14 credits for the away games, and you saw yesterday that Sir Jim isn't giving 200 tickets to the staff.",
      "\"Well, why not offer those tickets to members who have a massive amount of credits.\"",
      "Barling has contacted United to express his concerns, and a spokesperson from the club said: \"If we are able to offer tickets to members, we will be in touch as soon as possible.\"",
      "The spokesperson also indicated any tickets made available for members would likely be based on 20 credits (six home and six away games this season; and then applying the usual criteria of wider European credits).",
      "Barling continued: \"It's probably the response I expected. My view is that if you don't ask, you don't get. There's always somebody disappointed, I get that, and I understand season ticket holders have priority.",
      "\"But I haven't seen the latest figure of credits. The club normally publish the total number of people on credits prior to a European away and I've got a feeling the cumulative total of those was less than the allocation, hence my point every season ticket holder, whatever colour, with one credit, even if it's back for three years, goes ahead of me no problem.",
      "\"The club keep five per cent of tickets for people with zero credits when there's an allocation of 2,500 or more for [all other] European aways. They recognise people want to get onto the 'loyalty chain'.",
      "\"I can apply for European aways with my membership. I understand they get £40 per year from me as a member, but they still allow me to apply for European aways.",
      "\"So they recognise me as a valid stakeholder when it suits them to sell out European aways, but then when it gets to the final, somebody who is a platinum season ticket holder who hasn't travelled to any could get a ticket.\"",
      "Regarding a practical solution, Barling added: \"I would have given every season ticket holder, no matter what colour, who has a credit, a ticket. Then have sort some of priority.",
      "\"So, do you give tickets to platinum season ticket holders who have never applied, or do you look at members who have applied? My view is that you should give a few to every category.\""

      "\"We need to be really strong in the summer and be brave,\" Ruben Amorim stressed. It would take a brave man not to gut this maligned Manchester United squad.",
      "United's 16th position in the Premier League and 17 defeats are unforgivable, regardless of their Europa League progress. The truest gauge of a team is their league form and United's has not been this appalling since people wore flares and listened to Slade.",
      "Amorim merits backing but, irrespective of whether United return from Bilbao with a new attraction for the club museum, the scrutiny on his position will be intense before each of those first three autumnal international breaks in the first third of next season.",
      "He admitted on Sunday that if the complacent culture continues to linger next season he should be sacked. Amorim has the matchgoers onside, so much so his name is chanted more regularly than any of the players.",
      "United supporters are often dignified in expressing their disapproval. It took a 4-1 humbling by Watford for them to specifically boo Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Vicarage Road. In front of the Sir Elton John Stand, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Separating the head coach from the players signals a vote of confidence for Amorim and a vote of no confidence for the majority of players. Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Leny Yoro are in the good books. All four have been serenaded recently. Amad is a firm fan favourite.",
      "Amad and Fernandes renewed their contracts in the last year, Maguire had his extended until 2026 and Yoro only arrived in July. Casemiro's Europa League pedigree has endeared him to supporters who appreciate his commitment and gutsiness after 18 months in decline.",
      "The purported poster boys of the new United, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, have had trying campaigns and the bond between academy starlets and supporters is not as ardent as it was a year ago. A rejected bid for Garnacho and a rejected contract by Mainoo have doubtless contributed. Both players' agents were sat among the United squad's family and friends in San Mames two weeks ago.",
      "As for the rest, fans would not kick up a fuss if the majority left. United acquired a dependable squad player in Noussair Mazraoui, Ayden Heaven showed promise before injury and Lisandro Martinez is an undeniable asset when fit.",
      "Then there are the frozen assets - those who freeze in the United shirt. Serie A remains a dumping ground for English clubs and United have to write off at least one of the £108.5million misfits Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Hojlund has eked three goals in 32 games and this is his second season. Zirkzee creditably rallied after his ignominious first-half substitution against Newcastle United but United are not going to get to where they aspire to be with him in the team. The two forwards bought from Europe's boot should be given the boot.",
      "Manchester City's dominance under Pep Guardiola was underpinned by them clearing the decks at full back in the summer of 2017. Bacary Sagna, Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy were released while Aleksandar Kolarov was sold. City invested £126.5m to recruit Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo.",
      "By City's sixth game of the 2017-18 season, Walker and Mendy had tallied more assists than Sagna, Zabaleta, Kolarov and Clichy had done between them in the previous campaign. Although Mendy succumbed to an anterior cruciate ligament injury in City's eighth fixture, the die had been cast. Fabian Delph came in as an auxiliary left back and the front-footed approach had a profound effect on serial matchwinning wingers Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane.",
      "Walker is a City great. Mendy is not held in remotely similar esteem for obvious reasons and without him Guardiola reinvented the wheel at left back. Delph and then Oleksandr Zinchenko had successful stints out of position there. City have still not signed a recognisable left back since Mendy.",
      "United, meanwhile, still have a left back who joined 11 years ago. They are saddled with Luke Shaw, approaching the last two years of his contract. Victor Lindelof's outstayed welcome will end after eight years and the United hierarchy must have breathed a sigh of relief when they discovered that there was not a one-year option on Christian Eriksen's contract.",
      "Loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have to be shifted permanently. United may have a similar waiting game with Rashford to last summer's with Sancho, who joined Chelsea at the 11th hour. Europa Conference League finalist Antony is at least creating a market that should ensure his fee prevents United from making a loss on him under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "Casemiro's European form cannot hoodwink United. If they lose to Tottenham in Bilbao, no European football next season would effectively render Casemiro more redundant than some of the staff the club are letting go. The 33-year-old's revival has been restricted to the Europa League.",
      "Should Casemiro stay or go, Amorim would be sanguine. His perception of the Brazilian has altered drastically since the end of the winter transfer window. As instrumental as Casemiro was against Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Bilbao, hardly any clubs would stump up the £15m United require and match Casemiro's handsome £300,000-a-week salary.",
      "Unlike Manuel Ugarte against Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Casemiro is brave, at least."

      "United, in previous years, have developed a reputation for being reckless spenders, paying over the odds for countless players.",
      "However, as was demonstrated in last summer's window, United, under Ineos' governance, are trying to improve their hit rate in the market by not getting bullied into paying inflated prices.",
      "And that is an approach Berrada has already vowed United will follow this summer whether or not their coffers are inflated by the Champions League's attractive financial benefits.",
      "He said: \"I can answer that question in specifics, but ultimately what we want to do is to be more efficient in our investment into the squad.",
      "\"So just because we'll have more revenues to invest if we're in the Champions League, it doesn't mean we're going to go and over-invest. We need to be cautious and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment.",

The report goes on to say that Arsenal haven't made a formal bid yet and are not expected to do so immediately, as Gyokeres is focused on winning the Liga Portugal title and the Taca de Portugal with the Lions.",

      "Ugarte seems to be like Marmite among supporters. Some fans don't think he offers much at all, while others believe he's been a good addition. The truth is probably somewhere in between.",
      "There have been good and bad days for Ugarte in his first season in English football since he signed from Paris Saint-Germain for €50million (£42.3m), with a further €10m (£8.5m) in add-ons.",
      "Ugarte is a mobile No.6, someone who can protect the defensive line by intercepting and recovering balls, but his passing leaves a lot to be desired, and there's a conversation about whether United need another player in his position.",
      "The very fact those conversations have taken place tells you Ugarte's first season hasn't gone as planned because if it had, United would not need a midfielder in that mould this summer.",
      "Last summer, United were reluctant to match PSG's asking price of a €60m (£50.6m) fixed fee for Ugarte, and they believed the deal they eventually agreed vindicated their patient approach to negotiations.",
      "Having said that, that can only be true if the knocked-down £42.3m fee for Ugarte can be considered value after his first season, which is doubtful.",
      "Ugarte has been hit-and-miss, although he certainly isn't the only member of the dressing room who has fallen short of expectations in this campaign.",
      "Every single player, with the exception of Bruno Fernandes and Amad, will end this season with some reputational damage, but it's disappointing that United might already need to sign a player of Ugarte's ilk.",
      "There have been some good displays from Ugarte, particularly alongside Fernandes in the pivot, but Amorim will be unsure whether they are a good enough midfield pairing for next season.",
      "United are targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League next term, so can they achieve that with Ugarte and Fernandes starting the majority of games in the pivot? Perhaps the answer is no.",
      "The club will admit they have been unconvinced about Ugarte, who was still signed for a reasonable sum, despite it being less than PSG's initial asking price, if they look to sign another midfielder this summer.",
      "Performances like Ugarte's against West Ham on Sunday won't help his case, either."

      "The result was United's 17th of a woeful Premier League season and dropped them to 17th in the table. Ruben Amorim's side are now seven without a win in the top fight and have only won one match against a non-relegated club (at Fulham in January) since the dramatic derby day comeback at the Etihad in December.",
      "The numbers make grim reading and while the Europa League final against Tottenham offers a chance at salvation and the prospect of Champions League football next season, United's form in continental competition - where they are unbeaten this term - is only papering over the cracks.",
      "A dramatic rebuild is needed and required but will cost money United don't have. Winning the final in Bilbao next week will earn £10.95million in prizemoney along with the riches of the Champions League.",
      "But United's financial position is worsening by the week in the Premier League. They can finish no higher than 13th but even that looks out of reach for Amorim's side and with the prospect of the boss resting players for Friday's game with Chelsea ahead of the final, United could even drop a place to 17th.",
      "Every league position is worth roughly £3million more than the one below through domestic and international merit payments from the Premier League. The figure is different each year and the 2025 numbers have not been released but last season offers an indicator of just how United will be impacted.",
      "In 2023-24 clubs were awarded £2.8million for each position in the Premier League and United earned £34.7million from finishing eighth. With the same figures used this season, they would earn just £11.3million if they end up 17th or £14million if they finish in 16th.",
      "That's a potentially significant drop of £23.4million in prize money if they finish 17th - or just over £20million should they end where they are now, which will have a direct impact on the summer transfer budget.",
      "Premier League clubs pocketed £2.84billion last season through six payments of the league's ‘central revenue system'. Two of those are based on finishing positions while the others are equal shares and a variable facility fee for hosting live TV games.",

      "Osimhen, who spent this season on loan at Galatasaray following a public falling out with Napoli manager Antonio Conte, is among the players set to depart the club at the end of the season. Osimhen has been linked with a move to Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his attacking options.",
      "This season, both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have struggled to consistently share the goal-scoring burden. The duo have scored just seven goals combined in the Premier League.",
      "Napoli, meanwhile, have already identified Osimhen's replacement - Lille’s Jonathan David, who is set to leave the French club on a free transfer when his contract expires.",
      "As a result, he is attracting interest from several clubs eager to secure his signature. However, Napoli are said to have stolen a march on the competition.",
      "Transfer specialist Fabrizio Romano states that the Italian giants have submitted a proposal to the striker and advanced talks are currently ongoing.",
      "He also adds that 'key' details are yet to be clarified before David makes a decision on his future.",
      "This gives United a chance to land Osimhen, though the club hierarchy will be well aware that he won’t come cheap.",
      "Meanwhile, Dwight Yorke believes signing Osimhen is a 'no-brainer' for his former club.",
      "\"Manchester United signing Victor Osimhen this summer would be better late than never,\" he told Instant Casino. \"I don’t know what has stopped the club signing these big names in recent windows.",
      "\"You can see why they have signed young players for their potential like Rasmus Hojlund, but United need more than that. They have made too many mistakes and are paying for it. Can Osimhen handle the pressure? Well, it can't get any worse. He's been around for a while now, he's a senior player and he's scored wherever he's been.",
      "\"The expectation of coming to Manchester United now, it's something that will give him another challenge to achieve. I think signing Osimhen is a no brainer. I think it's a no-brainer because United are in a hole and they need to get out of it.\"",

      "They are set to play in Kuala Lumpur on May 28, followed by another match in Hong Kong on May 30. After then, the players will need to report straight to international duty - making any potential parade logistically tricky to organise.",

      "United suffered a 17th defeat of the Premier League season against West Ham last weekend. Amorim is aware that winning the Europa League is the only way to salvage the campaign, although United will take on Chelsea on Friday before they play their most important game of the season at the Estadio de San Mamés.",

      "\"I love his honesty. I said [when Evra met Amorim] 'welcome to your club' and he said 'no Patrice, I'm at your club'. I love his personality, but of course, the results have been really bad this season.",
      "\"It's a process. In his first year, I see a lot of improvements. There is discipline. The player who doesn't want to run, who doesn't want to die for the badge, they won't play for Manchester United.",
      "\"He brought in a few players [Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven], but they need time to adapt. Even myself with Vidic when he arrived, we had six months to adapt, so next year won't be an excuse.",

      "It was after Ruben Amorim's third game in charge of Manchester United that he made the decision to warn everyone that a storm was brewing.",
      "United had just beaten Everton 4-0 to secure Amorim his second win from his first three games in charge and a second home win in the space of less than 72 hours.",
      "\"We are going to have difficult moments and we will be found out in some games, I know that,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I know it is really hard to be a Manchester United coach and say these things in press conferences - and we want to win all the time, no matter what - but we know we are in a different point compared to Arsenal [next fixture]. I would like to say different things, but I have to say again, the storm will come.\"",
      "Despite the 4-0 scoreline suggesting United had brushed Everton aside without a moment's hesitation, they had ridden their luck, particularly in the first half, with Everton failing to capitalise on chances that came and went.",
      "Since that victory over the Toffees, handsome scorelines have been at a premium, with United's only other four-goal hauls coming in the Europa League against Real Sociedad (4-1), Lyon (5-4) and most recently Athletic Bilbao (4-1).",
      "In the Premier League, United, since beating Everton on December 1, have scored just 25 goals in their last 23 games, once again shining a light on how indifferent their domestic performances have been in comparison to those that have been served up in the Europa League.",
      "Sunday's 2-0 defeat to West Ham United marked their 17th league defeat of the season and the 14th time they have failed to score in the Premier League this season. It also marked a ninth Old Trafford reverse of the campaign, meaning they have now lost exactly half of their home league games with just one left to play.",
      "United's home form in the Premier League this season has been a significant contributor to their domestic struggles across the board. They have amassed just 21 points from 18 home games this term, winning six, drawing three and losing nine.",
      "They are winless in their last four home league games, losing each of their last two. They have also failed to score in their last three.",
      "Since Amorim officially took charge at United during the November international break, his team has collected just 11 points from a possible 36 on home soil. Only Everton, Southampton and Ipswich Town have walked away from Old Trafford empty handed.",
      "Furthermore, five visiting teams at Old Trafford have recorded victories to nil during that period. The Theatre of Dreams has once again turned into the Theatre of Nightmares.",
      "After United's home record attracted justified criticism in 2020/21 and 2021/22, it was transformed under former manager Erik ten Hag in 2022/23.",
      "After losing 2-1 to Brighton & Hove Albion on the opening day of the Premier League season, United did not taste defeat at home in the league again all season. Sociedad, who visited Old Trafford on the same evening Queen Elizabeth II died, were the only other team to win at Old Trafford that season, and that defeat was played out in unprecedented circumstances.",
      "United won 15 of their 19 Premier League home games in Ten Hag's maiden season in charge, amassing an impressive 48 points - a record that was only bettered by Manchester City's tally of 52.",
      "After a period in which visiting teams came to Old Trafford and were confident of planting their flag in the ground and making a statement, Ten Hag turned M16 back into a fortress, with Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, City and Chelsea all being beaten in 2022/23.",
      "Resurrecting United's home form was the backbone of the success Ten Hag enjoyed in his first season at the club, with it playing a key role in helping them secure a top four finish and reach the Carabao Cup and FA Cup finals.",
      "Amorim has already experienced far too many disappointing afternoons and evenings at Old Trafford, meaning improving United's home record next season has to be a leading objective for him.",
      "A club of United's stature should boast one of the Premier League's best home records season after season. If not, the storm that Amorim said was coming will continue to sweep its way through M16, and the damage could be catastrophic."

It is a far cry from three years ago and chants of ‘You’re not fit to wear the shirt’ and ‘F**k off Pogba’ during an actual win against Norwich City. The away-dayers re-aired the former at Brighton and Brentford that year.",
      "Wolves and West Ham United have done the double over United in successive months at Old Trafford and there was barely a murmur of discontent in the stands. Apathy is rife.",
      "One is not advocating booing or abuse. A new benchmark was set at Selhurst Park last season. That 4-0 drubbing was the seasonal nadir yet the support from the away end at full-time was remarkably, well, supportive. A friend in the Arthur Wait Stand described it as “poignant”.",
      "United supporters will not turn as long as there is glory on the horizon. That Europa League trophy they can see is not a mirage.",
      "Woe betide the players if they return from Bilbao without some extra hand luggage. The only thing more humiliating than finishing 17th and losing a final to Tottenham is relegation.",
      "The atmosphere on the final day against Aston Villa at Old Trafford will either be optimistic or antagonistic. There was more chanting against the Glazers and those now-permanent banners in front of the directors’ box were brandished again on Sunday.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has not been at the stadium since those choreographed protests against his callous treatment of loyal paying supporters began against Wolves on Easter Sunday. A startled security official strode to the front of the directors’ box during the impromptu protest in the first half against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Antipathy towards the owners and the hierarchy is simmering and confirmation of a worst domestic season in 51 years might halt the happy-clappy reactions. United have lost nine times at Old Trafford - as many as when the team was relegated in 1930-31. A tenth against Villa would be unprecedented in a single season.",
      "The supporters' silence spoke volumes on Sunday. There were no boos at half-time or full-time. That is commendable loyalty on a weekend that thousands of histrionic Scousers booed Trent Alexander-Arnold for having the temerity to walk alone.",
      "“It is hard to say something about our fans and everybody,” Ruben Amorim admitted. “There is no explanation, no matter the context. And I‘m talking here, I’m the biggest responsible for that. We need to change a lot of things during the summer.”",
      "Amorim has never been angrier at a post-match press conference. He could be seen gnawing at his knuckles seven minutes after West Ham went 1-0 up.",
      "Those of us present in the press room sensed he would cut loose. It was after a non-televised Sunday afternoon home defeat to Brighton in January that Amorim billed his United as “maybe the worst team in the history of the club”.",
      "The recent four-goal defeats to Newcastle United and Brentford could be dismissed; league fixtures sandwiched between European ties. West Ham was not.",
      "West Ham had not won a match since February 28. They were, at kick-off, the worst team in the top flight bar the three sinking ships plunging into the Championship. Their once placid manager had been so tempestuous in recent press conferences he appeared to be bordering on the brink.",
      "And still Graham Potter was able to motivate West Ham to win at Old Trafford. Amorim was incapable of motivating United’s players to win a first Premier League fixture in seven.",
      "He effectively acknowledged some players pick and choose when to perform. “It’s hard to explain that and that feeling,” he admitted.",
      "“For me, the biggest concern is that feeling it’s okay, we cannot change our position so much so it’s okay. That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it’s the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.”",
      "A colleague singled out Manuel Ugarte. Amorim was reluctant to throw players under the bus. If he was of that persuasion, he would still be in the press room.",
      "Ugarte can cope in the Europa League but barely copes in the Premier League. Rasmus Hojlund curates captions on Instagram more carefully than he strikes the ball. Luke Shaw cannot complete 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo does not know whether he is coming or going. Altay Bayindir wears the number one but is the third-best goalie.",
      "The majority of United’s league losses have been greeted with a shrug of the shoulders. Confirmation of a first bottom-half finish in 35 years against Brentford was not back-page news. Amorim ensured he was the splash on Monday’s editions.",
      "'I'LL HAVE TO GO', warns The Sun. The Mirror went with 'AMBARRASSED'. It was 'SHAMEFUL' on the Express. The Times opted for, 'Amorim: I'll quit if we don't fix this'. He won't quit. He will be sacked.",
      "United’s team against West Ham was stronger than expected. Harry Amass was the sole raw pick. Some starters were signed for £58million, £50m, £60m, £67m, £37m and £72m. United fired blanks for a 14th game this season.",
      "Records continue to tumble with any home United reverse: West Ham won their first league game at Old Trafford since May 2007. Six clubs have done the domestic double over United this season. They have not lost this many league games since they were last relegated.",
      "That is how bad this team is and the players still put their hands together and confidently approached the north-east quadrant at full-time. Old Trafford was half-empty at best and actions speak louder than words.",
      "Amorim pondered whether not winning the Europa League would be a blessing in disguise. United's FA Cup final victory proved to be detrimental in the long run as impressionable and fickle fans forced the decision-makers into a ridiculous U-turn on Erik ten Hag.",
      "Amorim suggested at his first Carrington press conference back in November that it would be fair to judge him after two years. Make that one year. United’s league position is borderline unforgivable. If they are in an identical position this time next year then there will be a different manager in the dugout.",
      "This has been the worst of the Premier League seasons since its inception in 1992, devoid of a title race and jeopardy at the foot of the table. United have won ten out of 36 games and half of them were against the relegated trio. Fulham (twice), Brentford, Everton and Manchester City ought to feel rueful.",
      "Lose in Bilbao and United should not expect to encounter the open arms of forgiving fans in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong on their post-season tour, either. Harry Maguire was booed in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin during pre-season. Ashley Young copped similar flak in Singapore in 2019.",
      "The memory of United fans serenading Anthony Martial after the final home game of last season was a minor but watershed moment. Martial had put his feet up for five months, failed to support Hojlund and ran down his contract yet got a hero's send-off.",
      "Conveniently, Martial returned to team training for the FA Cup final. Ten Hag coldly omitted him from the squad and Martial could not even be bothered to travel to Wembley.",
      "Those were standards."

      "According to old UEFA rules, two clubs under the same control were prevented from competing even in different European competitions. As Sir Jim Ratcliffe holds a stake in both Man United and Ligue 1 outfit Nice, it would have been impossible for the two clubs to both be playing European football.",

If Ratcliffe keeps his stake in both clubs, there is still a way for both to compete, as revealed by a UEFA statement.",

      "As such, all that is really needed will be proof that the two clubs are not run simultaneously and Ratcliffe's desire to sell his Nice stake could certainly help their case if the worst transpired.",
      "Ratcliffe was forced to transfer his shares in Nice into a 'blind trust'. That mean that decision-making in France was solely in control of a trustee. However, those shares are due to be transferred back on July 1 meaning a problem could await Ratcliffe.",

A: the rules are changing, and B: there are shades of grey not black and white. Manchester City will probably have the problem before we have the problem because they’ve obviously got Girona.",

We have an issue and we might have to change some things. But what they do recognise is that the multi-club model in many circumstances benefits the smaller club quite a lot.",

So that’s a good thing. But what they’re worried about is if there’s ever an accusation that somebody influences the result of a game - lack of integrity. That’s the most concerning thing.",
      "\"We’ve never spent time really understanding the benefits of a multi-club. But we’ve got Omar obviously, who’s been intimately involved in a really successful multi-club, which is Manchester City.

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford has sent a message to Lamine Yamal amid speculation linking him with a transfer to Barcelona.",
      "MEN Sport reported that Barca had weighed up a move for Rashford in the January transfer window after it became clear that he was no longer in Ruben Amorim's plans. However, due to their ongoing financial difficulties and their lack of interest in a loan, they did not pursue a deal.",
      "It is believed to be Rashford's dream to play for Barcelona, and when it became clear the Catalan club would not be pursuing their interest formally, a switch to Aston Villa was soon agreed. Unai Emery personally pushed to sign the England international, as he felt he could help him rediscover his form.",
      "While that has been the case somewhat, his momentum was dashed after picking up a hamstring injury which may have ended his season. Rashford has been undertaking hot weather training in Dubai to help improve his chances of returning before the end of the campaign, but that seems unlikely now.",
      "Villa and United agreed to a buy option when the loan was confirmed in the winter. It is understood that the West Midlands club have first refusal on Rashford for a price of £40m.",
      "However, it is not guaranteed that Rashford will move to Villa Park even if Emery's team are willing to pay the asking price. The forward would need to agree personal terms before green lighting a move.",
      "With speculation mounting that Barca could swoop in if Villa don't get an agreement in place, Rashford showed his clear admiration for their current sensation - Yamal. The teenager scored on Sunday as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 4-3 in La Liga.",
      "After the match, the 17-year-old celebrated the victory on social media and included an image of himself meeting Arsenal great Thierry Henry. To the post, Rashford replied: \"Young king.\"",
      "At the time of writing, the comment has garnered more than 64,000 likes. If Rashford were to sign for Barcelona, it is expected that he would play in rotation with Yamal, as his ability to play as a winger and a centre-forward is seen as appealing for the La Liga giants."

      "Imagine how Amorim feels now that another four months have passed. United suffered a 17th defeat of the Premier League season against West Ham and have a goal difference of -11.",
      "Amorim left behind a comfortable life in Portugal for a mammoth job in Manchester, perhaps the extent of which he didn't expect. Amorim didn't enjoy a 'new manager bounce' and abysmal performances in the Premier League have continued to produce shockingly bad results.",
      "West Ham had won just four away games all season until they visited Old Trafford. They last won a league game against Leicester on February 27. \"How s*** must you be, we're winning away,\" their fans sang.",
      "The unwanted records stacked up with Erik ten Hag in charge last season, but more pages of shameful history have been written and the Europa League final is the only glimmer of hope in the darkness.",
      "Amorim even admitted he was \"embarrassed\" of United's situation when he spoke in his post-match press conference. \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position: embarrassed, and it's hard to accept,\" said Amorim about what he was feeling.",
      "\"Everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final, the final is not an issue in this moment in our club, we have bigger things to think and we have to change a lot of things at the end of the season.\"",

      "\"I have that feeling and we need to change that. We need to be really strong in the summer and be brave. We will not have a next season like this if we start like this. If the feeling is still here we should give space to different persons.\"",
      "Amorim said his priority is preparing for Chelsea, however, it has been 'Bilbao or bust' for a few months and the Europa League final will be the game that has a bearing on his future.",
      "Most believe Amorim should be safe regardless of the outcome of the Europa League and backed in the summer window, but the 2025/2026 Premier League season already looks treacherous.",
      "Winning the Europa League at the Estadio de San Mames would salvage the current campaign, although it would not prevent Amorim from immense pressure should United start next season slowly.",
      "That pressure would become something else entirely if Tottenham win the final in Bilbao.",
      "Whichever way the final goes on May 21, Amorim will start the new Premier League campaign knowing he needs to hit the ground running in the league, which will always be the focus.",
      "Ten Hag was in a similar position at the start of the season after winning the FA Cup at Wembley. Then the same problems existed and Ten Hag was finally axed shortly after the October international break.",
      "The October break can be ominous for struggling managers because it's an opportunity to make a change, and there's enough evidence available by then to suggest a change is necessary.",
      "Amorim has aged with the pressure of managing United, but it will increase tenfold next season and he almost certainly will not be in charge if United are in the bottom half of the table by October.",
      "That is the worst-case scenario. Amorim could obviously make an excellent start to the 2025/2026 campaign after signing players who can competently fulfil important roles in his system.",

      "The 1958 have organised several peaceful protests against the Glazer family over the last few years and have been at the forefront of protests again throughout an awful 2024/2025 season.",
      "United fans were recently encouraged by The 1958 to join a sit-in protest after the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on April 6. And the supporters group have now announced a fresh protest, which will take place before United play Aston Villa at home on the final day of the season.",
      "The 1958 have reiterated they want the Glazers \"out\" because \"they were never welcome\", and fans have been asked to join the protest against the American family on May 25.",
      "The press release announcing the protest from The 1958 said: \"May 2005 marked one of the darkest days in the history of Manchester United Football Club. The Glazer family became majority shareholders, triggering a compulsory takeover that was completed on 29th June 2005.",
      "\"That moment signalled the beginning of the end for the soul and community of our once-great club — sacrificed at the altar of corporate greed.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson, a staunch supporter of the Glazers then and now, masked the damage with unprecedented success on the pitch. Since his retirement, the rot beneath has been laid bare for all to see — the true cost of 20 years of financial exploitation and mismanagement.",
      "\"Hundreds of millions have been siphoned off to service that debt — not by the Glazers, but by our club. All while the Glazers continue to pocket dividends, year after year, regardless of failure on the pitch.",
      "\"Old Trafford, once the Theatre of Dreams, is crumbling from decades of neglect. They’ve taken everything.",
      "\"Now, even Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival has come at the cost of hundreds of jobs, further punishing a fanbase already suffering under the Glazers’ reign. Lifelong, loyal supporters are being driven away from the club they love — priced out and pushed aside. Another dagger in the heart of our footballing community.",
      "\"Make no mistake — this is the legacy of the Glazer family: greed, decay, and betrayal. Our final home game of the season is against Aston Villa. We march. As one fanbase. To make it clear: 20 years on, the fire still burns Red — with fury and defiance.",
      "\"We want the Glazers out of our club. They were never welcome. They are not welcome now. They will never be welcome. We protest once again at Villa, more details to follow.\"",
      "United have protested against the American family since their controversial leveraged buyout in 2005, and the pressure has mounted in the last decade amid declining standards at the club.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke to The Times and said he would walk away from United if the protests were sustained against him. \"[Fan protests] can be unpleasant. And I’ve probably failed on the having fun front. I mean, I can put up with it for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don’t mind being unpopular because I get that nobody likes seeing Manchester United down where they are, and nobody likes the decisions we’re having to make at the moment.",

      "\"They can’t really come to a match, the Glazers. They’ve retreated into the shadows a bit now, so I’m getting all the bloody stick. We bought in and I haven’t seen them since.",

      "Ruben Amorim has suggested that he could be sacked at Manchester United next season if their dismal Premier League form continues.",
      "Sunday's 2-0 loss at home to West Ham was their 17th defeat of an atrocious top-flight campaign under the former Sporting boss and his predecessor Erik ten Hag, who was dismissed in October. United have suffered their most defeats in a league campaign since the 1973/74 season when they were relegated.",
      "The one saving grace for Amorim has been the Europa League with his team reaching the final against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao on May 21 (8pm kick-off). Victory in Europe's second-tier competition will secure an unlikely place in next season's Champions League.",
      "But Amorim has not shied away from the wider problems at M16. In a passionate interview, post-match on Sunday, the 40-year-old did not hold back.",
      "When pressed on whether his squad needs an overhaul, he replied: \"I don’t know and I don’t want to talk about players. I’m talking about myself. I’m talking about the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "\"I have that feeling and we need to change that. We need to be really strong in the summer and be brave. We will not have a next season like this if we start like this. If the feeling is still here we should give space to different persons.\"",
      "Amorim has rarely held back in his honest assessments of United. A notable standout was suggesting in January that his side could be the worst Manchester United team in history.",
      "His fairly recent arrival at the club may have afforded him some leeway to make these comments. The Reds are at their lowest ebb, but managers are often afforded more time at Old Trafford than at other clubs.",
      "It's extremely unlikely that Amorim will be sacked this summer, regardless of their final Premier League position or the Europa League final outcome. However, the spotlight will be shone on him if they remain this low going into the Autumn, and that could be fatal for his job prospects at M16.",
      "It speaks to Amorim's character that he would even feel this way.",
      "For too long Man United fans were subjected to Erik ten Hag, who wouldn't accept the truth that his team were playing below standards. Here, Amorim acknowledges the fact and it's refreshing.",
      "But that will only wash this season - once the reset happens for 2025/26, these results must cease. Amorim won't walk away from the task now, surely, even if he is being brutally honest as usual. But he won't be able to hide if the rot continues into next term.",
      "If recent results continue, then Ruben Amorim appears unlikely to bring up a year as Manchester United head coach next November. That is the reality of how poor the team's league form is.",
      "Amorim conceding as much is an honest acknowledgement of the club's current predicament. His accepting of fault is a far cry from when Erik ten Hag was manager, and will potentially afford him greater goodwill for longer.",
      "Making a change this summer would make no sense, regardless of how this season ends. Amorim cannot be allowed to start afresh this summer, but he deserves a pre-season and to be judged on how the team performs afterwards more than on they conclude this campaign.",
      "It's one step forward and three backwards for United and Amorim. After Thursday night and the emotions that came with qualifying for the Europa League final, United were shocking in their own back yard against a poor West Ham team.",
      "The same happened after they beat Lyon, a poor performance against Wolves followed. That comes down to the players but that doesn't mean Amorim is void of any criticism.",
      "But, as has been mentioned, the comments from Amorim are refreshing to hear a manager speak so honestly. The problem is, however, that if United don't fix-up and next season is anywhere near as bad as this, he will be in trouble.",
      "The hierarchy have put their faith in Amorim so his comments will be a concern for them. But, in my view, his honest admission after the West Ham defeat is a message to the board. He needs to be backed and if he isn't, it could be another troubling season.",
      "Welcome to the Manchester United soap opera, Ruben Amorim. This season has been nothing short of a disaster and the Portuguese head coach has taken just 24 points from 25 games - six wins and six draws.",
      "The only reason United haven't been in any serious jeopardy is because the teams below them this season have been woeful. Amorim's honesty, as mentioned above, will likely buy him more time in the dugout and there are plenty of caveats to consider.",
      "He's not been able to invest into his squad, with too many players who are simply not good enough to represent United already at the club when he arrived. As soon as the 2025/26 season starts, any grace period will go out the window and the pressure will really start to ramp up.",
      "Amorim's comments should be hugely concerning for United's owners and if he were to leave early next season, who in their right mind is going to want to touch the job?",
      "I'm surprised Ruben Amorim took the job in the first place! Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers should be grateful that a manager of his pedigree was willing to risk his reputation to coach Manchester United.",
      "The club has been a mess for a while now. If Ratcliffe and the Glazers don't give Amorim the tools to be successful, then United won't see another Premier League title for a very long time.",
      "The owners must back the Portuguese tactician. It's really that simple. Amorim hasn't even had a pre-season to fully implement his ideas or sign the players that he wants! And there are questions over his future?",
      "We mustn't forget that United's squad is not great at all. Lets not kid ourselves and pretend that Amorim has a strong group of players. Jonny Evans was somewhat of a regular at the start of the season.",
      "Mason Mount had his first good game since joining the club for £55m a couple of years ago. Manuel Ugarte hasn't be great. Rasmus Hojlund couldn't hit a barn door. United need to start from scratch with their players - but with Amorim at the helm."

      "Amorim went surprisingly strong with his team selection, which had the potential to backfire, and that happened when Yoro appeared to pick up a foot injury at the start of the second half.",
      "Yoro was replaced by Harry Maguire and his body language didn't look good as he returned to the dressing room. His demeanour seemed to suggest he knew he would be spending some time on the sidelines, which would be a huge blow ahead of the Europa League final.",

      "United suffered their 17th defeat of the Premier League season against West Ham and the same dross that has been served up at Old Trafford throughout the campaign was dished out again.",

      "Amorim looked nervous",
      "Hojlund went down with a shoulder injury just before half-time. The physio sprinted to give Hojlund medical treatment and the televisions in the press box showed Amorim nervously biting his fingers rather than his fingernails.",
      "It was a risk to start the only available senior striker and Amorim's heart would have been in his mouth as Hojlund received treatment, but he was fine to continue.",
      "United will face Chelsea in the Premier League before the Europa League final on May 21 and it would be logical to rest Hojlund, given he's the only senior centre-forward who is available.",

      "Mainoo's position has regularly been tweaked by Amorim, which has made it difficult for him to find his groove, and he was shouted at by Fernandes for not making a run between the lines.",
      "Fernandes gave Mainoo an earful and the youngster nodded as his captain explained where he should have been. The advanced midfield role does not come naturally to Mainoo and the jury remains out on whether that should be his permanent role in Amorim's system.",
      "Dalot chats to Brailsford",
      "Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox and Sir Dave Brailsford were present in the directors' box, and the latter exchanged words with Diogo Dalot as the defender took his seat minutes before kick-off.",

      "He and predecessor Erik ten Hag are the only two permanent managers to have taken charge of United under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, and the part-owner has been called out for his decision making with both.",

The Jim Reaper has ripped the heart out of the club – inflicting damage and hurt from top to bottom, whilst making one bad decision after another and it’s coming back to bite him and the brains trust.",
      "‘Amorim realised he’d walked into a mess pretty quickly after arriving at OT. He knows it’s not going to get better any time soon. He’s not working for football people. He’s working for accountants and stats men, who don’t understand what he wants or needs. I’m not convinced some even care.",
      "‘If I’m right – and Amorim wants out – either now or a couple of months into next season – how can United commit to him? How can they gamble spending money on players he might want? They f*cked up last summer letting ten Hag sp*nk a fortune on more bang average players, instead of sacking him as they should’ve done. Are they going to do the same again? What a shambles the Jim Reaper and Dave Brailsford have created.’",

      "United have not been good in essentially any competition but the Europa League this season. They’re 16th in the Premier League, crashed out in the fifth round of the FA Cup, and lost to Tottenham in the League Cup quarter-finals.",
      "That Spurs are the side they will face in the Europa League final – after an admittedly impressive semi-final performance – may not bode well, then, as the north Londoners have also won both Premier League meetings between the clubs this term.",
      "But there is a lot riding on the European triumph. The winners of the competition get north of £10million, and for United, that could go towards a big transfer.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport, they plan to rival Juventus for Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali, and will reportedly lodge an offer of £100million for the Italian, provided they win the competition.",
      "It’s believed Tonali is liked by high-ranking officials at United, so pursuit of the midfielder could go ahead if they have the relevant funds.",
      "However, a report from FourFourTwo suggests that the Red Devils’ attention is in fact not on the Newcastle man, and they will instead look at cheaper options in the summer.",
      "It would seem unlikely, anyway, that Tonali would ditch Newcastle for United. Both clubs may have Champions League next season, but upon this season’s evidence – currently third in the Premier League – they’ll be much more competitive in England than 16th-placed United.",

      "We certainly await with great interest the gushing broadsheet thinkpieces the following day fansplaining away about how if you didn’t weep tears of joy at the sight of Palace’s magical win and immediately pledge to name your first-born son Selhurst in their honour that you simply don’t get association football.",
      "",
      "Southampton, Leicester and Ipswich win all remaining games\nWe were previously fairly settled on the idea of them getting as few points as possible once it was clear they were all going down without much of a fight, but having between them pocketed a massive five points from their last six games we’re changing tack.",
      "Time for some futile but funny late wins for the relegated trio. Time for a May manager of the month award to be hastily introduced just so Simon Rusk can win it.",
      "",
      "Alexander Isak ends season with back-to-back hat-tricks to pinch Golden Boot\nAgain, there’s nothing personal here. No bias, other than the bias in favour of whatever we decide is funnier. And the funniest thing is for a Golden Boot race long (and correctly) considered settled in favour of Mo Salah suddenly not being that.",
      "Isak nipping in to pinch the trophy with a pair of season-closing hat-tricks would be entertaining enough even without the fact one of them comes against Arsenal and thus has enough rocket-fuelled narrative to get us all through the summer. Win-win.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold blasts a 30-yard own goal in Liverpool’s final game of the season and Adebayors it to every corner of the ground in celebration\nIf they’re going to boo you anyway, might as well go out with a bang.",
      "",
      "Chelsea miss out on the Champions League\nFor reasons plentiful and obvious it is quite simply funnier than any of the other possible teams missing out would be, sorry if that offends.",
      "And yes, they should sack Enzo Maresca anyway; the football is utter sh*t.",
      "",
      "Chelsea don’t win the Europa Conference League\nDoubling down on Chelsea because really all season long nobody has even really considered the possibility of Chelsea not winning the Europa Conference. Nobody has paid any attention and, beyond the neatness of becoming the first club to complete the full set of major European trophies living and dead, nobody will really pay any heed to Chelsea winning it.",
      "But Chelsea not winning it? Now there’s an event. Especially if United have won the Europa League final and Antony thus walks away from this season with winners’ medals in both the Europa League and Conference League to somehow prove the haters both completely wrong and absolutely right in one late twist.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest don’t get to go out for Champions League football because they have European football at home\nBeing improbably third for vast swathes of the season but finding yourself still quite improbably seventh when the music stops and dropping into the Europa Conference rather than the Champions League is a mindf*ck.",
      "Qualifying for Europe was so far beyond even a stretch target for Forest at the start of the season, yet it would now feel like something very close to actual failure. That’s not remotely fair, but none of this is fair. Football isn’t fair. Life isn’t fair.",
      "Then there’s the added noodle-scratcher of whether it would actually be better to land in one of the lesser competitions.",
      "Fast forward a year from now and Forest could be getting ready for a Europa Conference final and thinking how lucky they were not to accidentally qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Of course being in the Champions League is a huge deal and elevates a club to a new level and opens new doors – see Aston Villa’s January dabbles in the loan market for evidence of just how transformative it can be – but what if it is actually more fun to end up like Spurs or Chelsea in a tournament you actually have a chance of winning as long as the sheer weight of Antony’s banter-magnetism isn’t too great?",

      "These six players could all be on the move this summer – three are basically confirmed departures, and Kevin De Bruyne is certain to leave Man City. We reckon Arsenal should be taking a serious look…",
      "",
      "Antony (Manchester United)\nWhat would have seemed a completely insane suggestion a few months ago is now something several big clubs might seriously consider. On loan from Manchester United to Real Betis, Antony has been on fire, helping the La Liga side reach the Europa Conference League final, where they will face Chelsea on May 28.",
      "But in the Premier League, Antony has been one of the worst signings ever. Only Alexis Sanchez’s miserable swap deal with Henrikh Mkhitaryan ranks lower among Manchester United transfers in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. And when it comes to £70million-plus Premier League signings, he’s second-last again in a diabolical list of flops.",
      "Yet there’s a chance the spinning Brazilian could still come good in England – not for United, but perhaps for someone else.",
      "The Red Devils played a blinder by sending Antony on loan to Spain in January. Before his resurgence at Betis, it was widely accepted that £15million would be a generous fee for someone who cost £65m more. Now there’s genuine hope United could recoup closer to £40m – still a colossal loss, but decent damage limitation.",
      "No one expects Mikel Arteta or Andrea Berta to spend too long pondering a move for Antony – and this isn’t a prediction that they will – but he’s shown he can thrive in the right environment, under the right management, and surrounded by competent footballers. Arsenal can offer all three, and if he’s willing to put the defensive work in, he could be a very handy back-up to Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nMartin Odegaard has been a little off the boil this season, and who better to ease the creative burden than a man who’s spent the last decade tormenting Arsenal?",
      "Obviously, wage demands and his injury record are two pretty major stumbling blocks when it comes to signing a player who’s clearly on the decline, but it’s Kevin De Bruyne, lads. He knows full well that the £400,000-a-week wages he earns at Manchester City aren’t going to be matched anywhere outside Saudi Arabia, and while MLS clubs might stretch to $300,000 per week, remaining at the top level still seems to be the Belgian’s main priority.",
      "With that in mind, Arsenal could be an ideal landing spot. We know all about his leadership, experience and winning mentality, but the fact is that KDB can still contribute. He still massively improves a Gunners squad that’s crying out for an X-factor signing – someone who could finally get them over the line in the Premier League or Champions League.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nHad Arsenal not made the pointless and panicky signing of Raheem Sterling, they might have thrown their hat in the ring for Marcus Rashford in the winter transfer window. He would have been exactly what Mikel Arteta was crying out for – and as someone who’s played plenty of football through the middle, he would have been a natural replacement for the injured Kai Havertz.",
      "Instead, Arteta was forced to chuck Mikel Merino up front, ignoring Gabriel Martinelli’s potential in that role. And with Bukayo Saka sidelined until March, there’s been a real lack of bite in the forward areas this year.",
      "Rashford – growing in confidence by the week at Villa Park before suffering a season-ending injury – has swiftly returned to something close to his terrifying best under Unai Emery, freed from the Old Trafford shackles just like Antony. He still has so much to offer, but once again, it comes down to wage demands and whatever fantasy figure United slap on him.",
      "At 27, there are legitimate questions over the logistics of any move – particularly given his wild inconsistency over the last few seasons – but honestly, you have to take the form of any Manchester United player with a hefty pinch of salt. As we’ve seen with Antony and Rashford this year, and Jadon Sancho in 2024, that club is bloody cursed.",
      "Rashford still has the potential to be a world-class forward. He just needs to get this summer move right, and Arsenal could be the perfect fit.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nNkunku scored a frankly ridiculous 58 goals and provided 29 assists in his final two seasons at Leipzig, earning a move to Chelsea.",
      "The Blues struck a deal to sign him before their spiral into chaos truly began. Had the Frenchman waited just a few more months, he might’ve ended up elsewhere – and kept hold of both his form and his reputation as an elite goalscorer.",
      "But he didn’t. And he hasn’t.",
      "Anyone who watched him tear it up in the Bundesliga knows there’s a top-class attacker in there somewhere, but signing Nkunku now carries an obvious degree of risk. Still, Arsenal do love a Chelsea cast-off – and at 27, Nkunku is a fair bit younger than most of the Stamford Bridge alumni they’ve taken on in recent years.",
      "📢 TO THE COMMENTS! Should Arsenal sign any of these six Premier League rejects? Have your say Below The Line…",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nFerguson’s stock has fallen off a cliff, but under the right manager he could still realise his potential. If Arsenal do come calling, it’s likely to be either as a second striker signing or as their tenth-choice option – after being turned down by Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Jonathan David and half a dozen others.",
      "A loan spell at West Ham hasn’t had the desired effect, and Ferguson will return to Brighton for pre-season with a point to prove. Fabian Hurzeler appears content with Danny Welbeck leading the line and, while Welbeck remains a valuable player, he’s someone the young Irishman should be looking to usurp.",
      "A summer exit does feel somewhat inevitable. Arsenal will certainly keep an eye on things, and bringing him in alongside a marquee striker signing would be a statement of intent.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nNot quite a reject or an outcast, but certainly a player United would happily sell for some sweet, sweet pure profit.",
      "Arsenal need midfield reinforcements this summer, with Jorginho set to leave on a free. Martin Zubimendi is arriving from Real Sociedad for around £51million, and if Thomas Partey follows Jorginho out the door, another midfielder will be required.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo would command a hefty fee, but he’s one of the most promising young midfielders in Europe and would add much-needed dynamism and technical quality to an Arsenal midfield currently lacking both. Capable of playing as a No.6, 8 or 10, he fits the profile perfectly.",
      "United might baulk at the idea of selling to what they’d audaciously consider a ‘direct rival’, but if the right offer lands on the table, they’ll surely be tempted. PSR has been a real thorn in the Red Devils’ side, and the sale of an academy graduate would be a financial godsend.",

      "A new report has revealed a ‘sack update’ on Ruben Amorim after his Manchester United side fell to 16th in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag towards the end of last year.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has struggled to implement his preferred playing style with Man Utd‘s squad not suited to his 3-4-3 formation as they have plunged deeper into the bottom half.",
      "Man Utd suffered their 17th Premier League loss of the season on Sunday, losing 2-0 against West Ham. This leaves Amorim’s 16th-placed side a point and a place above fellow strugglers Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "United have also failed in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup this season, so it is a good job that their run to the Europa League final has been a saving grace in an otherwise disastrous season.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim ‘sack plan’ unwittingly revealed six weeks ago",
      "Man Utd will sneak into next season’s Champions League if they beat Spurs in the Europa League final, but Amorim bemoaned his players focusing on this competition after their loss against West Ham.",
      "“Everybody here has to think seriously about a lot of things. Everybody is thinking about the [Europa League] final. The final is not the issue. We have bigger things to think about,” Amorim said.",
      "“I’m talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team. We need to change that.”",
      "He added: “It’s a decisive moment in the history of the club. We need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "“If we start like this, if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different people.”",
      "Amorim has also admitted that he’s “embarrassed” to be Man Utd manager at the moment and a report from Football Insider has revealed a ‘sack update’, with the Europa League final unexpected to make a big impact on his future.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim is fully expected to be in charge at Man United at the start of the 2025-26 campaign – even if they lose the Europa League final against Tottenham, sources have told Football Insider.",
      "‘It is believed the Red Devils have drawn up a long-term plan with Amorim and they are not considering parting company with the Portuguese boss.",

      "Send your views on this subject or any other to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Nothing at Man Utd is as bad as it seems\nRuben Amorim seems like a decent man, and his admission after the West Ham game has sent the gossip machine into overdrive about his leaving the job. However, in the direst of dire seasons, it’s worth looking for signs of hope. Here are a few:",
      "This team had turned a corner around March, and while not winning games, was showing signs of solidity, especially against the top teams. But the dual challenges of the Europa League and the PL have meant the constant prioritisation of the former, in the last 4 weeks. So we’ve had a somewhat weakened team in the PL games, especially in defence.",
      "Harry Amass is far from Premier League ready, he probably needs to go on loan to a Championship clubs and play a season of punishing physical football. But as a team it’s clear that the Europa is being prioritised which I’m sure impacts the mental state of all players on the pitch.",
      "I’d really like to see a quantitative analysis of the injuries suffered by PL teams. Every team feels that they were unlucky with injuries, but I suspect United (and Spurs) have had it quite bad this year. Every time a player gains a little form he seems to go off for a few weeks (or months), for us. Martinez, Zirkzee, Dalot, De Ligt have all gotten injured just as a run of regular games in the right position was bringing them into some kind of confident form. Others like Mount, Mainoo, Amad, Maguire, and Shaw have had months out and have had to be nursed back with managed minutes.",
      "The lack of a settled defence is particularly debilitating – we seem to have had about seventeen thousand combinations of the back 3 in one season. The 18 year old Tyler Fredricson played well on the left in his first game, but then on the right versus Brentford. Lindelof’s confidence is so low, he might as well be playing his first professional game. Mazroui has been running on fumes lately, and Dalot is out for the season it seems. DeLigt has been in and out. Ayden Heaven looked great, for the few games he played before he went off injured. But he’s only 18. Shaw is still feeling his way in. Yoro is now injured – let’s hope not for too long.",
      "Dorgu is still relatively new to the PL and he’s 20 years old. Especially given the physicality of the PL, it’s a real challenge for the young players to come up to scratch physically and mentally. If we had a consistent run with say Maguire, DeLigt and Martinez as the settled back 3, with Yoro as the option, and with Mazraoi and Shaw able to step in occasionally – I think this season goes differently. Not to mention the cliche of the impact the lack of a settled defence on the goalkeeper.",
      "At the other end, it’s all about poor Hojlund. The one striker on whom everybody depends, who is so out of form that he couldn’t score a pint at a brewery. And yet there are no options here, with the Rashford meltdown, and Garnacho who is good for the odd worldy but generally unreliable with his decision making. And when your main striker isn’t scoring goals, the opposition find it easy to block the other routes. If your striker is in form, it also opens up opportunities for others to score.",
      "This is a feast or famine situation and United are most definitely in a famine. In the past few games we’ve created more chances than the opposition, but when you’re not scoring goals it always puts more pressure on the defence.",
      "How much of this is fixable? My argument is that Amorim desperately finds a way to bring consistency to his backline – whether through luck, or finding more indestructible defenders. And he needs at least 2 front players who are capable of scoring in the range of 20 goals a season. If the combined sales of Garnacho, Sancho, and Rashford allow for (say) Cunha and Liam Delap – it would be a different team.",
      "The midfield is actually quite competitive when everybody is fit and at the top of their game. When you can combine Dalot/Mazraoui/Amad on the left, and Dorgu/Leon (incoming)/Shaw on the right, with Mainoo, Bruno, Casemiro (managed minutes), and Ugarte in the middle. Sure, another solid DM wouldn’t hurt with the money we save from Eriksen and Lindelof salaries.",
      "None of this is to suggest that United will become CL contenders overnight. There’s a lot more missing in terms of chemistry and style. But maybe Amorim deserves one preseason and even then I’ll take a good run that gets us into the Europa League next season.",
      "What is even the point of football without hope?\nVed Sen",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",
      "",
      "Are we all Spurs?\nAppreciate we’re a week off it but with the Europa League final fast approaching I’ve been thinking a bit about who I’d rather won and, as a result, salvaged a modicum of pride from an absolutely disastrous season for both clubs by winning a second tier European trophy.",
      "And….the answer is Spurs isn’t it?",
      "The trophy drought stuff doesn’t really matter, if you squint really hard there are the foundations of a reasonably good team there, the Champions League money isn’t going to be especially transformational and frankly, it would be quite funny for them to win something a year after Harry Kane left.",
      "Man Utd on the other hand? Absolutely no way we can keep letting them getting away with salvaging short lived pride by somehow bozoing their way to another silver sticking plaster for their self inflicted wounds.",
      "Both are obviously equally bad outcomes, but it’s Spurs all the way for me.\nSimon, London",
      "READ: Man Utd and Tottenham bin fires deserve zero credit for Europa League final",
      "",
      "The pearl-clutching is a nonsense\nTottenham and United have been abominations in the league season. Awful. Beyond argument.",
      "That said, it’s probably quite fair to say it is a complete anomaly. Tottenham finished fifth last season and United won the FA Cup – following on from another trophy the year prior.",
      "They are, at this exact moment in time, pretty rotten but the absolute pearl clutching about European football being diminished, if not worse, is a bit tedious.",
      "Two teams who are routinely in the biggest competitions are having a pig of a season. I would wager that this time next season neither will be remotely close to the positions they are now.\nDan Mallerman",
      "",
      "Ashamed of being a Liverpool fan\nI’m sure this sounds like a massive overreaction – but I’m so appalled at the Trent booing and vitriol that I no longer want to be associated with supporting a club that has a fan base that claims “you’ll never walk alone”. After 40 years of being one, I don’t think I can carry on being a Liverpool fan.",
      "This kid should be looked at as an inspiration for the city and fellow scousers – a local lad who won EVERYTHING for his boyhood club and didn’t cost us a cent. And now the “fans” are upset because he doesn’t share the typical scouse mentality of wanting to stay in the city and be happy with his lot. It’s pathetic man – grow up! “BuT He’s LeAvInG oN a FrEE!” – this was the only way he was ever going to get a move to Madrid which, let’s be honest, is a step up from Liverpool as a football club.",
      "And to all the podcasts and supporter channels (I’m looking at you Redmen and Anfield Index) that are now saying “I don’t agree with booing him” after you fanned the flames of discontent for the last 6-12 months about what a traitor he will be if he leaves. Shame on you.\nAndy (former Liverpool fan)",
      "",
      "…There is nothing more pathetic than an adult booing a twenty something sportsman. I should know…I did it once and have lived with the shame ever since.",
      "At the 2015 cricket World Cup final after we’d won the game, I booed Shane Watson as he was being presented with his winners medal. My kids were next to me. It became a chorus ringing around the MCG. What were we booing? A bunch of things. That he’d never quite met our expectations. That the selectors kept on picking him. That Cricket Australia sucked. The guy had just won the World Cup and we booed him.",
      "I hope some of my people who booed Trent will, in the cold light of day, feel some of the shame and remorse I’ve felt having booed a guy who was just doing his best and having some of the biggest success of his life. I’m sorry Watto – I was an arse.\nAussie Red (If we at least got PSR relief for TAA’s market value, I think a lot of us would be fine)",
      "",
      "Get off your high horses\nThere seems to be a lot of high-horsie people about the place since yesterday. While I for one applauded Trent, I get the boos from some. It happened to Owen and McManaman, so why not him?",
      "In 2005 Ferdinand was roundly booed by United fans during his contract negotiations after meeting with Chelsea. Rooney too in 2010, Giggs in 2003 during a loss of form and Zirkzee this year. At Arsenal Fabregas was booed on his return, as was Van Persie, Ashley Cole – an invincible.",
      "Trent may have been better off not announcing it publicly until after the end of the season, but it was always going to happen and fans of other clubs getting self-righteous about it are failing to look to the recent past and their own behaviour.",
      "Trent will be fine but the move has sacrificed his place as a true club legend the same as others have done before at Liverpool and other clubs.\nIJR",
      "",
      "Jamie Carragher and Liverpool ‘fans’\nFirstly, I must address Jamie Carragher’s petulant and frankly pathetic spat with Gary Neville over the fact G-Nev basically had the bare faced nerve to tip Arsenal for the Prem pre-season. Jamie, your team has won the league, you absolute f*cking clown, is that not enough for you to act with a little bit of grace and class? Also, and this is fact remember, this is a grown man who saw fit to spit in a child’s face from his car yet he’s still on our screens.",
      "And secondly, Liverpool “fans” booing one of their own? And what for exactly? I mean all he’s done is serve out his contracts with the highest level of professionalism, and whilst doing so, ensuring his team win every major honour possible in that time. Yep, what an absolute sh*thouse.",
      "And Liverpool fans wonder why a large proportion of other club’s supporters dislike them so much? Yep, a mystery indeed.",
      "Lastly, and oh how we laughed at the irony……… You’ll Never Walk Alone? I reckon even Trent would already have something to say about that. What. A. Joke.\nAndy FTM (can’t wait to squeak past Coventry and then Sheff Utd so we can get promoted, enjoy it for roughly 10 minutes, and then realise we’ll be beating Derby’s 11 point record next season)",
      "",
      "Destroying the justifications\nFirstly, all the mails condemning Liverpool fans this morning: I 100% agree. It was pretty pathetic and doesn’t put the supporters in a great light. Secondly, I wanted to come back on Rob and some of his justifications for booing.",
      "…I’m wouldn’t have booed Trent if I’d been at Anfield. I think though many aren’t getting (or are choosing to miss) the anger at him.",
      "For most of us, it isn’t that he is going. We accept every player may move even though sometimes it is sad for fans when they do. We also know we are fickle (‘’sell Nunez and Diaz! Buy Isak!’’) and that the club doesn’t bat an eyelid letting lifelong Liverpool fans leave if they don’t make the grade.",
      "“It is how Trent has gone about it.” – You mean continued to give everything, work hard and try his best to win the league? Shame on him.",
      "“It is the signing a 4-year rather than 6-year deal.” How dare he sign a contract where he only commits the next 4 years of his life to a club! For shame",
      "“It the gaslighting at Leicester – don’t you think some fans might have thought that amazing reaction might have meant something rather than adding to the personal highlights reel/weird leaving video.” – Or maybe he scored a really important goal to help Liverpool win the league and he got excited?",
      "“It is the announcing he’s leaving before the end of the season (so he can manoeuvre to play in a tournament for Real this season).” or maybe he just wanted to say goodbye at Anfield? (that worked out well)",
      "“It is because he’s done it in a way that has deprived us of a mega fee and will cost us a fortune to replace. The voices saying ‘he didn’t cost you anything!’ don’t understand basic finance”. For the last time, players do not owe it to you to sign a contract just to get the club a fee!!! This narrative is genuinely pathetic. He signed a 4 year deal. He fulfilled his end of the bargain. If he had signed a 6-year deal and then said he wanted to leave, I absolutely 100% know for certain that you would be criticising him for wanting to leave mid-contract.",
      "“It is that egotistical video that for some reason the club shared during the season. Wait until after the parade! But see above. He wants out asap to play for a European rival.” There is literally no club that Trent could move to that would not be a “European Rival”.",
      "“It is the ‘’I’ll always support the club’’… what? Even when we play against you?” Yes? Is that a problem?",
      "Trent has been a starring member of the team that has won it all and brought LFC to 20 English titles. He should be (and is) a club legend. The fact that is is being criticised for seeing out his contract, rather than handing in a transfer request mid-contract is just utterly bizarre. He should have got a huge ovation and we wish him well as he goes off to a new challenge. Instead, pathetic, small minded idiots chose to see him leave under a cloud.",
      "Worth noting that there was a significant portion of the crowd who were clapping Trent. Hopefully he realised that not all fans are such morons.\nMike, LFC, Dubai",
      "",
      "Cheers Trent\nCan I personally thank TAA for his move to Madrid and moving the mailbox narrative away from the tedious Arsenal narrative.",
      "YNWA ….more like LOL.\nColin, Dublin Gooner",
      "We have some more Trent Alexander-Arnold reaction, but the real anger should be directed towards the old, rich, white men.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly yet to make a ‘formal offer’ to Liverpool as they look to secure Trent Alexander-Arnold’s services for the Club World Cup.",
      "Xabi Alonso has been told a Bundesliga star could be “the one” for him to sign at Real Madrid, while it’s been suggested Trent Alexander-Arnold is a “very different” right-back ...",
      "According to reports, Liverpool are ‘fully expected’ to sanction Trent Alexander-Arnold’s ‘early exit’ to Real Madrid ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly planning a ‘masterstroke’ signing in which they will look to sign another Liverpool star on a free transfer after their move for Trent Alexander-Arnold.",

      "We’ve been pretty down on this Premier League season at various points so let’s give credit where it’s due: that was a brilliant weekend.",
      "And the not-so-secret reason why it was such a brilliant weekend? Misery. Despair. Hearts breaking in two.",
      "We haven’t yet fully recovered from the saccharine, sickly sweet response to Newcastle’s Carabao Cup win, an event we were all instructed was one of great wondrousness that we should all be enjoying. We were baffled then and remain baffled now.",
      "Why should anyone other than Newcastle fans be delighted about Newcastle winning something?",
      "What we do understand is why for plenty of other ‘neutral’ supporters it was the more desirable outcome from the final. Everton supporters, for instance. Manchester United supporters. Any fans who find Liverpool’s This Means More exceptionalism more grating than Newcastle’s Best Fans in the World exceptionalism.",
      "And that brings us to the key point underpinning so much of football fandom. It’s not just about nice things happening to your team; it’s about bad things happening to other teams. And not necessarily even ones you particularly dislike.",
      "When you stop and think about it, this is obvious. If we had to rely on the joy our own teams actually provide us then almost all of us would surely have packed up the daft idea of following a football team years ago. For the vast majority of clubs the joy-despair ratio is all wrong.",
      "No, what keeps us coming back over and over is the fact that no matter what guff and nonsense your lot might be up to, at least someone else somewhere is showing more of their arse.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim and Ange, Newcastle, Dias, Rusk, Beto, Jackson",
      "Now to be clear here, we’re not subscribers to the idea that rivals’ disappointment should be more important than your own success. There’s a sliding scale here, but this is where we’d place ourselves: Spurs fans being quite happy to lose to Man City and scupper Arsenal’s league hopes at no great cost to themselves (avoiding Champions League qualification last season could yet prove their best decision in decades…) is absolutely fine, but Spurs fans who would settle for the hypothetical scenario of them not winning the Europa League if it meant Arsenal not winning the Champions League is too much.",
      "But the disappointment and upset of others is still a huge part of being a football fan and it’s ridiculous to pretend otherwise. It’s one more reason why we didn’t really understand that whole Newcastle thing. Knowing other fans are having their piss boiled to dangerous levels is a huge contributing factor to what makes your own success so enjoyable.",
      "Why would you want everyone else to be happy about it? Where’s the fun in that? This applies to success both large and small, too. Do Liverpool fans enjoy their title win more or less because it’s caused Mikel Arteta’s salty head to fall off? Do Southampton fans enjoy their point against Man City more or less because it’s caused Ruben Dias’ salty head to fall off?",
      "The whole guard of honour discourse is quite silly, but its existence tells us that deep down we all know this phenomenon is real. The idea of seeing Chelsea or Arsenal or whoever forced into this weird ritual humiliation by a luckless quirk of the fixture list is deeply enjoyable for everyone else.",
      "Which brings us back to this weekend and why it was so good: because so few people were actually happy.",
      "Man City weren’t happy because Southampton decided to actually defend against them, which is in fairness quite poor etiquette when they haven’t bothered with it against anyone else for 35 games.",
      "Arsenal aren’t happy because they’ve won nothing again and have dread fear about multiple potential banter outcomes to this season.",
      "Even Liverpool weren’t happy at their latest Anfield title party because they had simply no choice but to boo a player who has helped deliver everything those fans had craved for 30 years but now fancies playing for the biggest football club on earth for a bit.",
      "Chelsea: not happy.",
      "Man United and Spurs: involved in what is perhaps the all-time greatest season-long act of piss-boiling ever conceived, one which can now only end with one of those clubs as happy as a dog with two dicks while the other hits new depths of despair and everyone else is furious about one side of the equation and laughing their bollocks clear off about the other.",
      "They are, therefore, clearly the two standout clubs of this season and we have no notes. The fact they have now become so committed to ensuring they finish 16th and 17th to maximise the emotional extremes at the end of it all is truly magnificent.",
      "Even Nottingham Forest have found a way to bring misery upon themselves in a season that now brings a guaranteed place in European competition next season. The owner is literally on the pitch having a go at the manager because they might now only finish seventh.",
      "Here, then, is just another way this game is far more about misery than joy. Because the shift in expectations that follows things like Forest’s profoundly unlikely-looking season means that ‘We’d have given everything to be precisely where we are now back in August’ ends up meaning two-fifths of f*ck all in reality even though its logic is utterly impeccable.",
      "Do we have any actual problem with Nottingham Forest? Not really. Did we nevertheless take perverse and extreme delight in pinpointing the precise moment yesterday where their hearts broke in two? Of course we did.",
      "And don’t pretend you didn’t feel it too.",
      "Social media and ragebait and the wider collapse of society in general may have all helped hasten football’s descent into rabid and often unhealthy tribalism, but let’s not pretend the despair of others hasn’t always been an absolute core element of fan culture.",

      "We wonder if The Athletic’s Manchester United man realised that he was revealing their Ruben Amorim ‘sack plan’ in early April?",
      "",
      "I am what I Amorim\nSunday brought a rat-tat-tat of narratives with the Nottingham Forest owner having a dicky-fit on the pitch, the Liverpool fans booing Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ruben Amorim making it clear that he blames himself for this rotten Manchester United side and might eventually walk if he cannot solve the endemic problems at the club.",
      "The latter story is particularly compelling because it is very rare that a Premier League manager says – and we quote: “It’s not the players’ fault. It’s my fault; I’m responsible.”",
      "And that was consistently his stance, telling the written press: “I don’t want to talk about players. I’m talking about myself and the culture in the club and the culture in the team.",
      "“I have that feeling, we need to change that and we need to be really strong in the summer and to be brave because we will not have a next season like this.",
      "“If we start like this, or if the feeling is still here, we should give the space to different persons.”",
      "Amorim was at great pains to repeat that the buck stopped with him; he is somehow only able to motivate his players for one competition and that’s on him.",
      "But where’s the fun in that?",
      "The Daily Mirror back page has him ‘ripping into’ Manchester United, while the Daily Star have Amorim ‘tearing into his Manchester United flops’.",
      "He literally said “it’s not the players’ fault”, fellas.",
      "The Star laughably claim this was ‘a threat to walk’ from Amorim, with ‘Buck up or I’ll quit’ as the headline. Manchester United must be absolutely shaking that an utterly failing manager is ‘threatening to walk’. Better ‘buck up’, lads.",
      "But what is always, always better than a manager threatening to quit? A delicious, juicy sacking, of course.",
      "‘Man Utd ‘have sack plan’ as Ruben Amorim accepts his fate after West Ham defeat’",
      "That’s the Express, quoting absolutely nobody there. Mediawatch remembers when all this was trees and quote marks denoted quotes.",
      "Now, the Express can claim that Man Utd ‘have sack plan’ because – and this really is tremendous – The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell was asked in a Q and A in early April whether Amorim would come under pressure next season and he wrote:",
      "‘As he repeated again post Forest, he will not get time if results continue as they are. United cannot be 13th again next season. Clearly the board, Ratcliffe, Brailsford, Berrada, want him to work as otherwise in would look very bad on them’",
      "And that is the ‘sack plan’ touted fully six weeks later. Are you not ashamed?",
      "Over at the Mirror, they are claiming to be in the know about this sacking business…",

      "Is his stance that sacking Amorim would be mental, by any chance? Or have they just rolled out Ratcliffe’s quotes from March about Amorim doing a good job? Oh yes indeed.

      "",
      "Newcastle\nIt could have gone two different ways. Newcastle ending their long trophy drought might just as easily have derailed the rest of their season, the instinct to celebrate and that release of pent-up emotion providing the most intoxicating and understandable distraction imaginable.",
      "But harnessed properly, it was always a potential springboard for something not greater and certainly not as tangible, but definitely more beneficial in the long run. While Newcastle cannot put Champions League qualification alongside the Carabao Cup in their trophy cabinet, it means more for their future aspirations.",
      "And no team has earned more Premier League points since the Carabao final than winners Newcastle, who have used that platform and momentum to surge past almost all of their rivals into prime position:",

Newcastle have played members of the Big Six eight times at St James’ Park this season, winning six, drawing two, scoring 17 goals and conceding six. Those results formed a crucial part of their Carabao glory and seem likely to do the same with this Champions League push.",

The man responsible for a quarter of Southampton’s points and two-thirds of their clean sheets having taken charge of just one sixth of their games has crossed an underwhelming but entirely necessary finish line nonetheless.",
      "In dragging Southampton beyond record-breakingly dreadful and into the mere realm of historically poor without the stigma attached, Rusk has delivered on his remit and bruised some egos along the way.",
      "The 43-year-old should be allowed to step back into a permanent role on the first-team coaching staff in the summer under whichever poor sap is chosen to lead their Championship promotion charge. Rusk has shown enough to suggest he is worth keeping around.",

      "Unai Emery’s worth is undoubted but he continues to prove it in circumstances such as these. Away at Bournemouth without Youri Tielemans and Marcus Rashford, the Spaniard figured that Villa’s best chance was also without the ball. And that in itself was a risk, considering their six lowest shares of Premier League possession this season had returned five defeats and a draw.",

      "The key to their season has been in games against the teams around them. Only Liverpool have more points against the top half than Villa (28), who have done better in just one Premier League season – the 42-game inaugural campaign of 1992/93. That is down to a change in mindset overseen wonderfully by the manager.",

The success of Beto as his latest centre-forward reclamation project should offset any desperate transfer moves at least.",
      "There was one sensational line from the Everton manager about the Guinean’s progress. “He’s done great, he’s improving,” Moyes said. “If he was a 19-year-old striker you’d say he’s got a bit to go, he’s not but he’s certainly improving,” he added of a 27-year-old who cannot afford to coast on potential.",
      "Nor does he have any inclination. Moyes mentioning how Beto trains “like you wouldn’t believe” and “is really trying” is a better indication of his standing under the Scot than the seven goals he has scored in 17 games since his appointment – as many as he mustered in 50 Sean Dyche appointments.",
      "No player has scored more goals in the Premier League this season without providing a single assist, and that narrowed focus between the posts has worked wonders. Unless Leeds offer stupid money, Beto has a part to play in this sustained Everton revival.",

      "Manchester United and Spurs\nThere have been games with bigger stakes before, but surely none with such a ridiculous gulf between the potential reward for victory and further embarrassment inflicted by defeat.",
      "It is difficult to recall the last fixture both teams so willingly torched their entire seasons for. Neither Manchester United nor Spurs were particularly wrong to have prioritised the Europa League basically since the knockout stage commenced, but the idea their Premier League form had to be offered as an unavoidable sacrifice is preposterous – not least because their apparent advantage over continental opposition will be entirely redundant in the final.",
      "Both Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou made reference to “the levels” needing to be higher after their latest defeats, with surprise that players could not step up and motivate themselves for games the managers have openly written off in terms of importance.",
      "Their approaches in the build-up have been different, with Amorim publicly wondering whether Champions League qualification might actually be worse for his players, rather ignoring how it should offset the need for any more unnecessary job losses throughout the club, while Postecoglou has made no attempt to hide what it would mean for Spurs.",
      "But both have essentially said for months that these games don’t really matter, as their combined 37 Premier League defeats bear out. “Who cares if we’re struggling in the league? It’s a separate thing,” Postecoglou said in a fair reaction after reaching the Europa final, but that sentiment inevitably transmits through the squad.",
      "The result is two Premier League teams entering a stupidly important one-off game in wilfully abysmal form, and as much as the lucrative and glorious plaster on offer for the winners has been highlighted, it doesn’t feel like nearly enough has been made of what the loser will be left with: a historically bad campaign, a squad with shattered confidence, a manager with at best an uncertain future and a summer which must go perfectly just to stabilise themselves.",

      "“They can do whatever they want. It’s on us to break them. They didn’t do much but we have to accept the way they play. I don’t agree with Ruben. We have to accept it,” is absolutely right.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that the aversion to introspection so proudly worn by one of their leaders does not pervade a side in no position whatsoever to snipe at the way other teams play. It was always curious when they blamed those rare slips at their peak on the opposition choosing not to hand three points over, but feeling the need to punch so far down when they have been laughably short of their own standards all campaign is embarrassing.",
      "Manchester City had largely outgrown that finger-pointing, responsibility-shirking part of their identity, and any rebuild should involve restoring it. As eagerly awaited as Rodri’s comeback is, it would be regrettable if it heralds the return of Manchester City’s sore loser edge too.",
      "",
      "Erling Haaland\nThe Are Manchester City Better Without Erling Haaland narrative strand will never die. A ten-year contract ought to have rendered such talk null and void but Guardiola’s side were notably worse for the Norwegian’s presence against Southampton.",
      "The strikerless 4-2-2-2 formation had been refined to the point Manchester City were on their longest winning streak since October, and sacrificing it to give Haaland the full 90 minutes on his return felt like a mistake.",
      "Guardiola “did not expect” Southampton to set up so defensively and simply said of Haaland’s lack of supply that “Erling needs people to deliver balls to him” regardless of what position they play, but it does feel as though his effectiveness is contingent on using wingers, which in turn relies on there being the sort of stable midfield Manchester City cannot currently offer.",
      "If Rodri cannot make it for the FA Cup final then there could be a good old-fashioned Guardiola overthink in reverting back to the system which inspired Manchester City to beat Crystal Palace 5-2 just one month ago. Omar Marmoush feels like the better option than Haaland right now.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva mentioned that “the last six or seven games” had not been good enough from Fulham, but it feels like the eighth in that sequence – the 3-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup quarter-final – was the most damaging.",
      "On the morning of that game, Fulham were eighth and three points off the Champions League places. But since then their form has been miserable, with only the two Europa League finalists and relegated three faring worse.",
      "The international break in March might have killed their momentum and that tendency to drop points from winning positions has become a particular problem. Only Liverpool, Arsenal and Nottingham Forest have led more Premier League games than Fulham this season but the Cottagers seem to build their foundations on quicksand and have too frequently squandered those advantages.",

      "Nicolas Jackson\nA quite silly thing to do for a player whose talents are obvious but his drawbacks no less so. The race between a player’s Premier League goals (24) and Premier League cards (18) should not be so close, particularly when his former manager outlined two years ago a need to be more disciplined which appears to have gone ignored.",

And when you consider Bournemouth have lost 13 games in all competitions this season, but the only two by more than one goal were both administered by Liverpool, you see his point.",

It is a bar Southampton (six) are set to clear, but Ipswich have only managed to match it while already conceding more goals at Portman Road than the Black Cats at the Stadium of Light two decades ago.",

      "Four Manchester United flops are joined by one Liverpool struggler in the Premier League Worst XI of the weekend.",
      "As always, match ratings are taken from WhoScored.",
      "",
      "GK: Bernd Leno (Fulham) – 5.42\nLeno’s weak attempt to parry away Beto’s shot handed Everton an impressive away win, and that error earned the German a spot in the Premier League Worst XI. He has a pretty poor season by his standards.",
      "",
      "RB: Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest) – 5.80\nIt was a close call between Aina and Bournemouth’s Adam Smith (5.83), but the Nottingham Forest man makes the cut after a lacklustre performance in his side’s disappointing 2-2 draw against Leicester City.",
      "Aina picked up a yellow card, lost his only aerial duel, committed an error leading to a shot, and failed to make any tackles or interceptions.",
      "",
      "CB: Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – 6.11\nManchester United have won six, drawn six, and lost 13 of their Premier League matches under Ruben Amorim. That is a diabolical record, and their latest defeat – at home to West Ham on Sunday – left them 16th in the table with a -11 goal difference.",
      "Say what you want about this being a transitional period, the players not being Amorim’s, or the focus being on Europe – this is still a squad worth over £700million in transfer fees and packed with international footballers. Amorim is embarrassed, and rightly so; winning the Europa League should not paper over the cracks of a worst-ever Premier League campaign.",
      "Anyway, rant over. Yoro struggled on Sunday before coming off injured.",
      "",
      "CB: Luke Shaw (Manchester United) – 5.90\nShaw played 52 minutes against West Ham, coming off alongside Yoro. He wasn’t injured – Amorim is simply managing his minutes carefully given his wretched injury record.",
      "Deployed at left centre-back in a back three, Shaw offered little defensive output: just one clearance, no interceptions, no tackles, and not a single aerial duel contested.",
      "",
      "LB: Harry Amass (Manchester United) – 5.76\nSticking with the shambles that is Manchester United, 18-year-old left wing-back Harry Amass made his fourth Premier League start in five games, which sounds promising until you realise he’s lost every single one, with an aggregate score of 11–4. Not ideal.",
      "United have now won just once in nine league matches, having seemingly written off their top-flight campaign the moment Ruben Amorim walked through the door.",
      "In their latest disappointment, Amass was dribbled past twice and probably shouldn’t have lasted the full 90 minutes.",
      "For the record, the lowest-rated actual left-back this week was Arsenal’s Myles Lewis-Skelly (6.08).",
      "",
      "DM: Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool) – 5.62\nIpswich’s Jack Taylor and Chelsea’s Romeo Lavia both had tough weekends, each recording a 5.78 match rating – but it’s Liverpool’s Ryan Gravenberch who claims the unwanted spot in this week’s worst XI.",
      "Arsenal came from two goals down at Anfield to salvage a point that should offer real encouragement heading into next season. They were helped by a toxic atmosphere following Trent Alexander-Arnold’s introduction, with the bizarre boos clearly unsettling Arne Slot’s side.",
      "Gravenberch, in particular, looked uncharacteristically unsettled. He was dribbled past once, failed with his only dribble attempt, misplaced four passes, made no interceptions, was dispossessed twice, committed one foul, and made an error leading to a shot.",
      "Fair play to Arsenal, who managed to rattle the Premier League’s best No.6 this season without Declan Rice.",
      "",
      "CM: Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United) – 5.74\nBack to the shambles at Old Trafford, is it? Hardly surprising that another goalless home defeat sees four Manchester United players in the worst XI – and rounding it off is £50m summer signing Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Uruguayan lasted just 59 minutes after failing to make any meaningful impact, with a dreaded error leading to a shot contributing to his poor 5.74 rating.",
      "",
      "CM: Andreas Pereira (Fulham) – 5.66\nFulham took the lead against Everton in the most 3pm blackout fixture imaginable – but they never took control and ultimately slumped to a deserved 3-1 defeat.",
      "They lost the midfield battle, with Andreas Pereira and Sander Berge struggling to assert themselves. Pereira committed one error leading to a shot and lost possession nine times.",
      "It’s a limp ending to what has been a genuinely fantastic Premier League season. Fulham have now lost four of their last five matches, with their only win in that time coming against the second-worst team in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "RW: Matheus Cunha (Wolves) – 5.73\nCunha is gleefully aware that he is, by some distance, Wolves’ best player. With that status comes a sense of responsibility – one that seemingly compels him to drop all the way back into his own box to collect the ball from goal-kicks. Against a high-pressing Brighton side at Molineux, this proved costly. Caught in possession by Mats Wieffer, the Dutchman was brought down in the box for a stonewall penalty. Danny Welbeck converted from the spot to score his tenth Premier League goal of the season – the first time he’s reached double figures in a single campaign.",
      "It could have been worse for Cunha, who was fortunate not to be sent off for the last-man foul. There was no common sense applied by VAR, who deemed the double jeopardy rule sufficient to spare the Brazilian a red card. But watching the replay, it’s clear there was no attempt to play the ball – Cunha’s eyes are fixed on Wieffer before he deliberately brings him down.",
      "Oh well. Wolves still lost 2-0, so literally only I care about that.",
      "",
      "LW: Jacob Ramsey (Aston Villa) 5.27\nVilla secured a crucial 1-0 win at Bournemouth to keep their Champions League hopes alive. But on what had been a decent afternoon for Jacob Ramsey, a second yellow card ensured a nervy finish for Unai Emery and his players.",
      "They held on – but that doesn’t do Ramsey any favours here.",
      "",
      "ST: Nicolas Jackson (Chelsea) – 4.98\nSent off for an incredibly stupid assault on Newcastle United’s Sven Botman, Jackson seemed to have sabotaged Chelsea’s chances of a comeback in their biggest league game of the season. Oddly, though, Enzo Maresca’s side looked far better without him.",
      "Either way, he was a shoo-in the moment that first-half red card was shown.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘preparing a massive outlay’ to ‘secure’ three Premier League stars as ‘key signings’ this summer.",
      "PGMOL has been asked to consider John Brooks’ future as a Premier League official after Nicolas Jackson’s red card for Chelsea vs Newcastle.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is a fool but Chelsea were much better without him anyway. Newcastle were very good then pretty bad, but we can’t imagine they give a damn.",
      "A former England international has likened one of Man Utd’s summer transfer targets to Eric Cantona, but warns they’ll need to do much more.",
      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Super agent Jorge Mendes could complicate Manchester United’s summer move for Wolves attacker Matheus Cunha, according to reports."

      "Remember when ‘playing on a Thursday night’ was uttered as an insult? A symbol of a club’s failure to get in the Champions League. Treated as a kind of curse, the Europa League just got in the way of the important business of earning free money in the Premier League from a higher finish. Money which could be frittered away on second-rate talent, of course.",
      "The PFMs sat with their legs apart and held it in contempt, very much the glass of dry white white wine to their three bottles of strong Barolo and they would put out weakened sides in order to get knocked out as soon as possible.",
      "“It’s one of those competitions that teams get in and then they try to get out of,” said Harry Redknapp who spoke and, to an extent still speaks, for this viewpoint. Playing on a Thursday and Sunday was spuriously claimed to upset players’ delicate biorhythms.",
      "“It takes an even bigger toll in my opinion, that’s the problem. That Thursday night one, every week, and playing Sundays every week…it’s not ideal,” said Redknapp, a physiological expert in his own lunchtime. Is he saying it now that it’s much easier for rubbish Premier League teams to get to a final?",
      "Foreign clubs could cope, of course, but not the delicate Premier League players. Some fans bought this line of bullsh*t and still cling to it, for some reason downplaying one of the few trophies that can be won in a season, having written out an ordered list of trophy importance, based on nothing but some invented truths only they believe.",
      "But now it’s an all-English final, they seem to have decided to take it seriously in a way they did not when Porto beat Braga or Sevilla remarkably won it three times consecutively. Or perhaps we do now because the manager that achieved that feat works in the Premier League so must now be respected. That’s how English exceptionalism works.",
      "Much humour has been derived from Manchester United playing Spurs. Two absolutely chronic bin fires who are both some shade of disgraceful. But the Premier League rewards even the worst with more than £100million of free money; no one from Europe can compete with that.",
      "The truth is, as anyone who watches European football will tell you, other leagues are certainly more regularly entertaining and there are loads of great players who have no interest in playing for an English club. Even though they might earn more, they know that’s not the most important thing. But the teams they play for have diminishing chances of doing well because of simple economics.",
      "A lot of the best players, but not all, have been drawn to the Premier League. That doesn’t mean they play the most entertaining football, of course, but the weight of numbers and overall quality are having an effect because of the sheer volume and depth of resources in favour of the Premier League.",
      "The imbalance is now so massive that it just can’t be ignored, best expressed with Spurs playing Bodo/Glimt. The disparity of resources was profound. Just in case you don’t know how profound, Bodo had one player in the squad worth six million Euro, Spurs had 26 worth more. Now, you don’t have to be critical of this competitive imbalance to recognise that it exists and must influence results. Imagine if, say, rubbish Italian clubs had such an advantage. It’d feel unfair wouldn’t it? Not that it’s possible to totally even out resources and we accept there’ll be differences. It’s the extent of the disparities, not the disparities per se.",
      "As the Premier League becomes ever more financially dominant, it will obviously have an impact on European competitions, especially outside of equally financially dominant sides in the Champions League. Even these rubbish Premier League sides can’t be competed with and they are really terrible. Is it desirable that this should be the case? We’re now at a stage where only a handful of clubs can win any European trophy.",
      "For example, watching Chelsea beat Djurgårdens wasn’t interesting for anyone not a Chelsea fan because of their altogether vastly superior resources. It’s like if they got to an FA Cup final by beating Walsall. You’d think, well, so what? Of course they did.",
      "When West Ham won the Conference League, only when they beat Fiorentina in the final did they play any side even vaguely near their resources. It was hailed as a great victory, but how great was it really? You wouldn’t think that if they won the FA Cup after only playing third or fourth-tier sides and then beat a top Championship side in the final.",
      "If money means anything at all, the Europa and Conference League final should always be between English clubs and if they were as good as is often claimed they are, probably the Champions League too.",
      "Part of the fun of football is not knowing the outcome of games but when fixtures are so imbalanced, you inevitably do. The argument for a separate European money league grows ever stronger the more the gap widens. You just want teams to have a decent chance and right now, that chance is diminishing every year.",
      "It’s not even just about the winners so much as just doing well. How does UEFA pass these tournaments off as proper competitions, because they’re not. Maybe they want them to harden around a few teams. Predictability attracts more investment after all, so the last thing they want is unpredictability.",
      "The Thursday night curse may have been lifted from Premier League clubs just at a time when the competitions are having their competitiveness undermined by grotesque financial imbalance."

      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",

      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",

      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +2.9\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.1% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games.",
      "",
      "5) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.4\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",

That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",

      "",
      "10) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.3\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "11) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +1.3\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",

      "12) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Now being saved for the Europa League.",
      "",
      "13) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.0\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine.

But he under-conceded v Liverpool to drag himself level for the season.",

      "Man Utd will finish this season with a record-low Premier League points total and their most-ever defeats in the competition",
      "By Pete Gill and Ron Walker",
      "Monday 12 May 2025 18:11, UK",
      "Manchester United slumped to yet another new low on Sunday with defeat at home to West Ham.",
      "The result left United just two places above the relegation zone and Ruben Amorim questioning his own future at Old Trafford.",
      "A glance at some of the unwanted records United have set this season may explain why...",
      "Man Utd's defeat to West Ham leaves them on 39 points with two games to play.",
      "Even if they were to win their final two matches, they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023/24.",
      "United's lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League season is 58 in 2021/22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points.",
      "Across the whole of the season things have been bad - but if the Premier League started six games ago, Man Utd would be going down.",
      "Their form over that time ranks them joint bottom of the table along with relegated Southampton and Ipswich, who have also picked up two points and zero wins.",
      "Amorim had an immediate impact when he took over in his previous two jobs, at Braga and Sporting CP. Though he was only with the former for nine league games in 2019/20, he won eight of those and drew the other.",
      "At Sporting, he took over a faltering side in mid-season but picked up six wins and three draws from the club's final 11 games, achieving almost two points per game.",
      "He has made a change in Man Utd's results too - for the worse. Already starting from a low ebb and form which was bad enough to get Erik ten Hag sacked, United's points per game have dropped since Amorim walked through the door.",
      "The loss to the Hammers also means United have suffered their joint-highest number of league defeats in a single season and their most since 1962/63.",
      "Man Utd were already on their worst run of defeats in a Premier League season before Sunday's game, having previously lost 14 matches under Erik ten Hag last season.",
      "Move over, Tottenham Hotspur. There's a new doctor in town. Amorim's United helped West Ham end an eight-game winless run at Old Trafford on Sunday, securing only their second Premier League double over Man Utd in the process.",
      "It's not the first time they've kick-started an opponent into life, either. Back in Amorim's early weeks, a 3-2 home defeat to Nottm Forest ended a run of three defeats for Nuno Espirito Santo's side and inspired them to a run of seven wins from their following eight games.",
      "While United have progressed to the Europa League final, which offers a route back into the Champions League, they have failed to win in the Premier League for the last two months. Their last victory was at Leicester on March 16.",
      "Indeed, if you ignore their matches against the teams already relegated from the Premier League, United have won one of their last 17 Premier League games - with their only calendar-year victory over a team in next season's Premier League being a 1-0 success over Fulham on January 26.",
      "Either way, the fact of the matter is that United are currently enduring their joint-longest winless run in the Premier League.",
      "United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Things have been worse since Amorim took over - they have failed to score in 10 of 25 league games under his management, and have found the back of the net only 30 times.",
      "That's one time more than goal-shy Everton, or Sunday's victors West Ham.",
      "From the days of Andy Cole, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Wayne Rooney to the fifth-lowest scorers in the division.",
      "No one who has seen Man Utd this season would stay they are free-flowing in the final third but, going by their expected goals tally, they should at least rank in mid-table for goals scored.",
      "In fact, they are the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG in the Premier League after Crystal Palace, having found the back of the net more than eight times fewer than the stats suggest they should have.",
      "Sunday's defeat was their second-worst showing in front of goal of the season, racking up an xG of 2.23 but failing to beat Alphonse Areola once.",
      "Nor can United keep a clean sheet. They have conceded the first goal in a match at Old Trafford 12 times this season - the most ever in a Premier League season.",
      "Amorim's Man Utd side are comfortably the leakiest of any iteration since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club 12 years ago, and it's getting worse.",
      "Conceding more than 1.6 goals a game puts him even ahead of Ralf Rangnick's sorry interim reign in 2022, and only makes their struggles in front of goal more pronounced.",
      "Only Spurs and the three relegated sides have been worse at the back since Amorim took over in November last year.",
      "Remember Amorim's angry comments despite drawing with Liverpool in January, in Man Utd's best performance under his management at the time?",
      "The boss looked annoyed that his players found it easier to get themselves up for a 'big' game compared to matches needing more self-motivation.",
      "They wouldn't be the first side to play better against better teams. But it hasn't lasted - Man Utd have won only two of 18 games against top-half opposition this season.",
      "Things are better against teams in the bottom half, but still don't make good reading. Of the eight games they have won against the teams in the bottom 10, five of those have come against the three relegated sides.",
      "Their home defeat to West Ham was their seventh loss to a bottom-half opponent out of 18 matches."

They are fortunate the gap between the Championship and the top-flight is so great otherwise they'd be genuinely flirting with a relegation fight with two Premier League games to go. If they lose both their remaining league games they won't have even amassed 40 points this season - usually the standard bearer of what you need to stay up.",
      "Apart from the flashy feet of Amad Diallo, who got 80 minutes under his belt down the right flank, this was another dispiriting afternoon for the locals.",
      "West Ham carried the greater attacking threat, were more robust without the ball and were clinical with their finishing. United have now failed to score in 14 Premier League games this season - only Southampton (15), Everton (15) and Leicester (16) have blanked more.",
      "Yet this team are one win away from playing Champions League football next season. Someone make it make sense.Lewis Jones",

      "Arsenal had two of their biggest tests of the season this week and how they close the gap to those two teams cannot be clearer now.",
      "Both matches started in the same vein - Arsenal came flying out of the blocks in both. Like in Paris on Wednesday night, the Gunners had multiple chances to open the scoring - most notably Bukayo Saka's from a free-kick - but they failed to take them. Then just like the other night, Arsenal fell behind and were playing catch-up.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side ended the first half with the same number of shots as Liverpool, but they were two goals down. Liverpool took their chances while Arsenal didn't have the firepower. It hit the nail in the coffin that a new striker was needed.",
      "Arsenal's midfield got into countless good areas at Anfield only for there to be a vacuum of emptiness in the penalty box to help out. The first 45 minutes painted the story of their season.",
      "The second half told a little bit more. Leandro Trossard went off injured while Mikel Merino made it six red cards this season for Arsenal. Setbacks and sending offs have also defined their 15-point gap to Liverpool.",
      "But so many red cards and injuries are likely to make up a freak campaign. But if Arsenal don't be ruthless in the forward areas this summer, they won't bridge that gap.Sam Blitz",
      "Arne Slot insisted afterwards that Trent Alexander-Arnold's introduction was not a distraction at Anfield, even getting into an exchange with a journalist in the press conference discussing the percentage of supporters who booed the departing full-back.",
      "The Liverpool coach found himself making a point about the relative decibel levels of booing compared to clapping. Probably the point at which one might have to accept that the reaction to Alexander-Arnold coming on had become a bit of a sideshow.",
      "Slot's calculation regarding the player - who has confirmed he will leave the club at the end of his contract this summer - is coldly logical. He started Conor Bradley because he is the future. He brought Alexander-Arnold on as he thought he could help win the game.",
      "But Liverpool is a club fuelled by emotion and those emotions ran high at Anfield on Sunday. Slot seemed to regard the chants for Bradley and Steven Gerrard as a positive thing but they clearly represented a pointed response to Alexander-Arnold's decision.",
      "Slot insisted afterwards that nothing can take the edge off this Premier League title win. And yet, here he was answering questions about Alexander-Arnold rather than his team. It is an unfortunate way for Liverpool's magnificent campaign to be coming to an end.Adam Bate",
      "West Ham fans were singing about Niklas Fullkrug for much of their enjoyable away day at Old Trafford. They obviously like what they heard from him after the Southampton game. But despite having the adulation of his fans it is very difficult to see how he fits in.",
      "This was another example of West Ham being at their best under Graham Potter when Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen are allowed to play as the flexible front two. Potter has now beaten Arsenal and Manchester United away from home and was minutes away from getting a point at Liverpool.",
      "It was Kudus and Bowen - as a pairing - that provided the attacking platform for West Ham to go and get those results. Kudus, especially, was red hot at Old Trafford. The best player on the pitch. You feel if Potter can add some steel and some trusty lieutenants to this system, West Ham could be a tough nut to crack next season.Lewis Jones",
      "With the sun shining and the buzz of Thursday's Europa League semi-final win energising the Spurs fans ahead of kick-off, there was positivity in the air. It didn't last long.",
      "Crystal Palace swiftly scythed through Ange Postecoglou's much-changed team and what might have otherwise been a celebratory homecoming for Spurs' European finalists instead saw them booed off at the break and then at full-time.",
      "There were plenty of empty seats by that final whistle too. Palace fans had taunted their Spurs counterparts by asking why they were even here as the hosts slumped to a 20th Premier League defeat of the season. That resilience shown in Norway nowhere in sight. Many Spurs supporters seemed to come to the conclusion it wasn't worth watching.",
      "The priority, of course, is that Europa League final. But Postecoglou pointed out fringe players missed their chance to impress and push for a place in his XI for that Man Utd showdown. It will be even harder to catch the eye at in-form Aston Villa on Friday.",
      "This is a group of players hit by injuries this season and Dejan Kulusevski limping off was another worry. From Spurs' physical shape to their performances to the feeling around the club - it's all fragile right now.",
      "Will Bilbao bring a sweet remedy or a crushing blow?Peter Smith",
      "Eberechi Eze was Crystal Palace's match-winner against Spurs, his two goals taking him to five in his last four games in all competitions. But Marc Guehi might just have been their best performer.",
      "The 24-year-old was outstanding from the very first minute of the game, when he cut out a Pedro Porro cross at his near post, setting the tone for a totally dominant individual display.",
      "Every time Spurs got into a dangerous position, Guehi stood in their way, snuffing out danger, tackling, intercepting. A highlight came in the penultimate minute of the game, when he blocked a Heung-Min Son shot with nonchalant ease, then won his side a free-kick.",
      "Moments after that, Guehi provided an example of his outstanding ball-playing ability, sending Eddie Nketiah through on goal with a superb pass in behind Spurs' defence. He used the ball smartly all afternoon, switching play, threading passes into his midfielders.",
      "For Spurs, it was a first-hand reminder of why they, like many other clubs, have coveted him in the past. Guehi's suitors will surely come knocking again in the summer for centre-back who looks increasingly like the full package. Right now it's Palace feeling the benefits.Nick Wright"

      "Monday 12 May 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim insists Man Utd are \"losing the feeling of being a massive club\" after admitting to being “embarrassed” about his side's lack of urgency amid their Premier League struggles.",

      "Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen scored in a 2-0 triumph that meant United have now lost an eye-watering 17 top-flight matches this term, with nine of them coming on home turf.",
      "Their latest meek performance infuriated Amorim, who says there is a \"lack of urgency in everything we do\" and a worrying mentality at a club sitting 16th in the standings.",
      "\"For me the biggest concern is that feeling that 'it's OK', and 'we cannot change our position so much so it's OK',\" the United boss said.",
      "\"That is the biggest problem in our club in this moment because we are losing the feeling of we are a massive club and it's the end of the world to lose a game at home. I think that is the biggest concern in our club.\"",
      "Amorim said it is \"the most dangerous feeling that you have in a big club\" - one that is without a league title since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.",
      "Asked how it feels to see his side in 16th with two matches to go, the United head coach said: \"How a manager of Manchester United is supposed to feel in that position - embarrassed, and it's hard to accept.",
      "\"I think everybody has to think seriously about a lot of things here. Everybody is thinking about the final. The final is not an issue in this moment in our club.",

      "Winning the Premier League title is the ultimate definition of success - doing so with four games to play even more impressive. And Arne Slot has already defined Liverpool's summer as a success after signing Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah up to new deals.",
      "There was also a domestic final in the Carabao Cup, and a slender exit in the Champions League to PSG. They finished top of the league phase group, too, with time to spare.",
      "Surely but surely nobody can argue this is anything but a successful season.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",
      "But the slump that has followed has left Nuno Espirito Santo's side outside the top five. Failing to pick up a single point from back-to-back home fixtures against Everton and Brentford has led to a feeling of frustration at what could be a missed opportunity.",
      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",
      "It is still possible. Forest have won all 10 matches they have played against the bottom six so far and two more remain. Winning those against Leicester and West Ham would set up a showdown with Chelsea by the Trent on the final day. It could be very special indeed.Adam Bate",
      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",
      "Aside from their European tour, the strong and consistent form in the Premier League has given them a fighting chance of securing a top-five spot to build on those Champions League memories next season.",
      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",
      "Or, he will be a villain for presiding over what is set to be their worst Premier League campaign in history and would almost certainly leave the club.",
      "There is no middle ground here for the Australian.",
      "Europa League glory to end the infamous trophy drought and qualify for the Champions League, despite a potential club-record Premier League low finish, would be a successful season for Spurs.Declan Olley"

      "Champions League prize money increased by a third following the competition's revamp this season, making it all the more important for the Premier League teams vying to qualify.",
      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",
      "It's good news for clubs given the total prize pot for the Champions League, which this season expanded from 32 to 36 teams, is up to £2.06bn, compared to £1.74bn in the previous format last season.",
      "Every club that qualifies earns an automatic £15.7m - even if they lose every game and go out at the league phase.",
      "At that stage, every win earns a club £1.8m and a draw £590,000.",
      "For finishing in the top eight of the league phase, which seals automatic qualification to the round of 16, UEFA awards £1.7m to each team.",
      "Teams are also awarded £233,000 for each place in the league phase table, meaning Liverpool got £8.4m for finishing top, while Arsenal earned £7.9m for finishing third.",
      "UEFA then rewards teams for reaching each round of the knockout phase:",
      "Arsenal are therefore the biggest earners among the English clubs this season.",
      "Their run to the last four, where they were beaten by Paris Saint-Germain, earned them roughly £70m in prize money, and that is before factoring gate receipts and commercial revenues.",
      "The winner of the final between Paris-Saint Germain will earn close to £100m in prize money.",
      "For comparison, Manchester United received just £3.9m in prize money for winning the FA Cup last summer",
      "UEFA has also introduced a new \"value pillar\" of payments for the first time this season - which could be worth an additional £10.5m to clubs.",
      "This is a complicated bonus based on your club's historical success in Europe and how much your country pays for its broadcast rights to the Champions League.",
      "As we approach the end of the Premier League season, just seven points separate six teams fighting for the remaining places below champions Liverpool, whose place is already assured.",
      "Crucially, England's co-efficient score means the Premier League has five spots this season, rather than the usual four.",
      "Arsenal could clinch their place with victory over Liverpool on Super Sunday, with Man City, Newcastle and Chelsea currently occupying the other spots, and Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Five spots will become six now that both Tottenham and Manchester United have reached the Europa League final.",
      "Both sides are in the bottom half in the Premier League and not in the conversation for a top-five finish, but the Europa League winners earn qualification to the Champions League.",
      "An English Europa League winner does not mean the fifth-placed Premier League team lose their Champions League place."

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",

      "In an ideal world, without PSR restraints and the lure of playing European football being a necessity for most players, both clubs could just do with a season of Premier League focus.",

      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",

      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",

      "Man Utd beat Athletic Club 7-1 on aggregate in their Europa League semi-final to book their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21; Mason Mount scored twice, becoming the first United substitute to do so in a European knockout game since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
      "Tottenham await Man Utd in the Europa League final, which takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."
