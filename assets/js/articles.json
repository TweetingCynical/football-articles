      "Viktor Gyokeres has been the subject of non-stop speculation this summer as the striker continues to be linked with a transfer to Manchester United or Arsenal. The forward has caught the eye since joining Sporting CP two summers ago, where he has developed into one of the most clinical No. 9s in the world.",
      "Gyokeres’ incredible tally includes 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting on his way to winning two Primeira Liga titles. United have developed an interest in the 27-year-old, partly because of their need for a goal-scorer and partly because Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim was the man who brought the best out of Gyokeres when he signed him from Coventry City.",
      "Yet, they face fierce competition from Arsenal, who are in search of their own striker after being left with no recognised centre-forwards for the second half of last season. The Gunners have been negotiating deals for both the Swede and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko in the hope they can complete the transfer that offers the best value.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe delivered the bombshell news on Tuesday that Arsenal were on the verge of reaching a verbal agreement with the striker over personal terms. It was reported that the agreement would be a five-year deal.",
      "After negotiating at length for the Slovenian’s move again this summer, the deal is now seemingly on the backburner. It is Gyokeres, rather than Sesko, who looks to be Emirates-bound, despite suggestions that Arteta and his staff preferred the latter due to his younger age and experience playing in a tougher league.",
      "Another key character in the ongoing circus surrounding Gyokeres this summer has been Frederico Varandas. The outspoken Sporting president first took issue with a claim made by Gyokeres’ agent, who said he had a gentleman’s agreement in place whereby the club had promised to let the forward leave for a fee of £59m - considerably less than his £85m release clause.",
      "But Varandas has now handed Arsenal and United a potential boost by admitting there is a \"strong likelihood\" Gyokeres will leave the club this summer - and for a possible discounted fee - saying: \"Sporting is calm regarding this matter. Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyokeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "“However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.\"",
      "Hinting at a potential new price tag, he added: “Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m (euros). He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "“In recent weeks, we have been paying attention. I saw a player, [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go [potentially to Arsenal] for £55m, and I saw Matheus Cunha move to Manchester United for around £62.5m.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26 years old. I believe Viktor could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world, which I don’t believe, as his agent is one of the best in the world.”",
      "In another boost to both Arsenal and United’s hopes that Gyokeres will leave Sporting, the Portuguese champions now appear to be looking to replace him. The Lisbon club have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic in the past week.",
      "As reported by Germanijak.HR, Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian club’s valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt, plus teams in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for his side last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goal-scoring record for less than £30m may also help Arsenal and United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who has been vocal in his frustrations towards the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag until now.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Horseman, 41, will work alongside U21s manager Travis Binnion, who's been searching for a new assistant since Hughes became the boss of League Two side Newport County. In May, Bristol Rovers confirmed that the Englishman would be leaving the club following their relegation to the fourth tier.",
      "The previous campaign, Horseman spent just shy of six months in charge of Forest Green Rovers, winning only four games. Prior to that, the 41-year-old led Southampton's B team between 2019 and 2023.",
      "Wilcox, who formerly headed up Manchester City's academy, was recently promoted from his role as technical director to become the Red Devils' new director of football. His work at Old Trafford has earned praise from co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who ruthlessly sacked United's last sporting director, Dan Ashworth, after just five months.",
      "During an interview with the Times, Ratcliffe hailed: \"Jason, for me, is a guy at the coal face. He ran the academy at Manchester City. Txiki Begiristain, I know, thought Jason had the best eyes in the club.",
      "\"He's a warm character, he's got a sense of humour, he knows what he's talking about, he's got a really good relationship with Ruben [Amorim]. So, you know, if you compare that with last season when we had Erik [ten Hag] and John Murtough (United's former football director), it's chalk and cheese.\"",
      "Where will Manchester United finish next season? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Wilcox worked with United's CEO, Omar Berrada, while at City. His promotion reflected his increased responsibilities at Old Trafford, with Sir Dave Brailsford having decided to step back from his day-to-day involvement.",
      "During his playing career, Wilcox helped Blackburn Rovers win the Premier League title in 1995. He earned three senior caps for England before starting his coaching career with City in 2012.",
      "After five years working his way up, Wilcox was appointed their academy director. In 2023 following more than a decade for City, he made the move to Southampton."

      "Manchester United transfer target Ollie Watkins admitted that he was 'fuming' after being left out of the Aston Villa starting line-up in place of Marcus Rashford. Watkins, 29, was only a substitute for both of Villa's Champions League quarter-final clashes with Paris Saint-Germain last season.",
      "Now the England international could be team-mates with Rashford again. United are making a concerted effort to sign Watkins from Villa, who'd want around £60million.",
      "Unai Emery had taken a liking to Rashford after signing him on loan from United during the January transfer window and the Villa manager thought that he was better suited to starting against PSG. Villa ultimately went out, losing 5-4 on aggregate, and Rashford failed to score in either game.",
      "Watkins, meanwhile, was given just 25 minutes across the two legs, as he spent much of the contest on the bench. The striker couldn't hide his frustration in the days following Emery's decision and responded in the best way possible.",
      "\"I played 20 minutes against PSG in both games, so I'm not going to lie - I was fuming I wasn't playing,\" Watkins admitted. \"I let him know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision... Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger as motivation.\"",
      "Emery took ownership of his decision and explained: \"It was my selection, tactically. We are adding more competition, more matches and we are hitting another level. Of course, Watkins is very, very important for us. He's scoring goals for us, and last Saturday, his impact was fantastic.",
      "\"On Tuesday [against PSG], it was difficult for him to read the match and show his power. But he worked, he is ready. I am so, so happy with him, and I want to win tomorrow [away to Manchester City]. As players, they can be sad at not playing or angry at not playing - I prefer angry.\""

      "Manchester United are stepping up their interest in Aston Villa and England striker Ollie Watkins. United had hoped to land Sporting Lisbon forward Viktor Gyokeres, who played under Old Trafford boss Ruben Amorim in Portugal.",
      "But United are convinced Gyokeres has decided to join Arsenal ahead of them and have therefore switched their attention to 29-year-old Watkins. United are still struggling to strike a deal with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo and have decided to make a concerted effort to land Watkins.",
      "Watkins became unsettled last season after falling behind on-loan United striker Marcus Rashford in the second half of the campaign. With Villa having missed out on Champions League football on the final day of last season, losing 2-0 at United, Watkins is said to be open to a new challenge elsewhere.",
      "It is understood United have held tentative talks with Villa about signing Watkins, who Amorim sees as the ideal player to lead his attack - given his proven goal scoring prowess. Villa would want around £60million for Watkins, who has three years left on his contract, but United are unwilling to pay that much, given his age and lack of resale value.",
      "United were willing to offer Rashford as part of a swap deal involving Watkins, but Villa decided against signing the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan deal was up. One obstacle to United's pursuit of Watkins is their inability to offer European football, following their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "United also need to off-load the likes of Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to raise money to fund new signings. Watkins signed a new long-term contract with Villa in October 2023, keeping him at the club until 2028.",
      "But the England international wasn't a guaranteed starter last season, competing with Jhon Duran and later Rashford. Villa boss Unai Emery, however, is a big fan of Watkins.",
      "\"But even when he's not doing both, he's working for the team. Defensively, the commitment was always high. He is in the press to the opponent. His commitment and behaviour is always a very good example for others. His power is his mind. His mentality is the best quality he has.\""

Patrick Dorgu is currently the preferred choice in that position, and while Luke Shaw is a mainstay at Old Trafford, his recent spate of injuries means United might find themselves short-handed if they don't bring Leon into the first team.",

      "A former Manchester United coach claimed the club made “one of the biggest mistakes in football” by selling midfielder Scott McTominay.",
      "United sold McTominay to Italian side Napoli last summer, where the Scotland international was an instant hit, leading them to the Serie A title in his debut season.",
      "McTominay was Napoli's stand-out player in their title-winning campaign, became a cult hero with the club's fans and was voted Serie A Player of the Season.",
      "United sold McTominay to help them comply with profit and sustainability regulations, with his £25.7million fee counting as pure profit on the balance sheet due to his status as an academy player.",
      "But former United coach Benni McCarthy, who worked with McTominay under former boss Erik ten Hag, said it was a major error to sell the 28-year-old, given the form he has shown for Napoli.",
      "“Of course, there are different reasons why you sell homegrown players sometimes,”said McCarthy. “When they go, the profit lets you sign more players.",
      "“Having said that, it was one of the biggest mistakes in football to let him leave. He was born to play for United. Maybe he wasn’t the most technical, but he had fight, and I think it’s what they will get back with Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Scotty was a player that you look for in a dressing room to get you where you want to be. To let him go for what was a small transfer fee was a big shame. I think everyone at the club regrets that decision.”",
      "McCarthy, who left United last summer, also revealed he pushed for United to sign Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo, only for the club's scouting department to veto the move.",
      "“Gakpo was the one that we wanted the most and missed out on,” said McCarthy. “I think he was the first player that we sat down and discussed, and decided that he was the player who would fit in perfectly.",
      "“We knew we could play him alongside Marcus Rashford, when Rashy was really on song in 2022. I think we were so close to getting him. At one stage, it was ours to lose. The agent knew Erik and there were really good talks.",
      "“The manager asked me to write up a profile for the player and to take it to the scouting department, so they knew my opinion. I watched the player, I made my case for why he would be ideal.",
      "“He could play on the left, he could work as a false nine. With him and Rashford we’d have been strong down the middle and on the left.",
      "“Then I was told the scouting department had watched him numerous times and they didn’t rate him. They said the stats weren’t right. For me, with my experience, I know what you need to deliver at a special club.",
      "“You don’t need stats to tell you that. The naked eye gives you so much more than just stats. Obviously the club have a system, and the system won, so he joined Liverpool and won the league.”",

      "Timothy Weah is the third player United have been made aware is available to leave Juve. The winger was recently the subject of transfer interest from Nottingham Forest, however, Weah rejected a move to the City Ground.",

      "The Italian giants are understood to have no issues with paying a transfer fee for Sancho but it is the player's salary, reported to be a huge £250,000-a-week, which is proving to be a sticking point.",

      "The loan deal included an option for Villa to sign the United forward for £40million but it could've been very different had the swap with Watkins came to fruition. The 29-year-old was reportedly available for transfer in January, even being offered to Arsenal.",
      "According to the Athletic, United held discussions with Villa about signing Watkins at the end of the season. The Red Devils have now made a fresh enquiry separate to Rashford, who Villa won't be signing permanently.",
      "Amorim wants to sign a new striker and Watkins has emerged a target, with Rashford having returned to Old Trafford but appearing to have no future at United. Villa, meanwhile, are currently grappling with Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules and it's claimed that they need to make one lucrative sale in order to avoid punishment.",
      "It's been speculated that Villa Park chiefs could follow Chelsea's example and sell their women's team in what would be a controversial move. Selling Watkins would also cause outcry, with Villa already letting one striker leave in the January transfer window before narrowly missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "Unai Emery's side sanctioned the departure of Jhon Duran to Saudi Arabian side Al-Nassr for a cool £65million. Duran's departure didn't mean that Watkins was always first-choice for Emery, though.",
      "\"I let him (Emery) know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision... Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger as motivation.\"",
      "The England international would almost certainly start most games for the Red Devils, as he's significantly more Premier League-proven compared to United strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee. Last season, Watkins bagged 17 goals and laid on 14 assists."

Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, after falling out of favour with Amorim over the forward's perceived lack of focus and application in training.",
      "Villa declined to take up an option to sign Rashford for £40million at the end of the loan agreement, leaving the 27-year-old facing an awkward return to United next week to start pre-season.

      "Fenerbahce was suggested as a potential destination for Sancho and a move to Turkey would confirm his spectacular fall from grace.",
      "Juventus would clearly be a more appealing option. The Italian side are not the force of years past, but they remain a huge European club and Turin is an attractive city for footballers.",
      "And reports have claimed Juventus are interested in signing Sancho on a permanent basis, and they are open to negotiating a swap deal involving a few players from their dressing room.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic, Timothy Weah and Douglas Luiz have been named as potential makeweights in a deal, although it would only make sense for United to consider Vlahovic and Luiz.",
      "Weah plays on the right wing and Ruben Amorim does not need another player in that position. Weah is also not good enough for United. On the other hand, Vlahovic is a striker and central midfielder Luiz impressed when he played in the Premier League for Aston Villa.",
      "Vlahovic was tipped to become one of Europe's finest goalscorers when he signed for Juventus in 2022, but the Serbian hasn't quite lived up to expectations, despite having a respectable record in front of goal.",
      "He would still provide more value at Old Trafford than Sancho and would offer a presence at the focal point of the attack, which has been a problem with Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Vlahovic would not be a hugely exciting signing, but fans wouldn't turn their noses up if he arrived as part of a swap deal for Sancho, whose time in Manchester has been up since September 2023.",
      "A potential deal with Juventus would be a relatively straightforward solution, killing two birds with one stone - bringing in a striker to strengthen the attack and getting rid of Sancho.",
      "If a swap deal did materialise, though, perhaps it would be logical for Luiz to be included, not Vlahovic, because United also need a player in that position after a mixed first season for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "United are targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League next term, so can they achieve that with Ugarte and Bruno Fernandes starting the majority of games in midfield? It feels unlikely.",
      "Ugarte delivered hit-and-miss performances during his debut season in Manchester and Luiz could be an upgrade. The Brazilian contributed 10 goals and 10 assists in 2023/24 for Aston Villa and Villa Park chiefs only sanctioned his move to Juventus to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Luiz is a box-to-box midfielder and could be the ideal foil for Fernandes. He would be able to offer adequate defensive cover and the kind of energy that Amorim wants from his players.",
      "United need to get rid of Sancho, who has another year remaining on his contract, and a potential swap deal with Juventus would tick a lot of boxes if the right deal structure could be agreed.",
      "Vlahovic and Luiz are certainly not deadwood and could be valuable additions. Getting Sancho off the books at the same time would make a lot of sense."

      "Far too often, we see examples of players taking matters into their own hands and attempting to force a move away from a club.",
      "Take Antony, for example. He is by no means the only player to have adopted such a strategy, but his refusal to train or play for Ajax prior to his move to United in 2022 was a red flag before he had even stepped foot inside Old Trafford.",
      "United were said to have been impressed by the \"attitude\" Antony had shown to sign for the club, but there was nothing impressive about it.",
      "He would apologise just days later, insisting he was sorry if he had \"failed\" the fans. Attitude is as important as ability when it comes to representing a club of United's stature, and you can tell a lot about a player from the manner of their exit from a club.",

      "But goading a Championship team, having thrown away a three-goal lead and scraped past them in an FA Cup semi-final on penalties, and showboating against FC Sheriff with the score locked at 0-0 aren't examples of the attitude needed to play for a club like Manchester United.",
      "Brentford know there is a deal to be done for Mbeumo and they are well within their rights to hold firm until their valuation is met. The ball is in United's court on that front.",

      "When new signings arrive, fans often focus on the big details - transfer fees, wages, and where they’ll fit on the pitch. But one thing that can get overlooked is shirt numbers, and at Manchester United, that can be a pretty big deal.",
      "The number a player wears may seem like just a digit stitched onto a kit, but at a club like United, it carries serious weight. Think of the famous No.7 shirt worn by legends such as Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and Eric Cantona. It's not just a number, it’s a legacy.",
      "This summer, with new signings expected and some players set to leave, a few of United’s iconic squad numbers could be available once again.",
      "The No.1 shirt could be one to go. Andre Onana has struggled since his arrival in 2023, with several high-profile errors costing United in key moments.",
      "Then there’s the No.2 shirt. Most famously worn by former captain Gary Neville, the number is now vacant following Victor Lindelof’s exit. Traditionally a full-back’s number, Lindelof wore it in central defence, and whoever comes in could redefine it again.",
      "Further up the pitch, there are questions about Mason Mount and the No.7 shirt. The former Chelsea man was handed the iconic number when he signed for £60m, but injuries and form have held him back.",
      "With just four goals across two seasons, some are questioning whether he’s lived up to the number’s legacy. Compare that to Cristiano Ronaldo’s 118-goal haul in his first United stint, and it's easy to see the pressure.",
      "The attacking trio of No.9, No.10 and No.11 could also see change. Rasmus Hojlund, No.9, has shown flashes of promise but may leave on loan with Inter Milan reportedly keen on a permanent deal instead.",
      "Marcus Rashford, No.10, iconically worn by Wayne Rooney, continues to hint at a move to Barcelona, while Bayern Munich are also interested. Meanwhile, Joshua Zirkzee, No.11, hasn’t quite cemented his place, despite an okay season with seven goals and two assists.",
      "If any of these United players are to leave the club, the question will be who will take their spot, and can they live up to their number."

      "Last term, a 15th-placed Premier League finish was as sore as it gets for United, but shifting from one manager to the next involved a level of acceptance of teething problems. What was made obvious was deficiencies in attack, as only four other top-flight teams scored less than Amorim's men with 38 matches played.",
      "This is what prompted the swift payment of Matheus Cunha's £62.5m release clause from Wolves. The scorer of 17 goals in all 2024/25 competitions became the first signing of the summer.",
      "Next on the hit list is Bryan Mbeumo, with his desire to move to Old Trafford well documented as a deal is discussed with Brentford.",
      "And from there it is still a rather open book with two months of the summer left to play out. What is certain is that alongside other additions to Amorim's attack, outgoings will be a necessity.",
      "Mbeumo, naturally a right-sided attacker, would help Amad cover what is needed on that flank but also has shown ability at Brentford to play centrally as required.",
      "This can be partially offset by the permanent sale of Antony either now or later down the line, with the possibility of another loan an option as a last-ditch scenario.",
      "Cunha is a central-minded attacker, as is Ollie Watkins who is now being linked with the move to United in the wake of Viktor Gyokeres' saga. The club have reportedly accepted defeat in the race for Amorim's former striker at Sporting CP, so could instead turn to their rivals.",
      "Watkins' record speaks for itself - 87 goals and 42 assists in 223 Villa appearances - as one of England's current deadliest finishers. The only attribute against him is age as he is 29, but it is not as if United are in a position to be picky if they want to slowly but surely recover their place at the top of English football.",
      "The sale of striker Rasmus Hojlund will help free up funds and further space for the Watkins transfer, but that is not close to completion yet. Joshua Zirkzee could then be kept as cover, with 17-year-old Chido Obi also another who can be kept on the fringes of the senior squad and handed opportunities as appropriate.",

His spritely play helped the French club take a 4-2 lead on the night, only for United to muster three goals out of nothing in the closing stages and advance.",
      "The 20-year-old is not close to making any move at this point in time, it is said, and as a long-term prospect not many talents in Europe have proven themselves as Fofana has done already in his young career. United could swoop in to complete their business.",

I think our position is he had an unbelievable season last year and we expected interest in him. If that deal is right, then there's a deal to do, but if not, then he'll stay.\"",
      "Giles was asked about conversations regarding Mbeumo staying at Brentford and responded: \"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he is going to depart this summer.",
      "\"There is interest. He had a great season last season, so the interest is inevitable. If we get the right offer, there is potentially a deal to be done, but there's only so much we can say on that.\"",

      "Giles added Mbeumo would only be sold if it was \"the right deal\" for Brentford. \"Any club will tell you that,\" he said. \"If it's not right deal, why would we do it? He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There's no harm in keeping your best players.\"",
      "The interviews caused a stir on social media, but Giles was never going to publicly say there was no chance of Mbeumo staying at Brentford because that would damage their bargaining power.",
      "It would also not be true. There is a small chance that Mbeumo stays in London because anything can happen in the transfer market, although it's far likelier he leaves and gets his wish of a summer switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Giles was doing his job and protecting Brentford's negotiating power in the interviews earlier in the week and his comments won't worry United, who have tabled two bids for Mbeumo.",
      "United recently submitted an improved bid in excess of £60million for Mbeumo, but that fell short of Brentford's valuation and talks are continuing between the two clubs to find a compromise.",
      "Some supporters have suggested United should walk away from the deal, believing Brentford are trying to rinse the club dry. However, an agreement should be close at this stage of talks.",
      "United have overpaid for players in the past and are trying to improve their reputation in the market, but Mbeumo is a Premier League-proven player and should be worth haggling for."

Villa would demand around £60million for Watkins, who has three years remaining on his contract, but United are reluctant to meet this valuation due to his age and limited resale value.",
      "United had reportedly proposed including Rashford in a swap deal for Watkins, but Villa declined the opportunity to sign the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan period ended. A potential stumbling block in United's pursuit of Watkins is their inability to offer European football, following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May, reports the Mirror.",
      "United are looking to offload Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, and Antony in an effort to raise funds for new signings. Watkins, who penned a new long-term deal with Villa in October 2023 extending his stay until 2028, faced competition last season from the likes of Jhon Duran and later Rashford, but wasn't always a first-choice starter.",
      "\"But even when he's not doing both, he's working for the team. Defensively, the commitment was always high.",
      "\"He is in the press to the opponent. His commitment and behaviour is always a very good example for others. His power is his mind. His mentality is the best quality he has.\""

      "United are keen to add at least one striker to their ranks this summer and Sporting's Gyokeres has been heavily linked with Old Trafford. Head coach Ruben Amorim signed the Swede from Coventry City in 2023 and managed to forge him into a prolific striker in Portugal before exiting the club in November 2024.",

      "However, it appears the race for Gyokeres could have been run. Along with United, Arsenal have been heavily invested in the Swede and their interest dates back further than the Reds.",
      "Like Amorim, Mikel Arteta has been keen to strengthen his attack having been left with no recognised centre-forwards for large parts of the second portion of the season. According to L'Equipe, the Gunners are closing in on rectifying that as they near a verbal agreement with Gyokeres' team over personal terms for the striker.",

      "Leon does have an opportunity to be an option on the left flank this season. Patrick Dorgu is the first choice on that side and while Luke Shaw is a mainstay at Old Trafford, his recent injury record means United could find themselves short if they do not integrate Leon into the first-team.",
      "The 18-year-old's first chance to impress in a match will be on July 19 when the Reds travel to Stockholm to face Leeds in pre-season.

Not all of these appearances were starts either with the forward sharing the starting spot with Jhon Duran and Marcus Rashford.",
      "After Watkins entered the list of players to watch this summer, MEN Sport has rounded up the latest information regarding the England international and a move to Old Trafford.",

      "The forward is 29 so the amount of resale value is limited for the Reds. However, with three years remaining on his deal at Villa Park, Unai Emery will be unwilling to budge on that valuation.",
      "The dilemma for United is whether a proven goalscorer in the top flight is worth paying that bit extra for.",
      "It has been well documented that Villa have been looking nervously over their shoulder regarding Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) concerns. To avoid falling foul of those rules, it was reported that Villa may look to sell some of their big name players including Watkins and Emiliano Martinez.",
      "However, The Telegraph reports that Villa are expected to raise around £55m after selling their women's team. This deal could stop the West Midlands club from needing to sell their top assets or bend to the negotiations of United - and could therefore keep his price tag relatively high.",

In an ideal world, Viktor Gyokeres would have been the striker who joined United this summer; Ruben Amorim trusts him, he's prolific in front of goal and he fits the 3-4-2-1 system perfectly.",
      "However, this dream scenario looks to be just that after the news that was reported on Tuesday night. Journalist Sacha Tavolieri understands that Arsenal have agreed a five-year deal with Gyokeres' camp and have now turned their attention to negotiations with Sporting CP regarding a transfer fee.",
      "While that transfer is not fully confirmed, at least yet, it seems like United are further away then ever before from completing a deal for the Swede. As such, it's now time for the Reds to take drastic action.",
      "Before it became clear that a swoop for Gyokeres would be difficult, there were few options on the market to fill that centre-forward void at Old Trafford. Such strikers are like goldust these days and United need to work quickly to add one to their squad.",
      "Amad, Bruno Fernandes and Joshua Zirkzee have all shown that they can perform in that position and considering that the Cameroon international is willing to hold out for the Reds, surely the focus can change. Osimhen is said to be available for £64million this summer; both the Nigerian and Napoli want him to be sold.",
      "He has already rejected a move to Al-Hilal as he sees his future in Europe. Galatasaray are super keen on returning Osimhen to Istanbul but, surely, if United come knocking, the 26-year-old would prioritise the Reds.",
      "Concerns over Osimhen's wage demands are believed to be putting off a lot of clubs this summer, but if it was all about the money for the Napoli star, then he would have shook hands with Al Hilal. Ultimately, Ineos need to be aware that there are limited options for them in the centre-forward market and with Gyokeres, seemingly, off the table, perhaps it's now time for them to make a drastic detour - to avoid being left behind."

      "Arsenal and Aston Villa know they could cut out the negotiating middle man for many of their targets, who happen to come with tempting release clauses.",
      "This is an inexhaustive list of players with release clauses which could actually viably be triggered from summer 2025 onwards. We are talking sub-£100m, not your daft £1bn La Liga jobs.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "But Leeds, West Ham and a handful of others are yet to act on their interest, perhaps because of his wage demands and obvious curse.",
      "",
      "Vanja Milinkovic-Savic\nIf Chelsea or Manchester City act on their apparent £16.7m interest in the Torino keeper and brother of Sergej then expect every other Ruben Amorim press conference to be spent explaining why no-one currently at Manchester United should really be blamed for releasing a teenager who couldn’t get a work permit in 2015.",
      "He is 6ft 8ins so that’s something. But also it sounds like he’s off to Napoli.",
      "",
      "Edmond Tapsoba\nNewcastle are said to have offered £50m for Bayer Leverkusen defender Tapsoba; it is unknown whether or not they realise it might take as much as £80m.",
      "",
      "Castello Lukeba\nAn eclectic cast of Liverpool, Spurs and Bayern Munich have been mentioned in discussions over Lukeba’s future, with a suggestion that Leipzig might not necessarily hold out for the French centre-half’s entire £77.8m release clause.",
      "",
      "Ousmane Diomande\nCrystal Palace have already identified their replacement for Marc Guehi, whether the captain leaves this summer or not. And they will not be paying £69.1m for the Sporting centre-half either.",
      "",
      "Miguel Gutierrez\nA whole host of clubs like the look of Girona left-back Gutierrez at £30.2m – he was once described as a ‘priority signing’ for Liverpool and Manchester United are known to be lurking – but any hopeful negotiators will have to deal with about 427 clauses Real Madrid still hold over him.",
      "",
      "Jhon Lucumi\nAston Villa and Bournemouth are sniffing around Bologna defender Lucumi, with Roma also contemplating a move for the 26-year-old who will only come as cheap as £23.9m until July 10.",
      "",
      "Enzo Boyomo\nAston Villa and Crystal Palace are known admirers of Osasuna centre-half Boyomo, who has been crucial for a side he only joined a year ago.",
      "Boyomo stayed at Real Valladolid for just one campaign too before moving to Pamplona; whoever triggers his £21m release clause might expect to keep him for a little longer.",
      "",
      "Kevin Lomonaco\n“I really like the Premier League. It’s what I watch the most. I like West Ham,” should raise an absurd number of red flags within the departments of any and all clubs charged with scrutinising the character and even sanity of 23-year-old Lomonaco.",
      "The centre-half has attracted interest from the Hammers, Crystal Palace, Sevilla and Wolfsburg in his £16.7m release clause.",
      "",
      "Jan Bednarek\nAny club desperate to sign a centre-half with two recent relegations on his CV can do so for the cheap old price of £6m.",
      "",
      "Martin Zubimendi\nIt is practically certain that Arsenal have wrapped up a £50.1m deal for Zubimendi early and avoided all those awkward Didn’t Want Him Anyway hoops Liverpool forced themselves to jump through last summer. But they could start bottling transfers instead of just titles to put the Real Sociedad lifer back on the market.",
      "",
      "Eberechi Eze\nCrystal Palace averted the potential crisis of having both Eze and Michael Olise’s release clauses triggered in the same summer but the fine print in the former’s deal will be reactivated in the summer. There will be no shortage of potential suitors at £68m.",
      "",
      "Nico Williams\nAndrea Berta might have taken up the easiest post in world football considering Arsenal are pursuing yet another player whose valuation is certain.",
      "The sporting director just needs to fill in the gaps of persuading Williams that a £48.4m move to north London is in his best interests, but more pertinently to convince the club’s hierarchy that the finances involved are worth it.",
      "By all accounts it is a battle he has conceded, leaving Barcelona to agree personal terms before overcoming the obstacle of working out how they are actually going to pay for him.",
      "",
      "Wilfred Ndidi\nThere is unlikely to be a massive rush to bring in Ndidi after his second relegation in three year with Leicester, but the 28-year-old is on the radar of Crystal Palace, Everton and Fulham for £9m and it does feel as though a more stable environment would benefit him.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\nAnother Arsenal target – to the chagrin of many supporters – but really any aspiring team in world football will have at least taken a look at Gyokeres before wincing ever so slightly at that £86m release clause.",
      "Sporting might not hold out for that much but are among the best sellers across the globe and will back themselves to get the best possible deal.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus\nAfter this season especially, it feels unlikely that any club will meet the £85m release clause written into the West Ham contract of Kudus. It is even higher for Saudi Arabian clubs, who do indeed have their limits.",
      "As it is, the Hammers are desperate enough for cash that the asking price might come down a good £25m or so.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA record of 28 goals and five assists in 32 games for Galatasaray can be disregarded through the Turkish Super Lig rule of transfers but his age, affordability (£62.5m) relative to other strikers on the market and undoubted pedigree in Serie A cannot. Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",
      "",
      "Benjamin Sesko\nThere is some debate as to the exact numbers which would compel Leipzig to countenance the sale of Sesko – £62m is the strongest recent claim – but less doubt about whether his record of 35 goals in 79 appearances in Germany is worth the risk on a 21-year-old.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean\nEverton might not get involved but after scoring 23 goals in 42 games this season, Kean could repay the faith shown in him by Fiorentina with another big move. For two weeks from the start of July the Manchester United target is available for as little as £45m.",
      "",
      "Thierno Barry\nAn option for Everton in their brave new era under David Moyes, it will be interesting to see if the Toffees can find the requisite £34m to bring 22-year-old centre-forward Barry in from Villarreal, for whom he has scored 11 goals in 37 games.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola\nBournemouth quietly fell off towards the end of the season to bring their dream of European qualification combined with FA Cup glory crashing back down to reality. But they will not waver in their determination to extend Iraola’s contract – and perhaps even remove that £10m release clause. Spurs have at least removed themselves from the equation.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has reportedly made the ‘decision’ to cut ‘ties’ to Sporting Lisbon and Portugal amid interest from Arsenal and Manchester United.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed what Arsenal need to do next as they pursue Viktor Gyokeres amid claims of a ‘contract agreement’.",
      "Arsenal are closing in on Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres, with the Swede keen on the move and a long-term contract already ‘agreed’.",
      "Arsenal could sign Viktor Gyokeres today for €60m (£51m) despite comments from the Sporting CP president, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s moves for three strikers worth around £218m combined have been ruled out for three reasons.",
      "Top Arsenal target Viktor Gyokeres fears that Sporting CP are going to cost him a move to the Emirates Stadium this summer, according to reports."

      "A Tottenham target has told Liverpool he wants to move to Anfield, while Manchester United want one of PSG’s key midfielders…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Kudus’s agents have told Liverpool he would accept a pay cut to move to Anfield. The Ghanaian newly-appointed representatives initiated contact, and though we know Liverpool liked Kudus, this is coming from the player’s side, not the club.",
      "",
      "19) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Arsenal\nFrom BILD, Arsenal have joined the race for the France striker, which suits Eintracht Frankfurt just fine. While they’re insisting on £85million, they need the market to look as busy as they can make it appear. And it does Arsenal no harm while they continue to barter with other clubs over other strikers.",
      "",
      "18) Fabian Ruiz – PSG to Manchester United\nUnited are said to have offered £43million for the Spain midfielder, but even though he has only two years left on his contract, it is hard to envisage PSG rolling over to allow one of Luis Enrique’s starters to leave on the cheap.",
      "",
      "17) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. A Watkins-Marcus Rashford swap seems awfully convenient for all concerned…",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "",
      "15) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "14) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Kudus might prefer Liverpool, but staying in London seems far more likely.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "12) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Bayern Munich\nWhen you scratch the surface of the reports of Bayern’s interest, it seems Rashford makes only their ‘longlist’ of targets. And it seems a similar story at Barcelona. So if Rashford is to get his big move to a European club in contention for titles, it almost certainly won’t be until late in the window by which time United will have been backed into a corner.",
      "",
      "11) Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo, but Madueke has already been the subject of a bid, apparently.",
      "",
      "10) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "9) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "8) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "7) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…",
      "at long last, the midfielder was in London a week ago to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "“At one stage, it was ours to lose. The agent knew Erik, and there were really good talks. The manager asked me to write up a profile for the player and to take it to the scouting department, so they knew my opinion.",
      "“I watched the player, I made my case for why he would be ideal. He could play on the left, he could work as a false nine. With him and Rashford we’d have been strong down the middle and on the left. Then you had Alejandro Garnacho coming through, and we wanted to play him down the right. It would have been perfect.”",
      "However, McCarthy claims United’s scouts were not in favour of the signing as they “didn’t rate” Gakpo.",
      "“Then I was told the scouting department had watched him numerous times and they didn’t rate him. They said the stats weren’t right,” McCarthy added.",
      "“For me, with my experience, I know what you need to deliver at a special club. You don’t need stats to tell you that. The naked eye gives you so much more than just stats.",

      "Man Utd are responsible for four of the most expensive signings ever of players between the ages of 13 and 36; they later released two of them.",
      "",
      "13 – Camden Schaper (£700,000, Blackburn to Chelsea in July 2025)\nThe previous record was set by Finley Burns, who moved to Manchester City for £250,000 in January 2017. But that was blown out of the water by the fee Chelsea handed over for a ludicrous attacking midfield talent Etihad chiefs were inevitably eyeing too.",
      "Schaper and his family should probably start researching Strasbourg now.",
      "",
      "14 – Sheyi Ojo (£2m, MK Dons to Liverpool in November 2011)\nAfter playing for the U18s and training with the first team, Ojo attracted intense interest from Chelsea and Liverpool but it was the latter who won out. He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",
      "",
      "17 – Jude Bellingham (£25m, Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund in July 2020)\nA total of 44 first-team appearances for Championship side Birmingham was enough to tempt Bundesliga giants and professional stepping stone Borussia Dortmund into signing Bellingham; none of the parties involved will have any regrets.",
      "",
      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",
      "",
      "19 – Kylian Mbappe (£166m, Monaco to PSG in June 2018)\nThe most expensive teenager in the world and it is not particularly close; Joao Felix joined Atletico Madrid at the same age for £113m, while Bellingham’s move to Real Madrid could cost a couple million more than that with add-ons. The ridiculous Mbappe became PSG’s record scorer before leaving.",
      "",
      "20 – Ousmane Dembele (£135.5m, Borussia Dortmund to Barcelona in August 2017)\nBarcelona were right to sense there was a ridiculously good player there; how unfortunate the potential has only been realised at PSG.",
      "",
      "21 – Moises Caicedo (£100m, Brighton to Chelsea in August 2023)\nBrighton did what Brighton do and held out long enough for Liverpool and Chelsea to walk into a blindfolded blinking contest, with Caicedo ultimately making the decision by turning down a British record £111m move to the former in favour of a potential £115m switch to the latter.",
      "",
      "22 – Enzo Fernandez (£106.8m, Benfica to Chelsea in February 2023)\nThe £10m move from River Plate to Benfica in June 2022 did not make Fernandez the most expensive 22-year-old footballer in history, but his next transfer a few months later as a world champion certainly did.",
      "If Florian Wirtz activates a fair amount of the £16m add-ons in his £100m Liverpool move, this place will be his.",
      "",
      "23 – Paul Pogba (£93.8m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2016)\nLeft for free at 19. Moved for world-record fee at 23. Left to join previous club – again for free – at 29. And only once did Pogba achieve what Graeme Souness “expected” of him.",
      "",
      "24 – Declan Rice (£100m, West Ham to Arsenal in July 2023)\nArsenal will not mind if Rice enjoys similar success to the last individual who proudly held the title of world’s most expensive 24-year-old footballer. Gareth Bale did just fine and the Gunners believe their new record signing could be one of the many jigsaw pieces.",
      "",
      "25 – Neymar (£198m, Barcelona to PSG in August 2017)\nOh look, it’s the transfer that broke football.",
      "",
      "26 – Harry Maguire (£80m, Leicester to Man Utd in August 2019)\nNot only did Maguire usurp Virgil van Dijk as the most expensive defender ever, he replaced him as the most expensive 26-year-old in history. That really does have to sting. The former Man Utd captain might consider himself to at least be in the same conversation now, if only just listening in the background and awkwardly laughing at all the in-jokes while being hawked around for about a quarter of what he was signed for.",
      "",
      "27 – Luis Suarez (£65m, Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2014)\nAfter arriving with a customary months-long ban for biting, Suarez really did crack on establishing a phenomenal Barcelona legacy. The only player not named Lionel or Cristiano to win the Pichichi Trophy for La Liga top scorer between 2010 and 2021, Suarez also claimed 13 trophies and a place at number three on the Blaugrana’s list of all-time top scorers. Then when they let the Uruguayan go for free he fired Atletico to the title while fuelled on pure thirst for revenge.",
      "",
      "28 – Eden Hazard (£143m, Chelsea to Real Madrid in July 2019)\nIf you had told Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 that Hazard would activate all the clauses in his Chelsea transfer to take it from an £88.5m deal to the full value of £143m, they would presumably have been chuffed at the success the Belgian must have enjoyed. But those add-ons were accidentally triggered across four seasons utterly ruined by injury, before being released with 12 months of his contract remaining and then retiring.",
      "",
      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",
      "",
      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, and they have form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has decided who he ‘wants’ to manage Al-Nassr and they have ‘said yes’ to the move.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona legend Lionel Messi has been ‘offered a blockbuster’ transfer and he has made a decision on his ‘priority’.",
      "Including Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe (but not Lionel Messi), here are the top 10 highest earners in world football.",
      "Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a new contract at Al Nassr and will remain in the Saudi Pro League until he’s 42 years of age.",
      "Lionel Messi spoke openly about his rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo, revealing they aren’t friends but share great respect."

      "23) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "22) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "21) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "20) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "19) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "18) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "17) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "15) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",

Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",

      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",

      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",

      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",

      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",

      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "According to reports, six Manchester City stars are on the ‘chopping block’ after the Club World Cup, with the ‘most high-profile’ exit ‘almost certain’.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out."

      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "According to reports, one FC Barcelona star has ‘decided to leave’ after being ‘ordered’ to depart the club amid interest from Manchester United.",
      "So far this summer, Man Utd have only made one summer signing, spending around £62.5m to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves after activating his release clause.",
      "While the Red Devils need to offload valuable assets to raise funds, they are continuing work on overhauling Ruben Amorim’s squad as they are prioritising attacking upgrades.",
      "United appear to be furthest along in their pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo, but a new striker is another priority after they failed to sign Chelsea newbie Liam Delap earlier this summer.",
      "In an ideal world, United would also target upgrades in other positions this summer after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "Man Utd could pursue a centre-back to fill the void left by Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof amid interest in Barcelona star Ronald Araujo.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool offered Kudus, Man Utd submit PSG bid",
      "At the start of this year, 26-year-old Araujo penned a long-term contract extension until 2031 as his previous deal was due to expire in 2026.",
      "Despite this, Araujo’s future at Barcelona is in doubt after he was criticised for his decline in form last season, with reports indicating he’s been earmarked by club chiefs as a player to cash in on to fund their deal for Nico Williams.",
      "Last week, a report claimed Man Utd’s ‘offer’ for Araujo has ‘arrived’, though he is also attracting interest from Juventus and Bayern Munich.",
      "It has previously been suggested that the Uruguay international is against a move elsewhere, but a new report in Spain claims he has performed a U-turn, ‘deciding to leave’ as he’s ‘accepted orders’ from Barcelona’s hierarchy to do so.",
      "This stance allows Barcelona to ‘solve one of their most worrying issues’ as they need a ‘significant sale’ to sign and ‘register’ him ‘without any problems’.",
      "A club is yet to meet Barcelona’s 60 million euro asking price, but Araujo’s U-turn removes a major stumbling block for this ‘sacrifice’ and a move to the Premier League is considered most likely at this stage.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Barça is breathing easier and hopes that Araújo’s future can be resolved in the coming weeks, and that all parties involved will be satisfied.",
      "‘He has already begun to be offered to various clubs, and may end up in the Premier League, where he has the most admirers.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an ‘offer’ after ‘joining’ two European giants in the race to sign a Barcelona star.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would sanction Marcus Rashford’s move to FC Barcelona, but they want a player in return.",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola has reportedly urged the Citizens hierarchy to halt negotiations over a potential transfer for Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo.",
      "Man Utd have asked Barcelona for a specific player in exchange for Marcus Rashford in order to complete a transfer this summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd could become Barcelona’s ‘unexpected ally’ this summer as the Red Devils plan a double swoop which would see the Catalans add close to £60m to their coffers.",
      "Man Utd will make an offer to bring Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo to Old Trafford if they qualify for the Champions League, according to reports."

      "There is Arsenal panic over Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool irritation at miserly owners refusing to pay out for Alexander Isak, but these deals are done late.",
      "That is, of course, an entirely facetious outlook: both Arsenal and Liverpool supporters are renowned for their patience and understanding when it comes to such things as transfers, underground conspiracies designed specifically to hold back their clubs from the otherwise total global domination they would be able to impose if Stockley Park and FIFA didn’t exist, and generally any other mild to negligible setback in day-to-day life.",
      "Arsenal approaching this summer with a calm focus, securing a fine back-up keeper, putting in place a £51m deal for a wonderful midfielder well in advance, cutting through the noise to choose between two centre-forward targets instead of rushing into increasingly expensive negotiations and engaging on other potential options has been received well by fans willing to name their first-borns David Ornstein.",
      "Liverpool owners FSG slightly undermined accusations of parsimony by orchestrating the biggest single-window transfer spend in the club’s entire history before June was over, including a potential British record deal, with the promise of more to come.",
      "But even so, the lack of Isak immediately renders their Premier League title defence an unmitigated disaster.",
      "There are substantial signings in the works elsewhere – your Bryan Mbeumo to Manchester United, your Antony Elanga to Newcastle, the teenage South American wide forward or Brighton player to Chelsea – but often lost among the rumours is the fact that the more expensive deals are typically done late.",
      "It makes perfect sense: the bigger transfers in terms of cost can be more delicate to structure properly, with both clubs involved but also any intermediaries trying to secure the best possible deal for themselves. These talks take time and cannot really be rushed.",
      "Only one of the 15 most expensive summer signings in Premier League history was completed before mid-July – and that was Liverpool’s capture of Florian Wirtz a couple of weeks ago.",
      "It is even quite rare that they are agreed in July; these deals are almost as often sorted as late as September, but are normally done around August.",
      "There was a slight Club World Cup-shaped caveat this summer with the advent of a second transfer window making this a uniquely protracted period for player trading, but Wirtz was a stark exception to the rule that the biggest signings take the longest time and provide the largest obstacles to overcome.",
      "",
      "Florian Wirtz to Liverpool (£100m rising to £116m) – June 20\nLiverpool sought permission to speak to Wirtz in March. The German told Leverkusen of his desire to leave in May. Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Real Madrid had been meticulously removed from the equation well before his smooth signing in June.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ three Juventus stars as the Serie A giants eye Jadon Sancho in a ‘swap’ deal.",
      "The England international is coming off a mixed loan spell at Chelsea, who decided against signing him permanently for around £25m.",
      "Sancho scored in Chelsea’s Europa Conference League final win against Real Betis, but his inconsistent form prompted the Blues to pay a reported £5m penalty fee to opt out of a permanent deal.",
      "The 25-year-old remains on the exit ramp at Man Utd, who are looking to offload him to free up funds for signings. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony are in the same boat, but the Red Devils are yet to receive a suitable proposal for any player.",
      "Sancho’s Man Utd career has never got going as he’s failed to live up to his £73m price tag, with his fallout with former boss Erik ten Hag in September 2023 making matters worse.",
      "The winger returned to Dortmund on loan in January 2024 and had a successful spell as they reached the Champions League final.",
      "Dortmund were among the clubs interested in Sancho during the 2024 summer window before he joined Chelsea, with Juventus also mooted as a potential destination.",
      "READ: ‘Man Utd tax’ means Reds are doomed whatever they do in transfer market",
      "Juventus remain linked with Sancho, who has also attracted interest from Napoli and Fenerbahce this summer.",
      "However, Man Utd are struggling to offload Sancho due to their £25m valuation and his huge salary, so they may be forced to accept a loan bid for their outcast.",
      "Alternatively, United could pursue a swap deal and this prospect is on the table, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "In a report for GiveMeSport, Romano claims Juventus have ‘offered’ a ‘trio’ of stars to Man Utd as they look for a breakthrough for Sancho.",
      "It is noted that the former Aston Villa midfielder Douglas Luiz was ‘brought up’ amid talks over Antony, while Dusan Vlahovic and Tim Weah are ‘also available’ and have been mentioned as part of the Sancho ‘swap’ conversations.",
      "Regarding Man Utd’s stance on this proposal and the ‘main stumbling block’ for Sancho, Romano added:",
      "‘Dusan Vlahovic and Tim Weah are also available on the market this summer and are considered for sale by Juventus; Manchester United have been informed about that, but they didn’t proceed with any advanced contact at this stage – only being proposed this opportunity while talking about Sancho.",
      "‘Several scenarios are available on the table including the trio with Juventus interested in Sancho but also not keen on paying his whole salary; no issues on the transfer fee, but Juve don’t want to cover 100% of Sancho’s current salary. This remains the main stumbling block as of today. More will follow, very soon…’",
      "Man Utd are hoping to bring Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic to Old Trafford this summer, and it seems the Serbian striker has revealed his stance.",
      "Man Utd are ready to rival Leeds off the pitch once the PSR deadline passes, with the two clubs interested in a former Premier League player.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is off after Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho decided to pull the plug on the deal.",
      "According to reports, one ‘huge problem’ is threatening Manchester United’s hopes of offloading Jadon Sancho, with two clubs interested.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have plotted a shock move to sign a Manchester United star as they have ‘asked’ whether a move would be possible.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star is on the brink of leaving the Premier League side as he has ‘said yes’ to a move to a European giant."

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, and they have form for signing veteran goalscorers…",
      "We know these days that players are on the wrong side of the hill once they leave school, but some oldies have shown there’s still life (and goals) in the old dogs once they sign for Manchester United later in their careers.",
      "Watkins is 29 and he would certainly be an upgrade on what the Red Devils currently have up front. Even though he is pushing 30, that didn’t stop these permanent striker signings from making a big impact at Old Trafford…",
      "",
      "Edinson Cavani\nFew United fans cared that Cavani was 33 when he joined United amid the madness of Covid times. For free, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer signed PSG’s then record goalscorer with a tally of 200 in 301 games. It was a much-needed boost a few days after being humped 6-1 at Old Trafford by Tottenham.",
      "Cavani took on the No.7 shirt and made a better fist of living up to its iconic billing than anyone else since the first coming of Ronaldo. Helping United to a runners-up finish in the Premier League – an achievement only recognised in hindsight – the Uruguayan scored 10 league goals and 17 in all competitions, despite having to come off the bench almost as often as he started.",
      "Signing a new one-year contract, Cavani could be forgiven for thinking he had done enough to be trusted to lead United’s line. But then, the second coming. Not only did Ronaldo take the starting spot Cavani wanted; he took the shirt of his back too.",
      "Now 34, Cavani seemed to take it all rather personally. For Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick, his appearances were sporadic and his goals even more so. He was hardly alone in going through the motions for Rangnick, but the desire to get out of Old Trafford was more thinly disguised than most.",
      "",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo\nYes, it all came to a rather unsavoury end, but Ronaldo’s return didn’t seem such a bad idea when he finished the 2021/22 season as the club’s top scorer with 24 goals in 38 appearances, including some big moments in a generally wretched campaign.",
      "Granted, it wasn’t hard to shine in a team that got Solskjaer sacked and barely bothered to tune in to Rangnick, the interim replacement. He didn’t do much in the way of pressing, but what did anyone expect? Especially while he was surrounded by younger pretend pressers, who made Rangnick rip up his philosophy after approximately 45 minutes of his first match in charge.",
      "Top scorer and Player of the Season in his first year back at Old Trafford, Erik ten Hag’s appointment got Ronaldo’s back up. He was picked to start just once in the new manager’s first eight Premier League games, a role never compatible with Ronaldo’s ego.",
      "Rather than keep things in-house to preserve his legacy, Ronaldo took a scorched earth approach to manufacturing an exit. He sat down with Piers Morgan to criticise, well, everything. He wasn’t wrong about many things, but the inevitable mutual consent was reached to allow Ronaldo to move into semi-retirement in Saudi.",
      "",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic\nIbra may have been 34 when he strutted into Old Trafford for a reunion with Jose Mourinho, but there were few signs of the veteran slowing down. He joined United on the back of his most prolific season ever in which he bagged 50 goals in 51 appearances for PSG.",
      "Zlatan was… Zlatan. He was United’s top scorer with 27 goals, netting at crucial times during Jose’s Aldi Treble. He would have scored more had his season not been brought to a premature end by a serious knee injury with a month still to go.",
      "The injury delayed the signing of another one-year contract, but by the time Ibrahimovic was fit, United had signed Romelu Lukaku, who took his starting place and his No.9 shirt. Hardly suited to a stand-in role, Zlatan was allowed to leave Old Trafford in March to join LA Galaxy. But his first season in red is one of pitifully few fond memories for United fans in recent years.",
      "",
      "Robin van Persie\nThere’s a theme among these veteran strikers: brilliant in their first season; far less so after that.",
      "None of the above, though, were as inspiring as Van Persie in his maiden campaign at Old Trafford. He did have the advantage of playing for Sir Alex Ferguson, but even accounting for that, the Netherlands striker’s impact was almost Cantona-esque.",
      "In the wake of losing the title to Manchester City, signing Van Persie from Arsenal was a statement in itself, with City also interested in the Gunners skipper once he identified Arsene Wenger’s side were going nowhere fast. ‘The little boy inside was screaming for United’, as Van Persie put it, so Fergie made sure he got there ahead of his noisy neighbours.",
      "It was decisive in United wrestling back control of Manchester and the Premier League, albeit briefly. Van Persie, evidently born to play at Old Trafford, scored 26 league goals to claim the Golden Boot as well as his first title.",
      "Then, to Van Persie’s horror as much as anyone else’s, Ferguson retired. He still hit double figures for David Moyes and Louis van Gaal in the following two seasons, but the onset of the post-Fergie funk was as a swift as it is stubborn to shift. “Moyes was not to blame – anyone who came in after Ferguson, good luck to you,” said Van Persie after he retired. “It was not only him to blame, it was us as well. The standards were so high but they dropped.”",
      "",
      "Teddy Sheringham\nBucking the trend somewhat, Sheringham struggled badly in his first season at Old Trafford. But it all worked out rather well in the end…",
      "Sheringham signed up for the impossible job: replacing Eric Cantona. At 31, the England striker was a year older than the retiring United skipper who left impossibly big boots to fill.",
      "It probably didn’t help that he barely spoke to his new strike partner Andy Cole. He failed to hit double figures in the league, which was relinquished to Arsenal. So when Ferguson signed Cole’s best mate at the start of the following season, the writing looked to be on the wall.",
      "Sheringham played in fewer than half of the Premier League games as United regained their title, scoring only twice, but the veteran scored career-defining goals off the bench in the FA Cup final and Champions League final to make himself a hero of the Treble.",
      "Even his third season at Old Trafford was a personal struggle – he scored six goals in all competitions. It was only at the fourth attempt, aged 35, that he bagged double figures in the league (15) while breaking the 20-goal barrier in all competitions for the first time, winning the PFA Player of the Year along the way.",
      "Man Utd are responsible for four of the most expensive signings ever of players between the ages of 13 and 36; they later released two of them.",
      "Man Utd have reportedly made a new enquiry for Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins after private talks over a potential swap deal for Marcus Rashford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is “happy to stay to stay at Brentford” according to the Bees’ director of football as Man Utd ‘make contact’ with Aston Villa over their £60m forward.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal are in a ‘new bid’ for a ‘key’ striker target and this move is dependent on the ‘only’ remaining ‘issue’ to overcome.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has decided who he ‘wants’ to manage Al-Nassr and they have ‘said yes’ to the move.",

      "Last time I checked, the sum total of our spend so far has been to pay the release clause to buy Cunha – a move that seems widely accepted to be one that strengthens the team and squad. We’ve also released Eriksen and Lindelof, hard to question those decisions.",
      "Now the Mbeumo pursuit seems to be coming to a head, and he’ll cost about £8-10m more than United’s opening bid for him. Seems standard considering United tax is at play. He’s 25, so you can expect a minimum of 7 years at his current (very good) level or thereabouts. Fits the manager’s system, seems to genuinely WANT to join the club. Tick, tick, tick.",
      "What part of this is horrible business exactly? If Liverpool or Newcastle were signing him for £5 million or so less, would fans be graduating their reaction to suggest they were only getting their pants pulled down to 90% of the level United are? Would they f***. He’d be lauded as a smart addition, and very few would bat an eyelid at the price.",
      "The Kerkez transfer is a good example of the opposite at play – one decent season at a smaller club, cost a decent fee for a full-back, but assumed to be a coup because Liverpool have a recent history of good transfer business. Zero minutes on the pitch so far, but that doesn’t matter. That’s the sort of unquestioning acceptance that Liverpool’s transfer crew have earned over a series of windows, even with Nunez thrown in there as a giant blemish.",

      "So what to do as a United fan for the next 6-7 weeks? Just tune it all out and wait for actual football to return. Try to ignore the usual bollox as we get linked with every player under the sun by witless hacks with no sources. Accept that some players we wish had been shipped out will still be around, but know that each bad apple we do manage to toss overboard helps to stabilise the ship.",
      "And in my own case, distance myself from fellow United fans who now continually proclaim everything to be sh*t in the vain hope that rival fans won’t slag them off when things do go wrong.

      "He correctly identifies the Premier League premium (without explicitly calling it that) but doesn’t mention the two most important factors, which are both linked.",
      "The main one of these is that it is the selling club, not the buying club, who hold the balance of power in this equation. Brentford do not necessarily need to sell one of their best players at all, never mind to a club he could help finish above them, so they can push the price higher.",
      "The other factor is that if Brentford decide to sell Mbeumo, he will need to be replaced and that replacement will not be cheap.",
      "For starters, any potential replacement will be their club’s best player (or very close to), and so they will need to pay a lot to persuade that club to sell, a situation actually exacerbated by the sort of fee they will have extracted from a club the size of Manchester United.",
      "In other words, if I were at Manchester United and had my heart set on signing Mbeumo, I’d be using whatever back channels I could to establish who Brentford’s likely target would be to replace him, and start greasing the wheels there, because it would make buying Mbeumo cheaper and easier.\nEd Quoththeraven",

      "City aren’t back, they’re a work in progress and likely will be for a year or so, maybe longer given they went to play in the CWC. But I don’t even think this is that poor of a reflection on City anyway because with the exception of Pep’s Barca who I think won it at first attempt almost everyone fails this tournament first time round.",
      "Liverpool, United, Real Madrid have all failed at first attempt and won it the second time round. Despite what people think about the quality of the teams it’s not actually easy to win at all. These aren’t pushover teams who can be bullied by Premier League football or even silky Spanish football. I’ve seen these teams get very physical and fast and just the other day we saw Madrid get made to look like training cones by an impressive Al-Ahli passing game.",

      "I am talking about the season, and the Premier League one in particular. Are we in the current one (as in, there isn’t technically one right now), the last one, or the next one? The day after the season ends, are we still in that one, especially if there are still matches to be played by PL teams in other competitions, or is it straight away into “last season” because that ended yesterday?",
      "Does the new season begin with the day after, the release of the fixture list (that inevitably changes), the Shield match, the opening day of the season, or that the transfer window is now open? Are we now in a state of purgatory because there is no season?",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
