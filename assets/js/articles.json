      "Manchester United will have to wait until transfer deadline day if they want to land midfield target Hicham Boudaoui. The Algerian international is the latest name to emerge as a potential solution to Ruben Amorim's midfield issues ahead of the new season.",
      "United boss Amorim has acted quickly to strengthen his front-line, with Matheus Cunha completing a £62.5million move from Wolves. Midfield remains a problem area, though, after a 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro's tough time in English football continued last term, while Amorim seems determined to use Kobbie Mainoo in a more advanced role and hasn't appeared eager to play Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte as a two. Alternatives are being eyed, and 25-year-old Boudaoui is among those to catch the eye.",
      "According to The Sun, United sent scouts to watch the midfielder in action for Algeria against Sweden. It was a game to forget for Boudaoui despite some positive flashes, though, with the visitors 4-0 down when he went off on the hour mark before pulling back three late goals.",
      "Boudaoui has two years left on his current deal with Nice, but has been tipped to leave this summer. Due to United's ownership situation, though, a move may have to wait.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is understood to be waiting until September before making any signings from Nice, who are also owned by Ineos. United and Nice were both involved in last season's Europa League, with a United move for Jean-Clair Todibo made impossible by the situation.",
      "“They’ve said we can sell him to another Premiership club, but we can't sell to Manchester United. But that's not fair on the player and I don’t see what that achieves,\" Ratcliffe told Bloomberg. Todibo eventually completed a season-long loan move to West Ham and has now joined the London side permanently.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the other European clubs reported to be keen on the midfielder decide to test the water before September. The Sun suggests a bid of around £20m could be enough to get a deal over the line.",
      "Nice finished last season in fourth place in Ligue 1, narrowly missing out on automatic qualification for the Champions League's league phase. They still have a chance to make it into the competition through the qualifying rounds, where they will need to come through two two-legged matches.",
      "United, in contrast, won't be in European competition of any kind next season. Their lowly Premier League finish meant the Europa League final offered their only hope, and they lost that against Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "After their worst-ever Premier League finish, the notion of Manchester United being crowned champions any time soon is as fanciful as it is laughable. United finished last season in 15th place, but chief executive Omar Berrada has doubled down on his belief they will lift the Premier League trophy by 2028 – if not before.",
      "Berrada launched Project 150, the bold aim of which is for United to win a 21st league title by 2028, the year the club celebrates its 150th anniversary.",
      "But after the shambles of last season, when United suffered 18 league defeats, failed to get beyond the quarter-finals of both domestic cups and lost the Europa League final to ensure no European football next term, the situation is as bleak as it has ever been in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "Despite that, Berrada is confident with boss Ruben Amorim in charge, the right player recruitment and stability off the field in terms of the club's finances, United can reach the top again within three years.",
      "Asked if winning the title in that timeframe was realistic, Berrada told",
      "\"Of course. We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?",
      "\"I firmly believe that we can do it. We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy — and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",
      "Berrada added: \"Project 150 is a very simple idea. We're going to celebrate our 150th anniversary in June 2028, an important milestone in the history of the club. It's a way of setting a time-bound period where we're going to focus our efforts to achieve certain goals.",
      "\"All we're saying is we're setting ourselves a target with a specific timeframe to go and aim for because if you just said 'we want to win the Premier League' - great, but by when? So this way, again it's from the ownership to management, to everybody in the club, we have a target, we have a mission and that's what we want to achieve.\"",
      "Berrada admitted appointing Amorim a third of the way through last season was always likely to bring difficulties, given his insistence on playing a 3-4-3 formation unfamiliar to the players he inherited from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But Berrada said United were willing to accept short-term pain for long-term gain, in the knowledge 40-year-old Portuguese coach Amorim is the right man to lead the club back to its former glory days.",
      "\"We knew that by bringing in Ruben mid-season that it was going to be even more difficult for the team to perform,\" Berrada added.",
      "\"We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give time to Ruben to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League. So by the time that we got to now, we’d have had all the discussions about what the squad needs and the two-to-three-year plan to get to a squad that’s capable of winning the Premier League.",
      "\"We have a very clear roadmap of how we’re going to get there. Had Ruben started on July 1, 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel these seven or eight months that he’s had. He’s suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered. That’s why I feel that it’s really going to help us in the future.",
      "'I firmly believe in Ruben as a coach and what he’s trying to do. We’ve taken all the short-term pain this season but, as of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us.",
      "\"I’m actually very optimistic and quite positive about what’s ahead. Of course we need to get a lot of decisions right and we will make mistakes, there’s no doubt. We’ll try to minimise those. But what we want is to build something that’s sustainable for the long, long term.",
      "\"We’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting. I’m confident we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into.\"",

      "Sadio Mane once said “never say never” to the idea of joining Newcastle. The Liverpool legend, now playing for Al-Nassr, also admitted previously that he agreed a contract with Manchester United but opted for their Merseyside rivals instead.",
      "Mane, now 33, became a legend at Anfield following his £34million move from Southampton in 2016, scoring 120 goals and providing 46 assists during his six-year stint.",
      "He played a crucial role in Jurgen Klopp's successful rebuild, helping the Reds win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup.",
      "His departure to Bayern Munich for an initial £27m in 2022 was undoubtedly a loss for the English top flight. But the door opened for his return less than 12 months later.",
      "The Senegalese icon’s time in Germany was marred by an injury before the Qatar 2022 World Cup and a reported dressing room fight with team-mate Leroy Sane. It was therefore unsurprising that he was shown the exit door at the end of the season.",
      "It was during that uncertain period that he met Martin Callanan, a Conservative life peer in the House of Lords who is originally from Newcastle. Callahan was attending an EITI International conference in Mane's native Senegal.",
      "He encouraged Mane to join the Magpies, saying in a later tweet: “I’m in Senegal speaking at ⁦the EITI⁩ conference. Honoured to meet ⁦Sadio Mane in the hotel. I couldn’t resist asking him about coming to Newcastle next season. His enigmatic reply: ‘Never say never!’\"",
      "It's unclear whether Mane was merely being courteous or if Newcastle were serious contenders to secure his signature, but he didn't end up at St James Park. Instead, he joined Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr, where he's contributed to 62 goals in 93 matches.",
      "While many who have made similar moves to the Middle East have been accused of chasing money, that record suggests Mane's far from just going through the motions. And his response to Callahan implies a Premier League return may not be completely off the cards, unlike most who are spending the twilight years of their career on Saudi shores.",
      "However, considering his age and the fact that there's still a year left on his contract, the likelihood of a move to Tyneside can probably be categorised in the \"never\" bracket now. While he might still view the switch as desirable, it's hard to imagine the feeling being mutual - though he is being rumoured with an exit from Al-Nassr this summer.",
      "Mane is no stranger to a sudden change in transfer plans. Before joining Liverpool, he was all set to head to Old Trafford until a phone call from Klopp turned his head.",
      "Mane recalled in an interview with the Telegraph: \"I was really close to going to Manchester United. I had the contract there. I had it all agreed. It was all ready, but instead, I thought, 'No, I want to go to Liverpool.'",
      "\"I was convinced to go with Klopp's project. I still remember the first time I got the call from Klopp. He said, 'We have a big project at Liverpool and I want you to be part of it.'\"",

      "The Red Devils reportedly considered him a potential replacement for their current No. 1, Andre Onana.

      "Jack Grealish looks set to be on his way out of Manchester City - and Pep Guardiola is reportedly preparing to offer him up in a straight swap for Real Madrid ace Rodrygo. The out-of-favour winger has spent most of the 2024/25 season on the Etihad Stadium bench, making just seven appearances in City's starting XI during the Premier League campaign.",
      "In 20 total appearances in the league, Grealish scored once and assisted one altogether. The lack of form meant that the England international has been left out of City's Club World Cup squad and will not feature in their opening game against Wydad AC on Wednesday at 5pm.",
      "Guardiola is keen to limit the losses on the £100million man, with City reportedly interested in Real's Rodrygo in a potential swap deal. Defensa Central reports that the Spanish manager has asked the club to utilise Grealish with the 'idea of lowering the price for the Brazilian' winger this summer.",
      "However, these plans may be squashed before they begin, as UOL reports that new Real boss Xabi Alonso is 'counting on the young Brazilian and, therefore, is against a transfer this summer'.",
      "Guardiola has got other options for Grealish, as we reported that Serie A champions Napoli are in the running for the winger's signature.",
      "Grealish is subject of interest from the Italian side, but his hefty £300,000-per-week wages may create a barrier in the deal transpiring. As well as this, other reports suggest that Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho is on their radar.",
      "Garnacho may cause an issue with Grealish's potential move to Italy this summer, as Napoli may opt for a younger star out wide in the 20-year-old, rather the man nine years his senior.",
      "Napoli have already been shopping in the Manchester this summer, snapping up long-time City servant Kevin De Bruyne on a two-year deal following his emotional exit from the club.",
      "There are more clubs reportedly interested in bringing Grealish on a loan move. Newcastle, Everton and Tottenham may all be prepared to give the winger a chance next season.",
      "A sensational return to his boyhood club Aston Villa could may well be an option for Grealish, and he wouldn't be the first big-money player to enjoy a homecoming in the Premier League.",
      "Spurs icon Gareth Bale was given a final season at his old club in the 2020/21 season, scoring 16 goals in all competitions - and these statistics could be a welcoming sight for Grealish if he does plan on moving permanently from the Etihad Stadium in the future.",
      "Speaking ahead of the Club World Cup, Guardiola admitted that Grealish does require more game time, but this doesn't mean it will be with his current club in the near future. The City boss said: \"Of course, Jack has to play. He’s an unbelievable player that has to play football every three days. It didn’t happen this season and last season either. He needs to do it, with us or another place.",
      "\"It’s a question for Jack, his agent and the club. If he stays it will be fine and he will fight like he fought from day one to make a contribution, but not today.\"",

      "Speculation over the winger's future has ramped up as he is understood to have fallen out with United head coach Ruben Amorim at the end of this season. A £40million offer was made for the Argentine by Napoli in January, but swiftly dismissed by the Premier League giants.",
      "However, it's believed a sum of about £70m would seal his departure. As Garnacho nears the Old Trafford exit door, former Liverpool striker Dean Saunders has claimed a row over tactics was to blame for his bust-up with Amorim.",

      "Amorim has already begun reshaping his United squad this summer following the arrival of Matheus Cunha for £62.5m. Bryan Mbeumo is also anticipated to join from Brentford despite Thomas Frank's reported interest in taking the winger with him to Tottenham.",

      "Angry Ginge continued his running feud with Carlos Tevez by labelling the football legend a \"f***ing traitor\" after their Soccer Aid clash. Popular streamer Angry Ginge, real name Morgan Burtwistle, lived out his childhood dream of playing on the Old Trafford turf during Sunday's charity game.",
      "The lifelong United fan played in defence for England during Soccer Aid 2025, which meant he faced former Red Devils striker Tevez, who represented the World XI.",
      "Tevez won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with United but infamously joined rivals Manchester City in 2009. He instantly became a loathed figure at the Theatre of Dreams and severed all ties by celebrating against his former club during a Manchester Derby.",
      "That was evidently still fresh in Burtwistle's mind as the YouTuber saw his chance to get revenge during Sunday's friendly game, flying in with a crunching challenge on the Argentine.",
      "He got the ball but Tevez was left unhappy with the aggressive nature of the challenge and made sure to leave something on Ginge, slightly kicking out at the defender.",
      "Tevez quickly realised where he was and decided to then shake hands with the 23-year-old. For Ginge, however, the bad blood remained beyond the final whistle as he took to Instagram to post a photo of a nasty gash on his leg courtesy of Tevez.",
      "His caption read: \"Cheers Tevez, t***,\" echoing his thoughts on the Boca Juniors icon, having once admitted that he \"can't stand\" him. And he wasn't done there, later revealing on one of his live streams that he had his match-worn Soccer Aid shirt signed by everyone on both teams, except Tevez, who he slammed.",
      "The internet personality said: \"Look at that. Signed by every single person on the team. And the away team. Bar one man. The f***ing traitor. Tevez ain't signing my f***ing shirt. Not in a million years. No chance.\"",
      "Tevez had the last laugh, however, scoring four goals in just 15 minutes to lead the World XI's comeback. He was booed after each goal by the crowd but appeared to revel in his role as the pantomime villain, cupping his ear and pointing to the name on the back of his shirt.",
      "He managed to level the game, which paved the way for musician Big Zuu to score the late winner and secure a memorable 5-4 victory. Zuu emphatically celebrated with his own version of Cristiano Ronaldo's Siu celebration.",
      "Ginge, meanwhile, had the consolation of being awarded Player of the Match over Tevez. His tireless defensive work included diving across the goal to stop France World Cup winner David Trezeguet from scoring the equaliser.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window has seen them face rejection on more than one occasion already. However, the Red Devils have suffered plenty of rebuffs before – even in their heyday – as evident during the Ruud van Nistelrooy transfer saga of 2000.",
      "It is now suggested that the Danish head coach wishes to bring Mbeumo to north London with him, and with a superior £70million offer tabled, doubts loom over whether he'll prefer to stay in the capital or jump ship for Old Trafford.",
      "One of Amorim's former players, Sporting CP ace Viktor Gyokeres, was also targeted this window as the club looks to add potency to their strikeforce, but reports from Portugal suggest he has turned his nose up at a reunion in Manchester.",
      "Such dismissal harkens memories of 25 years ago, when PSV's star striker Van Nistelrooy looked certain to complete a move to Sir Alex Ferguson's United, only for medical tests to throw a decisive spanner in the works. However, in this instance, the Red Devils got the last laugh.",
      "Van Nistelrooy made light work of the Eredivisie during his stint with PSV from 1998 to 2000. He scored 77 goals in 90 league games, won the Dutch Player of the Year award in all three terms, and was twice the league's top scorer.",
      "It was only a matter of time before top European sides came sniffing, and Ferguson's United did just that, with the Scottish boss being tipped off about the striker by his son and agreeing to a deal one day after sending scouts to the Netherlands.",
      "A fee of £18.5m was shaken hands upon, a prospective British record sum, however niggling concerns about the then-sidelined Dutchman's knee led to the request of additional tests during Van Nistelrooy's medical.",
      "United wished to keep the striker in Manchester for extra tests, but the player and his club refused, citing that the tests could potentially delay his recovery, and the deal was called off.",
      "\"Manchester United is very disappointed that the transfer of Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV Eindhoven cannot proceed at this present time,\" read a statement from the club. \"As reported on Tuesday, April 25, 2000, further tests were necessary for Manchester United to proceed with the transfer.",
      "\"The discussions that have been held between all the parties failed to reach agreement as to the extent of these tests, and as a result of this difference in opinion, we cannot proceed at this present time.\"",
      "Alas, Ferguson and his team breathed an immediate sigh of relief when, just a week after the deal folded, Van Nistelrooy suffered a serious knee injury in training that kept him out of action for the year.",
      "Fast forward to 12 months later, Van Nistelrooy put pen to paper on a British record £19m deal, and he touched down in Manchester to lead the Red Devils' line. He would play over 200 games for United, scoring a staggering 150 goals while winning a league title and FA Cup crown.",

      "The 20-year-old has been told he's free to find a new club, with Ruben Amorim deeming him surplus to requirement after their falling out. While Napoli's £40million January offer was briskly dismissed, it's believed a sum of about £60-70m would be enough to see him leave.",
      "There's been no indication so far in the early going of the window that anyone will be willing to push that high. Nonetheless, it seems that Konrad Borzyskowski, the man behind the lens for Garnacho, can't foresee a future where the Argentinian talent is playing for the Red Devils again next season.",
      "He took to Instagram on Monday to share a collection of photos he'd taken of Garnacho throughout the 2024/25 campaign. It was captioned: \"One last time in @manchesterunited red... @garnacho7 under the microscope.\"",

      "Amorim had enjoyed success in his homeland, playing a specific 3-4-3 system, that helped Sporting win numerous honours. The manager himself expressed concerns about making the hop during the campaign due to the time needed to embed his philosophy.",
      "United made it clear it was now or never following a request to join in the summer and Amorim eventually took charge of his first game in November. The team struggled for results and posted their worst campaign since the 1970s but Berrada believes the short-term pain will work out for the best.",
      "He told United We Stand: \"We knew that by bringing in Ruben mid-season that it was going to be even more difficult for the team to perform. We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give Ruben time to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League. We have a very clear roadmap.",
      "\"Had Ruben started on 1 July 2025, we wouldn't have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that's what I feel about these seven or eight months that he's had in the Premier League and what he's suffered in the Premier League and the team has suffered. It's really going to help us in the future.",
      "Berrada ultimately confessed: \"I think we probably underestimated the time it would have required the team to adjust to the system. But we don't regret the decision because I'm convinced that we'll see this pay off next season.\"",
      "Amorim himself had warned the Manchester bosses of the risk they were taking in asking him to join midway through a season, but ultimately couldn't say no to the opportunity. That was before he would win just seven of his 27 Premier League games and lost the Europa League final.",
      "The 40-year-old said: \"When you start a season, it's completely different. You feel things, have a pre-season and time to change things you feel are necessary in a team and a squad. That is clear. That was the choice so I don't want to talk about that. I had my reasons to ask for it. I knew it would be tough and a risk, but it's Manchester United and you can't say no.\"",

      "\"We have a very clear roadmap of how we’re going to get there. Had Ruben started on July 1, 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel these seven or eight months that he’s had. He’s suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered. That’s why I feel that it’s really going to help us in the future.\"",
      "Berrada, who worked at Manchester City before crossing the city to join United, said there were similarities between Amorim's start at United and Pep Guardiola's first season at City.",
      "“Very much so,” Berrada told United We Stand. “Pep stuck to his principles and given what he’d won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank. He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.",
      "\"We’ve taken all the short-term pain in this season, but as of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us. We will have settled the management team; we will have settled the coaching team with the technical team around them.",
      "\"On the football side, there’s a clear idea of what we want to do, what players we want to get, how we want to see the team playing, how we’re going to integrate academy players, how we’re going to go and invest in future talent.",
      "\"I’m actually very optimistic and quite positive about what’s ahead. Of course we need to get a lot of decisions right. And we will make mistakes, there’s no doubt. We’ll try to minimise those. But what we want is to build something that’s sustainable for the long, long term.",
      "\"We’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting. I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into.\"",

      "Dwight Yorke has laid into former club Manchester United and claimed they are “way off” competing with the top teams in the Premier League.",
      "United ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish of the Premier League era, and failed to secure European football for next term after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Against that backdrop, Yorke – who won the Treble with United in 1999 – said there is no way Ruben Amorim's side can challenge the top clubs in England, like Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "\"I don't think so,” Yorke told Flash Score. “They are probably not in the conversation right now. Let's get back to trying to compete at a very consistent, sort of consistent, what we do consistently.",
      "\"And if we can do that, then we'll have to see where we finish. But in terms of challenging the big boys in the minute, we're way off the mark.",
      "\"I think it's been well documented that it's been a really poor season by our standards. Of course we don't like to see Manchester United in the position that they are, but it's where the club is at the moment.",
      "\"It's been a very difficult campaign all round, so we have to look at the season and have a reflection and hopefully come back stronger and with a bit of fighting spirit. If we're finishing 15th in the league, then something is really wrong. So we have to reflect and start building immediately.\"",
      "Asked how much time Amorim should be given to turn United's fortunes around, Yorke said: \"I don't know the exact amount of time. What I do know as a manager, is you've got to win football matches. And the more you go about not winning football matches, you're certainly making life difficult for yourself.",
      "\"So I think as any manager, he has got to find a way to try to win matches and be a little bit more consistent. But if you're not winning matches, you're sort of forcing the way in terms of trying to put a real negative spin on it.”",
      "Asked what he would do differently if he were in Amorim's position, Yorke said: \"Well, to begin with, I would need some players. If I don't get the players, then it's a bit difficult to sort of even implement those ideas. I think that there's enough in the team.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of talent within the squad. You've just got to find a way to win matches.\"",

      "Despite the leak being, well, let's be honest, wrong, the start and finish dates are correct, as provided by the Premier League. The weekend of Saturday August 16 will kick-off the season before it ends on Sunday 24 May 2026. The season will consist of 33 weekends and five midweek match rounds.",
      "Players have been afforded 83 clear days of rest from the end of the 2024/25 season - not accounting of course for those involved in the Club World Cup. Welfare also looks to have been paramount during the notorious festive period. No two rounds take place within 60 hours of each other, which honours commitments made to clubs to address the congested Christmas and New Year schedule.",

    "body": [
      "Bryan Mbeumo looks to be on the move from Brentford this summer, but the burning question is will he arrive at Old Trafford or the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 25-year-old winger scored 20 goals and bagged eight assists for the Bees this season, and as a result, a number of their Premier League rivals are linked with him.",
      "Manchester United have been pursuing Mbeumo since the initial summer transfer window opened, with Ruben Amorim looking to bolster his firepower for 2025/26 following a dismal 15th-place finish. The Red Devils saw an initial bid worth up to £55million rejected by Brentford, who value Mbeumo at £60m.",
      "However, it is said that United are currently preparing another offer for the Cameroon international, who has 22 caps for the country. Thomas Frank moving to north London put the cat amongst the pigeons.",
      "The Danish mastermind, who enjoyed seven years at Brentford, was appointed as Spurs' new manager earlier this month in the wake of Ange Postecoglou's sacking, and he will also be hoping to enhance his attacking options as the Lilywhites finished even lower than United in 17th, albeit beating them in the Europa League final.",
      "It's claimed United remain confident in their pursuit of Mbeumo despite interest from Spurs. According to the MEN, the forward has told confidants that Old Trafford is his destination of choice, although other sources have claimed that he has not snubbed the possibility of reuniting with Frank at Spurs.",
      "Sources say Spurs are \"going hard\" for the talisman and are potentially ready to offer a higher salary, but United are still the frontrunners in the race to secure his signature. After already shelling out £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, it's clear Amorim has the backing of the board this summer as he looks to overhaul his inherited squad from Erik ten Hag.",
      "And it is thought that Mbeumo would be perfect for Amorim's patented 3-4-2-1 system as United hope to find an answer for their right-hand flank, given that it has been a problem position at Old Trafford for more than a decade now.",
      "Elsewhere, Mbeumo has noted that he \"accepts\" the speculation surrounding his future. Spurs are said to have held initial talks with Brentford over a deal for the attacker, who finds himself more intrigued by the team now that they have playing under Frank as an added incentive.",
      "He added: \"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League. And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "Despite sources claiming that Mbeumo is more favouring of United this summer, the star has kept his cards incredibly close to his chest since Spurs entered the race for his signature.",
      "Spurs have a back-up in mind should they be unable to sign Mbeumo this summer, with talks having been held with the representatives of Antoine Semenyo of Bournemouth. The winger enjoyed somewhat of a breakthrough season with the Cherries in 2024/25, scoring 11 goals and providing six assists in the Premier League.",
      "Spurs like his versatility, able to play wide or as a No.9. But Bournemouth have no intention of parting with the Ghanaian, 25, cheaply - refusing to go for anything less than £60m, however, reflecting his importance as a key player.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "After spending £81.3million on Antony in September 2022 and an initial £64m on Rasmus Hojlund 11 months later, Manchester United know what it's like to get stung in the transfer market.",
      "United spent the entirety of the 2022 summer transfer window chasing Antony's tail, confident that a reunion with Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford would fix their long-term right-wing problems.",
      "Having never once stepped foot in one of Europe's top five leagues, the fee United paid Ajax to bring Antony to England was nothing short of astronomical. United had been reluctant to meet Ajax's demands for much of the summer.",
      "Less than three years later, United have made Antony one of three players they want to sell as a priority this summer. They need to bank £32.5m for him to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability [PSR] regulations.",
      "Antony will go down as one of the Premier League's greatest flops. Perhaps the greatest. No club wants to be associated with that particular tag.",
      "The addition of Antony, likewise Hojlund the following summer, is a prime example of just how reckless United have been in their spending in recent years. They have had their pants pulled down far too often, sometimes through sheer desperation to get a deal over the line.",
      "Both Ajax and Atalanta must not have been able to believe their luck when United agreed to such big-money deals to sign two raw and unproven attackers. Chelsea, too, must have been rubbing their hands together when they pocketed an initial fee of £55m for Mason Mount with just one year remaining on his contract in July 2023.",
      "Recruitment failings have been a massive contributor to United's decline. Too many deals have been conducted without football specialists or recruitment gurus overseeing them.",
      "However, under Ineos' leadership, United have offered signs of encouragement on the recruitment front. Although last summer's recruitment was not perfect, it was certainly better than what had been served up in previous years.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui arrived for a bargain base fee of just £12.8m and Leny Yoro, who is widely regarded as one of the most promising centre-backs in world football, was drafted in with the ambition of making him a mainstay in United's defence for years to come.",
      "With a sensible recruitment strategy in place, United will believe they are on the right track in their quest to achieve 'Project 150' in 2028 and win both the Premier League and the Women's Super League.",
      "Having laid the foundations and offered an insight into how they plan to recruit under Ineos' stewardship last summer, United are trying to raise the bar again this summer. Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves for £62.5m and United hope Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will be the next arrival.",
      "United want to move at speed this summer to get the squad in as good a position as possible ahead of the start of the 2025/26 season, and the addition of Cunha so early on in the window is a reflection of their ambitions.",
      "Just days after confirming they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Cunha, United saw a £55m offer turned down for Mbeumo. Yes, the offer fell short of Brentford's valuation, but it once again highlighted how keen the club is to get on with rebuilding the squad this summer.",
      "As hungry as United are for new additions, they need to ensure they find the right balance between moving at speed and not paying over the odds and repeating mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" chief executive Omar Berrada recently told United We Stand.",
      "\"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "Every club dreams of getting deals done quickly. It is every coach's dream to have the bulk of his business done in time for the start of pre-season.",
      "That, however, is a dream that rarely becomes a reality. Nevertheless, United are actively working to get new signings through the door.",
      "As commendable as that particular element is, United also deserve recognition for trying to distance themselves from mistakes of the past. They understand and embrace the hunger for signings, but they are not prepared to have their pants pulled down again."

      "The 25-year-old's stock is currently high after scoring 20 Premier League goals for Brentford in the 2024/25 campaign. United view him as the second of three attacking signings they would like to make this summer.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already been added to United's attack, arriving from Wolves last week after his £62.5m release clause was triggered, and they still want to add Mbeumo and an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Spurs' interest in the former Troyes man should come as no surprise amid the fact they appointed Thomas Frank as their new head coach last week after extracting him from the Gtech Community Stadium. Frank worked with Mbeumo for six years in west London.",
      "Despite his former boss being keen on a reunion in north London, Mbeumo has informed confidants that United, just as they were two weeks ago, remain his preferred choice. He has his sights set on playing at Old Trafford and making a name for himself under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United lost to Spurs in last month's Europa League final, of course, meaning the Londoners secured Champions League qualification for next season at their expense. Champions League football is the holy grail for most players, meaning it would be easy to understand why Mbeumo could favour a move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium over Old Trafford.",
      "However, despite United being unable to offer any form of European football in 2025/26, Mbeumo remains keen to move to M16. And it is players of that mindset and mentality United need to recruit this summer.",
      "Furthermore, it has highlighted Amorim was right that any player will always dream of playing for United's because of their history and heritage.",
      "Speaking in April, Amorim said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club.",
      "\"I know that if you look at our club at the moment it looks like sometimes with all the problems with the staff, people going, changing coach, the results, it looks like a little bit of a problem at the moment. But we have a clear idea.",
      "\"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "There is no denying the fact the 2024/25 campaign was a forgettable period in United's history, but one bad season cannot undo all of the pomp and pageantry that comes with arguably the biggest sporting institution in the world.",
      "United will always appeal to players and they have clearly caught Mbeumo's attention. The fact he is so keen on joining United at this current juncture is also a positive reflection of his character and mentality."

Hojlund had to wait a year for Anthony Martial's outstayed welcome to expire before he assumed the number.

      "United bought two centre backs and a right back before a defensive midfielder when the glaring issue in their madcap 2023-24 campaign was the absence of a shield in front of the back four. Erik ten Hag had two No.6s but Casemiro was injury-prone and Sofyan Amrabat not entrusted until the final two weeks of the season. He was not signed permanently.",
      "Two years ago, a starting striker was essential. The belated call on David de Gea's future made a new goalkeeper inevitable and Andre Onana came in less than three weeks after his predecessor brought down the curtain on 12 years at United.",
      "United had been yearning for a goalscorer for a year. At the start of United's 2023 pre-season tour in New Jersey, we stopped Ten Hag in the mixed zone for an impromptu chat. When did he hope the striker would arrive?",
      "\"Last year!\" he chuckled. Cristiano Ronaldo's heart was no longer in it at United in his second season. Martial's body had more breakdowns than a day on the M6 and United had quietly bade farewell to Wout Weghorst, scorer of two tap-ins in 31 games.",
      "Hojlund was the last of the three major incomings, a deal still concluded early enough for him to be introduced to United fans before their pre-season friendly with Lens at Old Trafford. The downside was a stress fracture of his back delayed his debut by four more weeks.",
      "In Ten Hag's first window, a midfield linchpin was sought. United travelled to Thailand and Australia that summer while Frenkie de Jong headed to the United States with Barcelona. A deal for De Jong always seemed as distant.",
      "Two damaging results to Brighton and Brentford later, United were panicked into a £70m deal for Casemiro in late August. Without Casemiro, they might not have qualified for the Champions League that season.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was one of the weakest United managers, which may account for the enviable backing he often enjoyed. Whether you regarded a winger or a centre back as United's priority in 2021, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane were United's first two buys and they had both in the building before the season started.",
      "The 2020 window was unique amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with United restricted to a four-week turnaround between the seasons. They had also been bolstered by the season-changing winter signing of Bruno Fernandes.",
      "With a back five firmly established and United inundated with midfielders, an incisive forward was wanted. Sancho and Jack Grealish were unattainable. Donny van de Beek was on the same shortlist as the latter and, even with the protocols about isolating, was able to debut in United's first fixture.",
      "Solskjaer had to wait a while for Harry Maguire in 2019, a summer infamous for United's one-at-a-time strategy. With the transfer window's closure date brought forward to before the start of the season, United spent roughly a month apiece to bring in Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka before the world-record £80m they spent on Maguire in August.",
      "2018-19 had been United's worst defensive season in 40 years after Ed Woodward failed, or refused, to furnish Jose Mourinho with a new centre back. Maguire, also coveted by Mourinho, was priced at £75m by Leicester in 2018 and left for only £5m more a year later. Mourinho is the only modern United manager to be deprived of a priority target.",
      "Cunha has been rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, two Brazilians who got away from United. The club has a dire hit-rate with Brazilian players but Cunha is the first to join them who has already played in the Premier League.",
      "So has Bryan Mbeumo. Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland are the only players who scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in 2024-25. Mbeumo tallied a superb 20. Cunha got 15.",
      "Nobody would expect, or want, either to lead the line for United. They have needed a proven goalscorer for three years and Liam Delap is not that. Delap is not a miss but missing out on him will prolong United's search for a striker, almost certainly into July. Perhaps even August.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, June 17.",
      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened and clubs can now start doing business freely again until the market closes for good on Monday, September 1. United have plenty of business to do both this week, and the subsequent weeks which are to follow.",
      "United's top priority will be to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford after the Brentford star's ongoing negotiations with the Reds. Tottenham Hotspur have also shown an interest in him following the appointment of Thomas Frank and the Cameroonian has now broken his silence surrounding his future.",
      "Elsewhere, United appeared to receive a boost in their hunt to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer. Reports in Portugal suggest that Arsenal's interest is cooling in the Swedish star due to Sporting's valuation of the forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund continues to be linked with a move back to Italy with Inter Milan seemingly desperate for his signature. All United players are available to be sold in the summer window, for the right price, and thus Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all have suitors chasing their services.",
      "Keep across the United transfer updates in our blog below:",
      "United are one of several clubs said to be interested in Malick Fofana.",
      "L'Equipe claims Chelsea have enquired with Lyon about the winger, while Liverpool are another Premier League team linked. However, the French club reputedly have an asking price of over €50million (£43million), more than they sold Rayan Cherki to Manchester City.",
      "United are reportedly one of as many as ten clubs scouting Richard Rios at the Club World Cup.",
      "GiveMeSport claims Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur are two teams interested in the Palmeiras player. CaughtOffside have previously stated it is their understanding that the midfielder has a €100m release clause, which the Brazilian club want to be paid in full.",
      "Caykur Rizespor reportedly have shown interest in Altay Bayindir after United put the goalkeeper 'on their sale list'.",
      "Fotomac reports that the manager has contacted representatives of Turkey's big four teams - Besiktas, Fenerbahce, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor. However, the feedback received is said to have been negative.",
      "Bayindir, however, would reputedly rather remain in Europe than return to Turkey with a team outside of the top four. United signed the player from Fenerbahce, but he previously played for Ankaragucu.",
      "Pervis Estupinan reputedly wants to leave Brighton & Hove Albion and sign for United this summer.",
      "The club's former chief scout, Mick Brown, has told Football Insider:",
      "His agent has been making his availability known to a number of clubs, and from what I hear, he wants to join Man United. I think he's a decent player, but I don't think it's going to be a priority for them. Luke Shaw has got back to full fitness, and they're hopeful he can stay fit; they bought [Patrick] Dorgu in January, and they've got Harry Amass coming through as well.",
      "Their priorities are at centre-forward and in midfield, so I don't expect them to move for Estupinan. He's a player they wanted previously, and I'm sure he's still got admirers, but unfortunately for him, they look to have moved on.",
      "Ethan Wheatley scored for England this evening to help them come from 5-1 down to draw 5-5 with Germany at the European Under-19 Championship.",
      "The teenage United striker scored soon after Said El Mala made it five early in the second half. Barely ten minutes later, the Young Lions were level, with Reiss-Alexander Russel-Denny, Zach Abbott and Jesse Derry scoring to salvage a point in Bucharest, Romania.",
      "United have reportedly held talks over signing Roony Bardghji.",
      "TBR Football claims the Copenhagen player is due to leave this summer with mere months remaining on his contract that expires on New Year's Eve. Aston Villa, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Marseille, Newcastle United, Porto, RB Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur are also said to have discussed a deal for Bardghji.",
      "United have reportedly held talks with the representatives of Juventus centre-forward Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "FootballTransfers claims the player's camp approached United as their client is reputedly keen to make a dream move to the Premier League this summer transfer window. Their recent discussions are said to have been 'positive and constructive.'",
      "The former Chelsea player Florent Malouda believes ex-United midfielder Paul Pogba belongs in the Premier League, not at Monaco.",
      "I’ve seen the talk of Paul Pogba to Monaco, and I don’t think it’s the right move for him. I think Chelsea needs an experienced player, and Pogba has won the World Cup and the Europa League and knows the Premier League so well.",
      "I think he belongs in the Premier League. Honestly, I think he belongs in the Premier League.",
      "If he manages to get his fitness right, that is the first step. People underrate him because he has been away, but he would bring leadership.",
      "He is hoping to lead France at the World Cup, and I think a team like Chelsea or Arsenal should try and sign him; he is a very gifted player. He has a great mindset, and he has been resilient in his career and in his private life.",
      "He will want to get to the top, and his experience would be so valuable. All he does is overcome challenges, and with Chelsea, I think he could adjust very well to their dressing room.",
      "Florent Malouda was speaking on behalf of bet365 and their launch of the free-to-play Club World Championship Tournament Predictor game.",
      "Al-Hilal chief executive Esteve Calzada has remained coy over whether the Saudi Pro League club tried to sign Bruno Fernandes earlier this month.",
      "The club's CEO told the BBC:",
      "I cannot confirm nor deny that we've been interested in him. He's a big player; it fits the profile of player that we think would be good for Al-Hilal, just like many others.",
      "We're not refraining from contacting players because we feel they would say no to us. The names we are linked with demonstrate the ambition of the club. We believe that we are in a position to pitch [to] any players nowadays.",
      "The former Chelsea player Florent Malouda believes Bryan Mbeumo needs a shift of mentality to fulfil his potential and become a great player.",
      "For Bryan Mbeumo, it's about expectation. It's a great opportunity to play for Manchester United, but at the same time, we know that the context is not favourable.",
      "I would compare it to the situation at Real Madrid. A club with a big history, [United] still reached a European final [in the Europa League], but there are internal issues that you don't want to be involved with – you don't want to have the responsibility of fixing everything.",
      "You want to focus on your individual performance, but that will also depend on the collective and how things are going in terms of the balance of the team. Jadon Sancho is going back, so that is another choice that might impact your performance, but Mbeumo has the potential to be a great player if he can shift his mindset.",
      "He has been playing with not much expectation of winning trophies or competing for the Premier League; he is now about to join a big club with a big history, where it's usual to be high in the table. Mbeumo can do that, but he has to adapt his performances.",
      "Florent Malouda was speaking on behalf of bet365 and their launch of the free-to-play Club World Championship Tournament Predictor game.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly added Gabriel Sara 'to the transfer list' after following and watching the Galatasaray player.",
      "Fotomac, a Turkish online sports newspaper, also credits Inter with an interest in the midfielder. His club are reputedly willing to begin negotiating at around €30million (£26million) a year after paying around half that to Norwich City for the Brazilian.",
      "According to Football Insider, United are now in a position where they are willing to listen to offers for Mason Mount.",
      "It is claimed that there is a possibility now that Mount could be sold despite regaining his fitness for the Reds this season.",
      "MEN Sport has previously reported that United are willing to listen to offers for any of the players this summer.",
      "According to Football Insider, Emiliano Martinez continues to push for an exit from Aston Villa.",
      "The shot stopper bid an emotional farewell to the Villa fans after the last home match of the Premier League season and it is claimed his stance on an exit from Old Trafford has not changed.",
      "Martinez thought to be a player that United are looking at despite Onana looking set to remain in Manchester.",
      "Amid ongoing reports linking United with a move for Emi Martinez this summer, MEN Sport understands that Andre Onana is expected to stay at the club this summer.",
      "It is believed that Onana has been working hard to convince his fellow countryman Bryan Mbeumo to sign for the Reds.",
      "Onana is thought to have held a meeting last week with United officials where he was reassured that he shall remain at the club beyond this summer.",
      "The new Manchester United kit is draped over the mannequins in the Old Trafford Megastore. On the online store, a handful of players' names are pre-printed on the new shirt.",
      "Fernandes, Yoro, Martinez, Amad and Maguire are all featured. Safe choices. Ella Toone, Maya le Tissier and Grace Clinton also have that privilege.",
      "It would be remiss of United to proactively plug 'Hojlund 9'. Get 'Rashford 10' or 'Garnacho 17' at your peril. 'Sancho' and 'Antony 21' are not even listed on the online options.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "The Athletic understands that Real Betis remain keen to bring Antony to their club permanently this summer.",
      "Talks are understood to have taken place with United to find out what their stance is. MEN Sport understands that United are keen to sell the Brazilian winger.",
      "No offers have yet been made for Antony and there is a realisation that this one could take time to complete.",
      "In perhaps the biggest hint yet that Garnacho will be leaving, his personal photographer Konrad Borzy appeared to confirm that the Aregentine had made his last appearances for the club.",
      "Posting on Instagram a selection of photos of the winger in action, Borzy wrote:",
      "One last time in Manchester United red… Garnacho under the lens.",
      "After turning down a move to Al Hilal this summer, Galatasaray remain interested in Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Athletic understands that Osimhen's wage demands are not a problem for the Istanbul club.",
      "However, they would likely struggle to activate the forward's £63m release clause this summer and would need Napoli to soften their position.",
      "Now Football Insider have claimed that United are unlikely to pursue a summer deal for Ekitke.",
      "The 22-year-old is in high demand but the outlet has claimed that sources have told them that the price-tag for the France youngster.",
      "The transfer mystery continues.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United have agreed a new deal for third choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton.",
      "It is understood this news has been shared with Amorim and his coaching staff.",
      "Heaton has reportedly signed a new one-year contract and the news will be confirmed soon.",
      "In an interview with United We Stand, the club's CEO Omar Berrada has spoken about the potential timeline for new additions to this squad this summer.",
      "Explaining the plan, he said:",
      "He [Matheus Cunha] was an important one to get done. We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly. Sometimes when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, the interest in Sancho from Napoli is there but his wages could prevent a deal from happening.",
      "The structure of a deal is currently unknown but this will apparently not stop the Naples club trying for him.",
      "Sancho has just one year remaining on his deal at United.",
      "If we were in Sancho's shoes right now, we would be all over a move to Napoli this summer.",
      "The club is on a high after winning Serie A, shall be playing in the Champions League and has already shown what they can do for a player that has lost their way.",
      "McTominay has progressed leaps and bounds under Conte and Sancho must surely feel he can follow in those footsteps.",
      "Journalist Gianluca di Marzio understands that Napoli have opened up as a potential home for Jadon Sancho this summer.",
      "United are on the lookout for suitors for Sancho after he failed to reach personal terms with Chelsea at the end of the season.",
      "Napoli reinvigorated the career of Scott McTominay this season and are looking to strengthen their wings ahead of the new campaign.",
      "With Boudaoui currently playing for Nice, another arm of Ineos' sporting empire, there may be some concerns as to whether United can actually purchase the midfielder.",
      "Last year, it was thought that United were blocked from signing Jean-Clair Todibo because both Nice and the Reds were competing in the Europa League.",
      "However, because United are not competing in Europe next season, it is unlikely that UEFA would block the sale as it would not be seen as a conflict of interest.",
      "Manchester United reportedly sent scouts to watch OGC Nice midfielder Hicham Boudaoui during Algeria's encounter with Sweden.",
      "It has been said that the transfer chiefs at Old Trafford monitored the 25-year-old's performance with reports suggesting that the club are eyeing a midfield addition this summer.",
      "In a report last month, it was claimed that an exit was looking increasingly likely for the Nice man.",
      "According to The Athletic, Eintracht Frankfurt remain stubborn with their £85m price tag for their talisman this summer.",
      "However, United have contacted the German club regarding his availability and how much the deal would cost.",
      "It is believed that these enquiries have found that Frankfurt are flexible on the structure of the £85m deal which could open the door for Ekitike to arrive in Manchester.",
      "Remaining on Hugo Ekitike, according to Caught Offside, United are still keen on his signature.",
      "It has been said that the fee for the Eintracht Frankfurt star is problematic but they are trying to bring the €100m (£85m) fee down.",
      "A swap deal isn't being ruled out either, the report adds. United could offer Ramus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee as part of the deal.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported that Manchester United face a fight to sign Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Liverpool are also reportedly interested.",
      "However, the Anfield club face a number of factors surrounding their pursuit namely the future of Darwin Nunez.",
      "Romano claimed: “With Darwin leaving, Ekitike is a concrete target for Liverpool. Liverpool already spoke to the agents of the player at the end of May.",
      "\"Liverpool are in regular contact with people close to Hugo Ekitike, so for sure Ekitike remains a player on Liverpool’s list.",
      "“I know there are rumours on several clubs for this kind of striker, but don’t forget Liverpool, because they are still there.”",
      "Hello, we are back for another day of news and all things transfers.",
      "The window reopened yesterday and Manchester United will be pushing to ensure that they can acquire their targets as the market heats up."

      "Now plans will be well underway for further new additions to be made to Ruben Amorim's squad over the next couple of months.",
      "The summer transfer window runs until September 1, which gives United plenty of time to get deals over the line. Fofana has become the latest name mentioned on the United transfer rumour mill as a potential target.",
      "French news outlet L'Equipe have reported that United have entered the race to sign Fofana this summer and have expressed an interest in bringing the 20-year-old to Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea have been mentioned in the report as making an approach to Lyon about the possibility of signing Fofana, although no offer has been made for the Belgium international.",
      "Liverpool are also mentioned in the report alongside United as showing an interest in Fofana. It is claimed the Premier League champions have opened talks with the player's representatives.",
      "Lyon are reported to value Fofana at a fee greater than €50million (£42.7million). It has been speculated that there is a chance the forward will not be in attendance for Lyon's first day of pre-season training on July 7, due to reported interest from English clubs.",
      "Fofana enjoyed an impressive season for Lyon last term, scoring 11 goals in all competitions.",
      "The forward missed the first leg of the Europa League quarter-final against United with injury, but featured in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford and provided an assist as United ran out 5-4 winners on the night."

      "The Brazilian international finalised his move to M16 last week after United triggered his £62.5million release clause earlier this month. He has joined from Wolves on a five-year deal.",
      "Cunha is expected to add goals and creativity to United's attack after plundering an impressive 17 goals for Wolves in 2024/25.",
      "The 26-year-old will have aspirations of making an immediate impact in his debut season at Old Trafford. He is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 role in Ruben Amorim's trademark 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Well-versed in a three-at-the-back formation, Cunha should be able to adapt to Amorim's methods and demands relatively comfortably. He is a specialist No.10 and is capable of making things happen.",
      "In his first interview as a United player that was released last Friday, Cunha opened up on how former Wolves boss Gary O'Neil's advice improved him as a player.",
      "Cunha said: \"At the time we changed the manager, he came in and told me, 'Matheus, I can only say to you, be a little bit more free'. He gave me all the confidence to play well.",
      "\"It was a little bit easier because I did well last season, 14 goals. I think I did this only because he came and said to me to be free, show yourself. They were important words for me. Coming from Atletico was a little bit hard.\"",
      "In charge at Molineux between August 2023 and December 2024, O'Neil got a consistent tune out of Cunha, with the former Atletico Madrid forward scoring 22 goals and registering 12 assists in 55 appearances under the 42-year-old.",
      "O'Neil's successor, Vitor Pereira, also managed to get the best out of Cunha, who scored nine goals and claimed three assists in 19 matches under his management.",
      "Establishing himself as a creative force, who thrives of both scoring and creating goals, it is hardly surprising United chief executive Omar Berrada is confident Cunha will be a player that gets United's supporters out of their seats.",
      "\"He's a player that I think fans are going to love,\" Berrada told United We Stand. \"We can talk about his technical abilities and he can play in three different positions.",
      "\"He's a playmaking attacking midfielder; he can score goals, he can make assists. I think he's going to lift people off their seats.",
      "\"He's got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, Cantona-esque.\"",
      "With Berrada hopeful Cunha will bring entertainment to Old Trafford, the attacker's comments about how O'Neil took him to a different level by allowing him to play with the shackles off should offer an insight to Amorim on how to get the best out of him.",
      "Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided playmaker spot and it will be from that role he will be determined to express himself and pick up from where he left off at Molineux."

      "The wage demands of Manchester United-linked striker Viktor Gyokeres have reportedly been revealed, though only because Juventus have burst onto the scene and are said to be well on their way to making an offer.",
      "Amid Ruben Amorim's search for a new striker to spearhead his United side, the speculation of a reunion with a familiar face has been incessant. Gyokeres was the scorer of 66 goals under the manager during 15 months together at Sporting CP, so the logic would be he resumes such a record at Old Trafford.",
      "But the process around the striker's exit has not been a simple one with 'fury' from the player himself over the actions of his club president, who had a frosty back-and-forth with his agent.",
      "Ultimately we are now said to be beyond that stage, and Sporting are ready to accept their No.9's move on the terms of a 'gentleman's agreement' below his €100m (£84m).",
      "Whilst Premier League rivals Arsenal have been the other team most-talked about at this stage, Corriere dello Sport now suggest Juventus are the new threat to watch out for.",
      "They explain how The Old Lady have seven players on their roster ready to be sold, including striker Dusan Vlahovic and midfielder Douglas Luiz. For that duo alone they wish to recoup €60m (£51m).",
      "They can then launch an €80m (£68m) offensive for Gyokeres, made up of a €70m (£59m) up front fee and €10m (£9m) worth of add-on bonuses.",
      "It is described as a 'complex web', but one 'worth weaving' due to the Sweden international's return of 97 goals over the past two seasons.",
      "Helping their cause has also been the past sales of Wojceich Szczesny, Federico Chiesa, Arthur Melo, Mattia De Sciglio and Tiago Djalo - all freeing up essential funds from Juve's wage bill.",
      "Their extra sales this summer means even more will be available, with the Italian publication adding that they will then be able to meet Gyokeres' expectation to earn €7.5m (£6.3m) per year as a player in Turin.",
      "That would equate to €145k (£120k) per week, and gives United their first indicator as how much Gyokeres may set them back in addition to the transfer fee involved.",
      "Scandinavian publication FotbollSkanalen add this would be a huge increase on the €2m (£1.7m) the 27-year-old takes home per year at Sporting.",
      "Finally, clearing up some discrepancies around the sell-on clause involved in the deal are Portuguese outlet A Bola.",
      "They understand that Sporting initially agreed to hand over 15 percent of their earnings from the future sale of Gyokeres to his former club, Championship club Coventry City.",
      "Last summer that dropped to 10 percent and although there were some reports that Coventry no longer had that agreement in play, they say it is still active and they still stand to make a 'significant' amount from the impending transfer.",
      "Meanwhile, Real Madrid are said to have turned down the chance to sign Gyokeres. According to The Athletic, Gyokeres was proposed to Real as they search for a new centre forward.",
      "But Los Blancos have decided against making a move. It's added that while Xabi Alonso's side 'like him', they ruled him out because of the potential cost and his demand to be a starter.",
      "United have already signed Matheus Cunha to boost Amorim's squad, with the club also hopeful of completing a deal for Bryan Mbeumo."

Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and while he scored in the Conference League final against Real Betis, the winger's time at Stamford Bridge was largely considered underwhelming.",
      "At the end of this season, it was no surprise to see Sancho and Chelsea fail to reach personal terms on a new contract. Despite being obligated to purchase the 25-year-old, the Blues agreed to pay United £5m to allow him to return to Old Trafford.",
      "This was seen as bad news for United who are keen to sell Sancho permanently this summer and now face the task of finding him a new home. Fortunately, an escape route to Italy has opened for the winger with journalist Gianluca di Marzio insisting that Napoli are interested in the England international.",
      "Napoli lost Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG in the January transfer window and were unable to sign a replacement then as United rejected a bid for Alejandro Garnacho. It now seems that his teammate is an option for Antonio Conte albeit there is reportedly a hurdle for that signature.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has been given a stark warning to prioritise his football over disagreements with his boss.",
      "The 20-year-old is expected to leave Manchester United this summer after reportedly being told he can seek a new club. The situation surrounding the young winger has become more intense amidst claims of a fallout with United head coach Ruben Amorim at the end of the season.",
      "Napoli had a £40million bid for the player rejected in January, highlighting his value to the club. However, it's thought a £70m approach would be enough to secure his exit.",
      "As Garnacho inches closer to leaving Old Trafford, former Liverpool forward Dean Saunders explained how he had heard about disagreements between the player and Amorim, as they were said to have rowed about tactics at United's training ground.",
      "The former Wrexham and Wolves boss criticised the player's choice to confront his head coach, while also expressing admiration for his playing ability. However, Garnacho's character is something that certainly bothers Saunders.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Saunders said: \"I like him as a player. He plays with his heart on his sleeve, and there's a load of them who don't at Man United. But from a good source, I heard he's arguing with the manager on the training pitch about tactics. How old is he, 20? Just get on with it.\"",
      "The focus at United this summer is very much on making squad improvements, with Amorim already welcoming Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is also very much being hunted, despite Thomas Frank's desire to lure him to Tottenham.",
      "Saunders has warned United that focusing on players' mentalities is key when making future signings, following Amorim's well-publicised rows with Garnacho and Marcus Rashford this season.",
      "He added: \"Man United have signed bad characters, and you've got to start signing good characters. Forget the talent. Obviously, you've got to have a certain amount to play at the level you're at, but they've got to concentrate on signing good characters, because they're shambolic at the moment.\"",
      "Garnacho has expressed a desire to remain in the UK if he leaves United this summer. Chelsea are understood to be leading the chase, with Arsenal and Aston Villa among the others reportedly interested.",
      "His former club Atletico Madrid are also eyeing a move, alongside Bayer Leverkusen, who recently appointed Erik ten Hag as their new manager. Any transfer fee for Garnacho would mean pure profit for United as a result of his status as a homegrown talent."

      "Whether that be agreeing new contracts or exploring deals for players to leave, United are already having a busy summer.",
      "Heaton is one player who has been rumoured to be heading for the exit door this summer. The goalkeeper's contract is set to expire at the end of the month, meaning he is just weeks away from becoming a free agent.",
      "United confirmed when they announced their retained list that they were in talks with Heaton over a potential extension.",
      "Now a fresh update has emerged about the 39-year-old's future as the end of June fast approaches.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported on X, formerly known as Twitter, that United have agreed a deal for Heaton to extend his contract at Old Trafford.",
      "The report claims that the agreement will see United extend Heaton's deal by 12 months until the summer of 2026, meaning he would no longer be leaving the club for free on June 30.",

      "Manchester United have been dealt a boost in the race for Viktor Gyokeres after Real Madrid rejected the chance to sign the Sporting CP forward.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, has emerged as a summer target for Ruben Amorim's side following an excellent season at Sporting, where he plundered 54 goals in 52 matches in all competitions.",
      "United are intent on signing a new No.9 to boost the club's attack this summer and Gyokeres is near the top of their shopping list, having worked with Amorim during their time together at Sporting.",
      "However, it has now appeared that Gyokeres has been offered to another team. According to The Athletic, the former Coventry City man has been proposed to Real Madrid as they search for a new centre forward.",
      "But Los Blancos have said 'no' and turned down the chance to sign Gyokeres. It's added that while Xabi Alonso's side 'like him', they ruled him out because of the potential cost and his demand to be a starter.",
      "The Spanish giants are instead in the market for a Joselu-type centre forward: a player who can make an impact in the box, could be signed for a low fee and would accept a back-up role to Kylian Mbappe.",
      "21-year-old forward Gonzalo Garcia, who is from the club's reserve team in the Spanish third division, is expected to be used as their second-choice striker behind Mbappe at the Club World Cup.",
      "As for Gyokeres, he is still expected to leave Sporting and seek a new adventure, almost a week on since the club's president revealed that there is no gentleman's agreement for him to leave for £59million.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" Frederico Varandas said in a press conference last Wednesday.",
      "\"To this day Sporting has not had an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last season.\"",
      "Reports in Portugal suggested that Gyokeres was left feeling 'disrespected' about the situation and won't return to Sporting for pre-season. It was added that the Swede would 'rather go on strike' and is willing to 'interrupt his vacation' to speak out about his situation and Sporting's agreement that was in place.",
      "Speaking last month, Sporting vice-president Francisco Salgado Zenha provided an update on Gyokeres' future and revealed the club are hoping to keep hold of him. He said: \"He has three more years on his contract. At the moment there are no offers, he has three more years on his contract.",
      "\"I think the answer has been given. [Sporting's transfer plans] won’t be any different from last year. We want to keep the best players and retain talent.",
      "\"We want to continue to be champions, have competitive teams and fight on all fronts. I have been in this role for seven years. In the years when Sporting were champions, we even made fewer sales than in other years... the fact that we are champions gives us a greater ability to retain players and talent.",
      "\"Coincidence or not, we have not had to sell any players in those times. Not that we have not received offers, but the market is not under our control, we are always dependent.\""

      "It's fair to say that Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim will have a much better squad to choose from than the one that ended the miserable 2024/25 season.",
      "After inheriting a poorly built squad in November, Amorim failed to get his ideas across for the most part and even after reaching the Europa League final, United ended their worst season in 51 years with little optimism.",
      "Work is already underway in ensuring a repeat of last term doesn't repeat itself. Matheus Cunha's £62.5million arrival from Wolves significantly improves the attacking midfielder slots behind the striker and there is no sign of stopping there.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and a new centre-forward are the priority now the window has reopened for business. Yet there needs to be balance and players must be sold to not only raise funds, but to make room in Amorim's squad.",
      "No European football means the necessity for a large squad is no longer needed. But what is clear is that by the time the Premier League season kicks off (weekend of 16 August), Amorim must have the best possible squad.",
      "The rules are the same as last year. At least eight players must be qualified as homegrown (someone who has 'featured for an FA-affiliated club for at least three years before turning 21') while a maximum of 17 can be non-homegrown.",
      "Players under the age of 21 (born on or after January 1, 2004) will also not count towards the 25-man selection. Given United's recruitment focus on talented wonderkids in the last 18 months, there is space.",
      "Andre Onana isn't a player that United are desperate to sell, and he could very well stay as Amorim's number one. However, in a dream world, a goalkeeper as good as Emiliano Martinez would be snapped up.",
      "The World Cup winner could leave Aston Villa, and reports in Argentina have claimed he is open to moving to the club. He's an improvement to Onana, meaning the Cameroon international will be sold.",
      "Altay Bayindir will remain as second choice with Elyh Harrison, who was named in eight senior matchday squads last season, named too.",
      "Amorim uses five defenders in his 3-4-2-1 formation, with the job of the wing-backs vital. Victor Lindelof's exit means there are only five natural centre-backs now, but Noussair Mazraoui's reliability to cover means they have six options for three positions.",
      "At wing-back, United could do with another signing. A new left-back has been tipped, but Denzel Dumfries is one player that would be perfect for the system.",
      "The Inter Milan star is a natural at bombing up and down the right, offering such a dangerous threat. Diogo Dalot could do with the competition, although the Portuguese would be the first choice at left wing-back due to Luke Shaw's injury record.",
      "Harry Amass will be hoping to get more minutes in the first-team during pre-season, or a loan move could be the play for the youngster.",
      "Adam Wharton, as many have said, would be perfect for United's midfield. However, even with Christian Eriksen leaving, one more player would have to depart, such as Casemiro, to free up the funds and space in the squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is a nailed-on starter after rejecting a move to Saudi Arabia, while Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are set to battle it out for a spot alongside the United captain. Wharton's arrival would provide even more competition.",
      "Amad is set to play a huge part this season, and Mason Mount's time at Old Trafford could come down to how successful he can be this season.",
      "However, it must be said, Wharton's signing could spell the end of one more player. Mainoo, who has been linked with a move away amid uncertainty over his contract, may be sacrificed, with him classed as pure profit on the books.",
      "There has to be a striker through the door this summer, and Viktor Gyokeres is the perfect man. Everything that has been said about what Amorim wants in a centre-forward points towards the Swede.",
      "The arrival of a new number nine would ultimately put an end to Rasmus Hojlund's time in England, although maybe only temporarily. Interest in Italy is growing, but whether the likes of Inter or Juventus could pay a permanent transfer.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee provides excellent back-up at centre-forward and behind the striker, with Chido Obi also an option for cup games and further senior minutes.",
      "Having both Cunha and Mbeumo behind a goalscoring-obsessed striker like Gyokeres would completely turn United's fortunes around in returning to the Champions League.",
      "Possible Man United 25-man Premier League squad: Martinez, Bayindir, De Ligt, Martinez, Maguire, Shaw, Dumfries, Dalot, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte, Mainoo, Mount, Amad, Cunha, Mbeumo, Gyokeres, Zirkzee.",

      "\"I've known Dave now for quite a few years and it's for good reasons,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe assured us. \"He is obsessive about performance in elite sports, and he is going to be very successful at Manchester United.\"",
      "No, he isn't. Had Brailsford not stepped back from his prominent position at United and the team become a success, none of it would have been down to him.",
      "Brailsford, as he admitted to Nasser Hussain in November 2023, is \"no football expert\". Ratcliffe complained about the \"rugby man\" Richard Arnold. Brailsford is a cycling guy. Arnold was more of a success during a fraught two years as chief executive.",
      "The chances are the majority reading this are more qualified than Brailsford to be on the United football board. Our football knowledge outweighs Brailsford's and that buzzphrase, 'high performance', is as meaningless as Brailsford's presence at United. He was not worthy of the Paul Smith-tailored club suit.",
      "United used sleep and meal windows, individually-tailored compression garments to increase blood circulation and a hydration plan in pre-season. That had Brailsford's fingerprints all over it. The finger of blame cannot be pointed solely at him for United then suffering their worst season in 51 years.",
      "Brailsford did not endear himself, either. His aloofness was so striking and not in keeping with other Ineos appointments. Dan Ashworth was personable during our sole sit-down with him, Omar Berrada is an engaging talker, Jason Wilcox has offered the odd \"hello\" and Toby Craig, the director of communications, can be loquacious in an appropriate setting.",
      "At Carrington once, Brailsford literally walked the other way when journalists approached him. When he used the wrong door to enter United's Beverly Hills hotel last summer, he completely blanked colleagues.",
      "Heads had to roll at United last season and one had to be in the hierarchy. Brailsford was a logical fall-guy, whatever the spin that it was always part of the plan that he would return to his wheelhouse of cycling. Ratcliffe's promise in February 2024 that Brailsford would be \"very successful\" undermines that script.",
      "Throughout Brailsford's 18 months at United, nobody at the club provided a satisfactory rationale for his presence. The closest was from Ashworth in response to a query from this correspondent.",
      "Ashworth billed Brailsford as a de facto performance director, someone United would tap into to get the squad back up to speed. Brailsford was billed as a \"genius\" by Ashworth in September and mentioned in the same breath as Berrada, Wilcox and Erik ten Hag among the management team.",
      "This columnist queried Brailsford's role again in March and recommended he be dismissed last month. United are getting there.",
      "MBEUMO: RIGHT MAN FOR THE RIGHT WING",
      "At the risk of embarking on a victory lap, yours truly wrote in November 2023, \"While the focus is inevitably on Ivan Toney, if United are to telephone Brentford about a player it ought to be Bryan Mbeumo.\"",
      "The piece centred on United's need for a diligent and pure right winger. That position has been an unfixable problem since Antonio Valencia assumed the number seven shirt in 2012 and was so cursed by it he requested to revert to his old number 25 after one season.",
      "Wilfried Zaha, Adnan Januzaj, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Daniel James, Mason Greenwood and Antony all had purple patches. In Zaha's case, it was merely a propitious pre-season. Then he was restricted to two competitive starts.",
      "Januzaj was mismanaged, Mkhitaryan was a mismatch, James was a cost-efficient punt, Greenwood was all-but-excommunicated and Antony was execrable. Diogo Dalot, a right back by trade, is more of a defender than an attacker.",
      "If United get Mbeumo, he has to occupy the right wing. The majority of his starts came there in a career-best season for Brentford, albeit predominantly in a 4-2-3-1 formation, and United need attacking nous on the flanks.",
      "Some still call them 'wing backs'. Look at Amorim's set-up at Sporting. The wide players were wingers as the system is geared up to service the striker. Mbeumo is such a multi-functional talent he can operate as an attacker or a defender, he is that reliable.",
      "Going to United, the pressure would be tenfold. Only three players scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in 2024-25 and if he gets 10 for United - half the 20 he tallied for Brentford - it will be a creditable contribution.",
      "United do not require all-change in the two playmaker roles and it would be drastic to have a completely new front three. Amad offers continuity, with Bruno Fernandes seemingly set for a central midfield remit if he stays.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad could dovetail on that right-hand side. The 3-4-2-1 has been rigid when it should be fluid and Mbeumo would assist that transition from pragmatism to proactivism. If United are defending a lead, he is the one you want in your own third.",
      "It was nearly four years ago that Mbeumo scored at Old Trafford in a 2-2 pre-season friendly as masked fans were invited back into stadiums. He deftly cushioned a clipped ball past Dalot, had two more touches to adjust the angle and curled the ball beyond the reach of Tom Heaton. Mbeumo was playing on the right wing.",
      "Mbeumo overtook Dalot in 2021 and may do so again in 2025.",
      "STRIKER STRIFE?",
      "United missed out on Liam Delap but he will not be missed. He has excellent attributes but they did not need a striker four days younger than Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Delap's move to Chelsea could risk United's striker search descending into that dreaded word - saga - this summer. Number 9s who have created a market for themselves will want to be linked with United, whether it is concrete or baseless, and the more names the more chaotic it appears.",
      "That is not on United. They had contingency plans in place before Delap rejected them and are seldom responsible for the flurry of stories that emerge in the close season.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo are targets to strengthen the first team but a striker is an absolute priority. It does not always mean they are first through the door. Last year, the most important position for United to address was defensive midfield and the signing of Manuel Ugarte was not announced until gone 9pm on deadline day.",
      "United had to wait for one to go out (Scott McTominay) for one to come in. Fulham did not get close to McTominay's valuation before Napoli muscled in. McTominay left United on the same day that Ugarte officially arrived.",
      "Signing two centre halves, a right back and one striker (who it turned out was not a striker) after ending the 2023-24 campaign with a minus goal difference was patently the wrong balance. The mitigation is Joshua Zirkzee had a release clause and Anthony Martial's outstayed welcome had expired. United also had the leverage to recruit Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui as Raphael Varane and Aaron Wan-Bissaka had made room.",
      "Leny Yoro was the real showstopper. So much so senior figures at Everton were surprised United suddenly stopped bidding for Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo will cost United well north of £100million. They also have, technically, two strikers, so someone has to make way.",
      "At least Inter Milan have enquired about Hojlund."

The club completed the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha last week, have had a bid totalling £55m rejected for Bryan Mbeumo by Brentford and are in the market for a new starting striker.",
      "Sancho has made one competitive appearance for United since he accused former manager Erik ten Hag of lying over his omission from the matchday squad for the defeat to Arsenal in September 2023. Sancho spent the second half of the 2023-24 campaign on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund before his season-long loan at Chelsea last term. Sancho's United contract expires next year.",
      "Antony, who moved to United for a fee rising to £86.3m in September 2022, started three times for the club last season before he moved to Betis in January. The winger excelled in Spain and was recalled to the Brazil squad after an absence of almost two years earlier this month.",
      "Rashford's spell at Villa was cut short by a hamstring injury in April. He scored four goals in 17 appearances and Villa are not expected to sign him permanently. United figures expect Rashford to move abroad.",

They are also confident in adding Bryan Mbeumo to Amorim's team with the Brentford star understood to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite interest from Thomas Frank's Tottenham.",
      "Further down the line, a new striker remains a priority. United recorded their worst goalscoring season in 35 years last term and their intention to recruit one early in the window hit a stumbling block after Liam Delap joined Chelsea.",
      "Unsurprisingly, signings are the priority for United. Should Mbeumo arrive, the focus could shift more towards selling players to raise funds for further reinforcements. Worryingly, no asset has come close to leaving.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are all players United will, in a dream scenario, sell to bring in an estimated £155m. Garnacho, who United reportedly want £70m for, is the big one after his antics at the end of the season.",
      "Their exit would give Amorim the green light to get his hands on his new striker. Right now, it's unclear who that will be but Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen fit the mould that the United boss desires.",
      "Reports from The Athletic have claimed Amorim wants a striker who can play with his back to goal, work as a hook for others to play-off him, have explosive pace, turn half-chances into goals and score a high volume of goals. That criteria does spark concern over the likes of Hugo Ekitike, who is similar to Joshua Zirkzee.",

At the back, United's best back three of Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez is strong but the addition of Aymeric Laporte or Goncalo Inacio would only make them better.",

      "\"Having impressed in France and on the international stage, Boudaoui could be the perfect fit. He is a physical presence and someone that loves a tackle and a block.\""

      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened for business, meaning Manchester United have between now and 7pm on September 1 to get all of their shopping done.",
      "After opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period for the Club World Cup, the window temporarily closed last Tuesday evening, marking a six-day pause in transfer activity. However, it will now remain open without any further interruptions.",
      "Despite a temporary pause, that did not stop United from officially announcing the arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million last Thursday. United had announced they had reached an agreement with their Premier League counterparts to sign him on June 1.",
      "Cunha had been a long-term target for United, meaning they are delighted to have secured his signature nice and early. He should be the first of a handful of new recruits at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "In securing Cunha's signature so early, United made their mark on the window quickly, highlighting just how keen they are to show some ambition.",
      "As well as getting a deal in place to sign Cunha prior to the temporary closure, they also made their first move for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They saw an opening offer of £55m turned down just under a fortnight ago but talks between the two clubs remain ongoing.",
      "Mbeumo has informed Brentford's hierarchy that Old Trafford is his preferred destination this summer. However, United are yet to table a second bid for the Cameroon international.",
      "However, since the window temporarily closed last Tuesday, Tottenham Hotspur have also been credited with interest in Mbeumo. That was almost inevitable after Spurs recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach.",
      "Despite having an excellent relationship with Frank, Mbeumo is understood to be determined to move to Old Trafford. United want to strengthen their attacking options this summer and adding the versatile attacker to the addition of Cunha would be a real statement of intent.",
      "It is believed Brentford are holding out for a fee similar to what United paid for Cunha, although the Brazilian was signed via a release clause. United would like to sign Mbeumo ahead of pre-season starting in July.",
      "Elsewhere, United remain determined to sign a striker this summer. After missing out on Liam Delap earlier this month, they have been linked with a crop of alternative options, including the likes of Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and most recently Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Whoever United plan to try and make their first-choice No.9 will be dependent on outgoings. The prospect of signing Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m will take their spending past the £120m mark before sanctioning any sales.",
      "United are also keen to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. Head coach Ruben Amorim wants a new shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also possible.",
      "Much of what United will be able to do on the incoming front will rest on outgoings. Preparing to oversee up to ten departures, United have a collection of players they would like to offload this summer.",
      "The Reds have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales. Each of them spent time out on loan in 2024/25 and United want to offload them permanently ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available at £32.5m and Sancho could command a fee of somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty clause to break their obligation to sign him permanently.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Old Trafford for the right price. Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for him back in January, meaning United are expected to ask for a fee north of £50m.",
      "The former is attracting interest from Inter Milan and it remains to be seen if they will submit a formal offer for the Denmark international. He scored just ten goals for United in 2024/25."

      "The swap rumour linking Victor Osimhen with Liverpool is straight into the top 10…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Brahim Diaz – Real Madrid to Manchester United\nWe don’t think this is even the first time Diaz has used supposed interest from United as leverage in contract talks. Maybe it’s done the trick since reports suggest the attacker has agreed a new deal. Nothing doing.",
      "",
      "19) 🆕 Jarrad Branthwaite – Everton to Tottenham\nAre Tottenham and Manchester United using the same scouts? Will Spurs be linked with Nicolas Gaitan next? Or maybe Wesley Sneijder? Regardless, Everton have told everyone the defender is not for sale. Given they priced out United last year when he probably was up for grabs, we can forget this one for now unless Branthwaite kicks up a fuss.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Napoli\nWe almost want this to happen just to see Antonio Conte’s head fall off by Christmas. We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli.",
      "",
      "17) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Manchester United\nTottenham were linked with the Bournemouth attacker and now United apparently have him in their sights if Mbeumo chooses a reunion with Thomas Frank at Spurs. Eberechi Eze is also an alternative target. This is a long way from being a thing.",
      "",
      "",
      "15) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nWith Nico Williams preferring to join Barcelona, the Arsenal-Rodrygo links are resurfacing, The Brazilian is at the Club World Cup with Real Madrid but the Gunners’ interest is ‘genuine’ and ‘exploratory talks’ have taken place.",
      "",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Wirtz next? The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThere was a report from Record in Portugal that Gyokeres had told United he wasn’t interested, but others dispute that claim. Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",
      "",
      "13) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "12) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. There is plenty of noise coming from Barca, but nothing Liverpool can take to the bank.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Alexander Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation and the fact that the Brazilian’s mate says he wants to live in London. Hide all the maps, lads.",
      "MORE: Top 10 wingers available this summer features Arsenal, Liverpool targets and Man Utd outcast",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Liverpool\nApparently, Liverpool are looking to offer Darwin Nunez and Federico Chiesa to Napoli in exchange for the Nigeria striker. Which actually makes sense. We know Napoli like Nunez, who would either be a huge hit or a massive flop in Naples – there’s no middle ground. Swap deals don’t happen anymore – unless they a PSR tickle – but this could actually work, if there’s any truth in it.",
      "",
      "9) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s asking price. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nThis appears to be gathering pace rather quickly. Atletico Madrid have made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical is scheduled for Monday, so we’re told.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool will reportedly pay a British record £116.9m for Wirtz. That’s a lot of wonga for everyone to get very worked up about. Regardless, we are now at the point of arranging a medical, which is set for Friday, apparently. Stand by your flight trackers, Reds.",

      "“We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men’s first team but we are committed to making the women’s team very successful. You’ve heard Jim say, if you’re wearing the United shirt then you must win, and that’s exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and to contribute to women’s football.",
      "“Overall, it’s establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. And if you ask me today, can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "“We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power? There have been other turnarounds and other big teams have had bad seasons and gone on to win the Premier League or La Liga.”",
      "He added: “I firmly believe that we can do it (win the Premier League in 2028).",

      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "United have improved their attack already this summer, after they were very underwhelming in the Premier League last season. The top goalscorers scored just eight goals, and between strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, just seven were scored.",
      "Matheus Cunha has come through the door in a £62.5million transfer, and if Bryan Mbeumo follows, United’s attack will look much stronger.",
      "The Red Devils have been heavily linked with the Brentford forward of late, as it’s been revealed he wants to play at Old Trafford.",
      "But Tottenham moves have thrown a spanner into the works, as they have hired Mbeumo’s former boss, Thomas Frank, and it’s believed the forward is now intrigued by a transfer there.",
      "The report suggests Mbeumo is leaving towards United, and after their last bid for the forward was rejected, they are ‘expected’ to go back in for him soon.",
      "It’s suggested that the Cameroon keeper has swayed Mbeumo in the direction of United.",
      "Onana has played with the forward on 15 occasions for the national team, winning seven of those. They did not play together in the recent international fixtures, though.",
      "Whether Onana is still at United to play with Mbeumo once he arrives remains to be seen. The United goalkeeper was at fault for a number of goals last season, and as a result, his club are being linked with a number of new stoppers.",
      "Emi Martinez and Marc-Andre ter Stegen are among them. It has recently been stated that United have ‘initiated’ direct talks for Aston Villa keeper Martinez, and it’s believed he is eager to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "If he joined, he’d certainly be a better option than Onana, and the Cameroonian would not want to be second choice, so might well leave Old Trafford in search of opportunities, which it seems will be available to him in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",

      "After a 15th-placed finish in last season’s Premier League, United might need more reinforcements.",
      "And they have been given some level of confidence that a transfer could be possible.",
      "The report suggests that manager Inzaghi’s departure to Saudi Arabia has Frattesi ‘more than ever considering leaving’.",
      "It’s believed he’s disappointed by his lack of playing time last season – though he played 47 times in all competitions – and has sent a ‘clear message’ to his entourage to begin discussions with ‘potentially interested clubs’.",
      "That could give United hope that a move for the midfielder – who scored seven goals and assisted two more last term – could move there.",
      "That said, there is competition from Napoli, and they could have the best chance of landing Frattesi. Antonio Conte is said to have identified the midfielder as a ‘priority’ and Frattesi himself is ‘prioritising’ Serie A, as he’d rather stay in Italy than leave.",
      "That would seemingly put the Italian champions at the top of his list.",
      "A potential United exit could help their cause, though. The Dane has been a target of Inter for a while, and it’s been reported recently that he is ‘ahead of everyone’ on their priority list and there has been an ‘acceleration’ for the transfer of late.",
      "If Inter are to be given an easier route to Hojlund, they could potentially return the favour and allow United the chance to land Frattesi.",
      "His preference could make or break a deal, though. It’s believed the Inter midfielder will command a fee of €35million (£29.8m), but while that should not be hard to come by, he could reject the chance to sign for United in favour of a Serie A club.",
      "That figure should also not be hard for Napoli to pay, after they won the title last season, so there’s a chance the Red Devils are out of luck.",

      "Manchester United have been informed that they can sign Liverpool and Chelsea target Hugo Ekitike in a ‘flexible deal’ as they look to reduce his fee.",
      "United‘s summer priority is to overhaul their attack after they massively struggled to score goals last season. They only netted 28 goals from open play last season as they struggled to create chances and their forwards suffered a crisis of confidence.",
      "Man Utd have also taken a step in the right direction with the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for around £62.5m, and top target Bryan Mbeumo would be another upgrade in the No.10 position as they look to beat Spurs to secure his services.",
      "The Red Devils are also crying out for a new striker as Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee only scored seven Premier League goals between them during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "United are known to be admirers of 2025 top scorer in Europe contender Viktor Gyokeres, but Eintracht Frankfurt star Ekitike has emerged as a potential alternative as the Frenchman is coming off a 22-goal campaign for the Bundesliga outfit.",

      "Liverpool and Chelsea are also interested in Ekitike, with Fabrizio Romano revealing the Premier League champions’ stance on signing him as a replacement for Darwin Nunez.",
      "Romano said: “With Darwin leaving, Ekitike is a concrete target for Liverpool. Liverpool already spoke to the agents of the player at the end of May.",
      "“Liverpool are in regular contact with people close to Hugo Ekitike, so for sure Ekitike remains a player on Liverpool’s list.",

      "Man Utd are also sniffing for Ekitike, with The Athletic reporting that they have made an ‘enquiry about his availability’.",
      "Frankfurt are said to be standing firm on their €100 million (£85m) asking price, but they are open to letting Ekitike leave in a ‘flexible deal’.",
      "This boosts Man Utd’s chances of landing Ekitike as their summer spend will likely surpass £120m if/when they sign Mbeumo and a report from Caught Offside claims they are ‘considering’ a ‘swap deal’ and have ‘identified’ two players to offload to Frankfurt.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘For now, Man Utd are yet to open formal talks with Eintracht Frankfurt over the talented young French striker, but they have been made aware of his €100m asking price. This is also true of Chelsea and Liverpool, who are also interested in Ekitike this summer, but for now nothing is at a particularly advanced stage with any club.",

Sources have confirmed to CaughtOffside that a swap deal is not being ruled out, with United open to using Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee as part of their offer for Ekitike.’",

      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out.",
      "",
      "10) Lucas Digne (unknown)\nIt seems curious for Atletico Madrid to lead their transfer philosophy on old Marco Silva quotes dredging up the Merseyside rivalry between Digne and Andy Robertson, but Diego Simeone has his methods.",
      "If Robertson cannot be procured on a cheap basis from Liverpool then Digne is a suitable alternative: 31, with a contract expiring soon, abundant experience and a skillset which could thrive in La Liga.",
      "Unai Emery might ordinarily be loathe to lose a player who started 37 Premier and Champions League games last season, but with Ian Maatsen ready to step up and £5.9m teenage signing Yasin Ozcan capable of moving into that back-up void, it could be a perfect opportunity to trim a ludicrous wage bill.",
      "",
      "9) Milos Kerkez (£45m)\nAnother domino fell in The Great Left-Back Transfer Exchange when Bournemouth completed the signing of Adrien Truffert from Rennes, who themselves have brought in Lilian Brassier to help cover a side vacated by their erstwhile captain.",
      "Whether Robertson remains at Anfield or not, his Liverpool starting place will be lost either way when Kerkez is finally picked from the Cherries, who have moved decisively for their own replacement.",
      "“It’s a dream for any player to play in the Premier League,” said Truffert upon his £11.4m switch to the south coast. “It’s a great opportunity for me to keep progressing and to be part of an ambitious project.”",
      "It is also, crucially, a wide-open berth on his side of the defence. Kerkez has shown the power of the Bournemouth stepping stone and it was a contractual obligation to describe his current employers as ‘paving the way’ for the Hungarian to leave for Liverpool with a necessary Truffert shuffle.",
      "",
      "8) Mateo Joseph (£13m)\n“There was a change, the other striker started to play. I started playing quite a bit and then went from everything to nothing. It was a blow,” said young Joseph of a season in which he started the first eight Championship games, then three of the next 16 and none of the final 22.",
      "Having played all but seven of the club’s league matches en route to promotion, yet ranking 16th for minutes played in the squad, the hint has been entirely taken and Real Betis are hoping they have found a cost-efficient Antony equivalent.",
      "Eight goals in 11 Spain U21 caps suggest he could flourish in a more comfortable environment yet it seems unlikely Leeds and Daniel Farke would trust Joseph any more in the Premier League than they did on the journey there.",
      "It might be that the free transfer capture of Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg was a signal of intent to cash in on Joseph if enough can be raised through his sale for necessary reinforcements.",
      "",
      "7) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (£30m)\nThere is an element of sympathy for Dewsbury-Hall, the usual comfort blanket signing made by a manager climbing up the football ladder, who was discarded almost as soon as Enzo Maresca unpacked.",
      "But there is equally a sense that he really ought to have known things could turn out this way for a big fish in the little pond at Leicester when dropped into the shark-infested transfer ocean of Chelsea.",
      "Including the Club World Cup, with Dewsbury-Hall an inevitable unused substitute in the opening game, the midfielder ranked 15th for minutes played this season at Chelsea.",
      "Remove from the equation the Conference League – in which he finished the full 90 minutes in nine of 12 games and started 11 before coming on as a late substitute in the final – and he comes 22nd behind Benoit Badiashile.",
      "That is his reality with Champions League qualification secured. Dario Essugo has arrived from Sporting and immediately established himself as the Moises Caicedo understudy guaranteed a great many minutes. Dewsbury-Hall knows the bomb squad treatment awaits unless he accepts his fate of a move to Burnley or West Ham or some such.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Kovacic (£25.5m)\nTijjani Reijnders has already dismissed the idea he is “here to replace” Kevin de Bruyne, and 19 goals with nine assists in 104 Milan appearances, while admirable, do not scream attacking midfield genius.",
      "“A lot of times I watched Kevin but another player I can learn a lot of things from is Gundogan. It is nice to see him up close and see how he does it,” said Reijnders of a more apt comparison. But it feels as though Kovacic has the most to lose in this sudden midfield evolution at the Etihad.",
      "The return of Rodri to the fold was bound to reduce the chances for his midfield companions but it is easy to envisage how responsibilities might otherwise be shared between Reijnders, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, weird FA Cup final substitute Claudio Echeverri, forgotten January signing Nico Gonzalez and academy graduate Nico O’Reilly.",
      "For Kovacic, any answer beyond an exit with his transitional purpose under Pep Guardiola served is less obvious.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson (£60m)\nA West Ham loan under Graham Potter did nothing to resuscitate the career of Ferguson, who nevertheless seems destined for another hopeful loan. Given the current choice of Everton or Celtic, he might be in no rush to make a decision.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler seemed open to the idea of working with Ferguson in January but accepted his desire for more minutes and a change of surroundings. Yet his short stay at West Ham only deepened the sense of a player having lost his way.",
      "And Brighton know they cannot stand still and wait for the 20-year-old to realise his potential, hence the double down on teenage orthodox Greek forwards in January signing Stefanos Tzimas and £29.8m Olympiacos prodigy Charalampos Kostoulas.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke (£51.1m)\nWith Chelsea having already made a faintly ludicrous five signings for almost £100m this summer, their planned 14-player exodus will proceed as planned to sate their weird transfer fetish.",
      "As one of the longest-serving players in the squad, Madueke has had his turn and is among those for whom the club will listen to offers while not actively and desperately seeking a sale.",
      "A prohibitive price narrows Madueke’s options considerably with Chelsea wanting around double what they paid in January 2023 for a forward with 20 goals and nine assists in 88 appearances since.",
      "But nowhere are new toys shinier than at Stamford Bridge and there is a particular sparkle emanating from 18-year-old Brazilian winger Estevao Willian, who will link up with his new employers and take someone’s place upon the conclusion of the Club World Cup.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish (£40m)\n“I’m not Kevin De Bruyne,” revealed Rayan Cherki. “He is the legend.”",
      "But the Ballon d’Or-chasing Frenchman might well be the successor to Jack Grealish as the exciting, absurdly talented wide forward who is destined to be accused at some point of being ruined by Guardiola and turned into a backwards-passing robot.",
      "“Today’s game is less beautiful, fewer mistakes, but also fewer risks taken,” Cherki added in what could quite easily have been interpreted as a dig at his new manager. “I want to bring that spark back and give kids the joy it once had.”",
      "It was a battle Grealish fought and quite convincingly lost in the end, to the extent there are precious few takers at a considerable knock-down price this summer for a player Manchester City absolutely no longer want.",
      "",
      "2) Christopher Nkunku (£35m)\nIt was something of a surprise to see Nkunku given some cameo minutes against LAFC, the forward having been imbued with the aura of a pre-match chat with a beshirted Olivier Giroud.",
      "But that might well be where his Chelsea odyssey ends, considering Liam Delap proved his almost immediate suitability to the Enzo Maresca cause in a way many have struggled before him.",
      "Delap stands to take the permanent place of Nicolas Jackson, as he did from the bench in that impressive Club World Cup cameo. But the Senegal forward has shown enough to remain a fine squad option, dropping down the pecking order to knock Nkunku out of it entirely.",
      "“I think it is always healthy to have competition, it is football,” Delap said after the game. “The good thing about Liam is that he knows the way we want to play, so the process is quite quick,” Maresca added, with Nkunku having no part to play in a bright future.",
      "",
      "1) Rasmus Hojlund (£38m)\nThe complexion will change again once Harry Kane definitely joins Manchester United, but there are no feasible scenarios which benefit Hojlund in this transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has neither the time nor the patience to invest on a project, even with his public admiration of a 22-year-old who has never lacked in attitude and application.",
      "But Manchester United renewing an old transfer policy betrays their need to sign players who are as close to a guarantee of quality in the current day as possible. Matheus Cunha ticks all the boxes Hojlund cannot yet wish to.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish could join another Manchester City star in joining Everton this summer as Kyle Walker has ‘agreed a sensational’ move.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish’s proposed move from Manchester City to Napoli hinges on Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Premier League giants Arsenal have been urged to sanction another raid on rivals Manchester City to reunite Mikel Arteta with a former player.",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola has offered Citizens winger Jack Grealish to La Liga side Barcelona for £34m, according to reports."

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer – and even the Premier League champions could let one go.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "Arsenal ‘remain in contact’ with Benjamin Sesko’s representatives but are ‘not willing’ to meet RB Leipzig’s asking price, according to reports.",
      "Put yourself in Andrea Berta’s shiny, handcrafted brogues and tell us which striker you would sign for Arsenal this summer…",
      "A new report has revealed Arsenal’s striker “priority” during this summer’s transfer window, with a journalist revealing what he’s “known for a month”.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘opened a direct channel’ as they look to sign Napoli star Victor Osimhen in a ‘sensational swap deal’.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have submitted a higher ‘offer’ than FC Barcelona as the Premier League giants look to sign a long-term target.",
      "The longer Viktor Gyokeres’ future remains undecided, the more clubs join Arsenal in pursuing an interest in one of Europe’s most potent strikers."

If Rayan Cherki ends up doing skills on the edge of the pitch and losing the ball when City are 1-0 (like he often did at Lyon) he will feel like wasted money even though it was a small fee. If Wirtz scores the winner in a Champions League final it will feel worth it. That’s just how it works.",
      "If the player does the job they were brought in to do he’s worth it. Allison for example was brought in for an enormous price because we hadn’t had a keeper who can stop one on ones and distribute the ball well in a decade, Allison did that and much more so nobody ever talks about the price.",
      "If a player doesn’t do the job they’re brought in to do, they’re not worth it. Liverpool don’t have too many of these anymore but Nunez and Naby Keita are two that spring to mind who weren’t worth it.",
      "And it largely doesn’t matter what the price was. If Nunez cost £1 he still didn’t score enough goals so he would still not be worth it. If Van Dijk cost £200m he still led the team to many trophies and did all the things we needed him to do, so he would still be worth it.",
      "Is any United fan really gonna tell me that if Antony cost a quid they believe he would be a good players who brings something to the team it doesn’t already have? If Jack Grealish didn’t cost £100m would he be a better player for City?\nLee",

      "Declan Rice: Overrated\nI wanted to share some opinions on Declan Rice. First of all, he seems like a great bloke, and a footballer you’d definitely want to have a pint with. However he isn’t good enough to play DM for England or Arsenal.",
      "Some Arsenal fans have this weird obsession with comparing their players with Rodri. I was told Partey was better than Rodri after the former joined Arsenal in 2020 (he wasn’t). And then they repeated the trick when announcing that Rice is better than Rodri after Arsenal signed him in 2023. Partey was now, no longer worthy of comparison strangely. And I bet that they will say that Zubimendi is better than Rodri if he signs for Arsenal as planned.",
      "The weirdest bit is that Arteta doesn’t play Rice at DM. He played Partey or Jorginho instead, and has bought Zubimendi, as he knows Rice isn’t good enough to play DM at a team that wants to compete at the highest level. So it makes no sense to compare Rice to Rodri, when Rice is a box to box number 8 now, that compliments his physical strengths.",
      "If we assume that Tuchel will end up playing 4-3-3, as most of the English players he can pick play in that formation I find it weird how high Rice is rated in the England Ladder.",
      "When Rice played DM for England at the Euros, the back 4 ended up playing the ball left and right in a horseshoe shape as Rice wasn’t showing for the ball. He pretty much man marked the opposition and took himself out of the game. He wasn’t on the half turn, he didn’t get into space quick enough when pressed and his first touch isn’t good enough. As a result England couldn’t transition from defence to midfield when pressed. What England need is a proper DM for that role. We tried Angel Gomes and I still have hopes for Wharton, but we need someone who can play that role properly.",
      "Then England need two other midfielders and this is where Rice should play. But if everyone was fit and on form, and with a proper DM, would Rice be in the team ahead of all but one of Bellingham, Palmer, Foden, Eze, Rogers or Mainoo? Bellingham, when not being stroppy, provides the physicality that Rice does, so there should be a space for a more creative player next to him. Personally, I’d choose Palmer, so I’m surprised that Rice is number 3 on the ladder.",
      "TL;DR – Rice seems like a nice bloke, but isn’t a DM, shouldn’t be compared to Rodri, and shouldn’t play DM for England, and has a battle IMO to keep his England place in a midfield 3 if everyone is fit.\nAndy D. Manchester. MCFC",

All you have to do is look at the players when they win whatever trophy it is and that will tell you whether it’s ‘worth’ it or not. FA Cup, Coca-Cola Cup, Charity Shield, Super Cup…..the players that win those trophies quite clearly think they are worth winning.",

No one’s amazed that Trent can speak Spanish (it is after all one of the easier languages to learn – not if you’re Gareth Bale tho). No Johnny, what people were shocked by was it was so clean & without flaws that it clearly meant that he’d been learning it for quite some time – let’s say a lot longer than when Real first approached Liverpool back in January. Which means his decision to join Real has probably been taken long time ago & he could’ve even met privately with people from the club to discuss a potential move, whilst firmly a contracted Liverpool player.",
      "I think that will be the real kicker for Liverpool fans – it’s not like he’s had his head turned in January by Real’s interest but that he’s probably been sounded out by people at Madrid several years ago & he’s just allowed his contract to run down.",

I’ve travelled most of the world and I’ve English, Americans and australians all in foreign countries just using English with little to no attempt at the local language. This isn’t just my opinion either, the locals I speak to on my travels are always surprised when I can speak their language (Portuguese, Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese in case you’re curious) and they’re surprised because English speaking people don’t usually make the effort.",

      "I currently reside in Brasil and local faces light up when they learn I’m not a brasileiro and speak it well. In fact the only places where people don’t seem to appreciate that effort is Paris (where they have actual disdain if you attempt french and would rather you use English) and in the UK where people swat someone attempt at English aside like it’s a simple thing.",
      "So perhaps Johnny , the reason everyone is surprised at Trents Spanish is because the English aren’t known for their linguistic skills…Joey Barton speaking french is how it often turns out.\nLee",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘put an offer of £127m on the table’ for Barcelona star Raphinha as the Red Devils ‘strike a blow to the market’.",
      "Amorim is working closely with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to rebuild an ailing squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "The focus is very much on attacking players in the transfer market, with Matheus Cunha already joining the club after the Red Devils triggered his £62.5m release clause to land him from Wolves.",
      "Having been beaten to the signing of Liam Delap – who impressed on his debut for Chelsea on Monday – they’re also scouring the market for a new No.9, though their pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres appears to have ended after the striker told them where to go.",
      "They’ve had one bid rejected for Bryan Mbeumo of £55m plus a further £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford, and are considering an improved bid amid competition from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham.",
      "And now, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, the Red Devils have made a genuinely unbelievable ‘offer of €150m [£127m] for Raphinha’, having found some loose change down the back of one of their canteen chairs now collecting dust in a warehouse.",
      "‘The figure has surprised even in the Camp Nou offices’ the report admits, ‘where a proposal of such magnitude was not expected by the Brazilian winger’.",
      "No mention of the dire financial straits that Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed would have seen Manchester United go “bust by Christmas” had he not stopped providing lunches for staff though, nor their failure to qualify for European competition next season to further increase their woes, with the report instead stating that ‘the interest of the English team responds to its desire to strike a blow to the market’.",
      "United supposedly ‘see in Raphinha a piece that could make a difference from day one’ and that ‘his experience in the Premier League, after his time at Leeds United, makes his adaptation to the rhythm and demands of English football not unknown’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Although Barça does not contemplate easily parting with one of its most decisive players – with 34 goals and 25 assists in 57 games this season – the economic dimension of the offer forces the club to reflect. United’s proposal comes at a time when the Barcelona entity needs financial balance, and that income would be an opportunity difficult to ignore.’",
      "By far the strangest claim in the report appears to be an assertion that ‘United’s sporting situation’, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League last season – could actually be a factor in persuading him to leave Barcelona for Old Trafford.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘It remains to know Raphinha’s position. At 28 years old, the Brazilian is in the best moment of his career, and although he has shown commitment to Flick’s project, United’s sporting situation could weigh on his decision.’",
      "Absurd.",
      "Barcelona forward Raphinha is against any move to bring Liverpool winger Luis Diaz to the Camp Nou this summer, according to reports.",

      "According to reports, a ‘last-minute offer’ to Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has ‘boosted’ FC Barcelona and done the Spanish giants a ‘favour’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City are among two potential destinations for Barcelona star Raphinha, who has ‘offers on the table to leave’.",

      "Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid\nFinishing 19th in the 2019 Ballon d’Or vote – and collecting more career votes than Paul Scholes in the process – planted a seed in the mind of Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Zero points from his next and most recent shortlist appearance in 2022 helped crystallise a decision he would formalise three years later, dragging him kicking and screaming (in fluent Spanish) away from his Anfield home.",
      "In hindsight, publicly and proudly picking a Ballon d’Or win over becoming Liverpool captain, lifting the World Cup with England or claiming a second Champions League was the first sign for the Reds that simply being the sole Scouser in their team was not enough to sate some grandiose life goals.",
      "“I want to be the first full-back to ever do it,” he said of his Ballon d’Or ambition, adding that his desire was to be remembered as “a legend of football, someone who changed the game” with a “legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football”.",
      "Jan Kromkamp has a lot to answer for.",
      "With Michael Owen in 2001 still the only winner of the award as a Liverpool player, and Real Madrid offering a platform to more individual champions than any other club in history, it was not difficult to see where Alexander-Arnold was signalling and manoeuvring with his career crossroads on the horizon.",
      "Conducted in October 2024 at a time Alexander-Arnold was supposedly locked in negotiations with Liverpool over extending a contract due to expire in the summer, it might as well have been an exit interview.",
      "Alexander-Arnold did downplay the Ballon d’Or lure at his Real unveiling, saying he was not sure it “influenced my decision to come here at all” as “it is going to be quite hard to win the Ballon d’Or with the amount of superstars in this team”.",
      "But he also claimed to have been learning Spanish for “a few months”, and said he “grew up watching Real Madrid win three Champions League titles in a row” despite literally appearing in the last of those finals, so his status as a reliable narrator is uncertain.",
      "",
      "Rayan Cherki joining Manchester City\n“I want to win the Ballon d’Or and win the Champions League,” reads and sounds like a bold but feasible set of objectives laid out by Cherki as a new Manchester City signing.",

      "The Frenchman understandably never came close to enacting that plan in a solid but unspectacular Lyon side, but the Manchester City spotlight was a specific driving factor in his £30.5m summer switch.",
      "“When you see Rodri win the Ballon d’Or it is clear with Manchester City it is possible to do so and I am here for this,” he said in his first Etihad interview.",

      "But it remains a holy grail of sorts – and a key motivation behind his decision to resist Saudi Arabia overtures and continue at Liverpool with a new contract.",
      "“It’s not in my hands, but obviously, one day I would like to win the Ballon d’Or for my people,” he said in May. “When you come from a village in Egypt, as a child, it’s difficult to dream of the Ballon d’Or. It was when I came to Liverpool that I started to think that, maybe, one day…”",
      "Salah went on to point out that “several winners in recent years have been in their 30s” so his candidacy remains strong, as “next season promises to be exciting with the defence of our title with Liverpool and the Champions League, the Africa Cup of Nations with Egypt and the World Cup.”",

      "“Marmoush went to €82m to Man City, when he was 22 – just like Ekitike is now – he was playing in the second division in Germany.",
      "“Now, Ekitike has great numbers with Frankfurt in almost every competition.",
      "“It’s a high fee, but it’s not completely unreasonable, especially when you look at the potential – especially with what’s available.",
      "“If you ask me, he’s the biggest prize after Isak on the market this year, I see him as better than [Benjamin] Sesko, some people have question marks over [Viktor] Gyokeres, so I can see why Frankfurt ask for a fee of €100m.”",
      "Manchester United have been informed that they can sign Liverpool and Chelsea target Hugo Ekitike in a ‘flexible deal’ as they look to reduce his fee.",
      "Man Utd have ‘closely followed’ Hugo Ekitike since his Reims days and are now ‘making concrete progress’ to sign him from Frankfurt, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have made their ‘first move’ for Frankfurt striker Hugo Ekitike, with Liverpool also ‘attentive’ to the situation, according to reports.",
      "Liverpool have finalised their four-man striker shortlist for the summer as they get ready to bring in a top-class goalscorer, according to reports.",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",

      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
