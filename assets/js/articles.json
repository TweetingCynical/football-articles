      "Only a whopping £60million would reportedly be enough to see Alejandro Garnacho depart Manchester United. That same transfer fee is also being bandied about as the figure that could clinch the signing of Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "The 20-year-old Argentine has endured a difficult season. Man United sit 16th in the Premier League and are coming off a Europa League final defeat by Tottenham.",
      "Given that Garnacho was subject to bids from Chelsea and Napoli in the January transfer window, his future certainly doesn't seem settled, and his comments after Wednesday's final only added fuel to the fire.",
      "After coming on with just 20 minutes to go in Bilbao, the disgruntled winger not only questioned Ruben Amorim's decision to bench him in favour of Mason Mount but admitted he's not sure where his future lies beyond this season. \"Up until the final, I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision], but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "The Argentine's brother, Roberto Garnacho, took to Instagram to display his anger at the forward's minimal contribution in the final, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\".",
      "\"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus,\" wrote the United star's sibling.",
      "In the aftermath of the game, The Telegraph reported that the Premier League club may accept a bid of £60m for Garnacho, which could open the path for Amorim to reunite with Gyokeres for the same figure despite his release clause reported to be £83.6m.",
      "Leading Sporting CP to a second straight league title, the Sweden international has scored a whopping 53 goals in all competitions this season, making it 96 goals in just 101 games in his two seasons in Portugal.",
      "The 26-year-old has also been routinely linked with a transfer to Arsenal or Juventus, but despite the intense speculation surrounding his next move, his uncle says he could stay put in Portugal.",
      "Asked by Record whether the striker could continue his story in Lisbon, Chris Gyokeres said of his nephew: \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay. Yes, we think so. We hope so, because look… we love it, it's incredible, the country, the people and Sporting. And the Lions. We love it!\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres insists there are \"no hard feelings\" towards Ruben Amorim following his surprising mid-season exit from Sporting CP to Manchester United. Gyokeres has been sensational for the Portuguese side, scoring 53 goals and providing 13 assists in all competitions, including 39 strikes in the league alone.",
      "The Swede played a vital role in helping Sporting secure back-to-back league titles as he scooped the top scorer award for the second successive season. United are said to be vying for the striker's services, but they face tough competition, as reports suggest Arsenal are currently leading the chase for his signature.",
      "The bond between Gyokeres and his ex-boss Amorim may well influence the striker's decision, however, potentially luring him away from other clubs and towards a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "In an interview with SIC, the 26-year-old revealed his team's disappointment following Amorim's sudden exit but insisted there were no grudges regarding his decision to swap Jose Alvalade for Old Trafford.",
      "Gyokeres said: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Before Amorim's departure, Sporting had embarked on an unbeaten streak domestically, claiming victory in each league match before he left in November.",
      "Reflecting upon the winning mentality set by the Portuguese manager, Gyokeres admitted he felt invincible under Amorim. \"I think when you're in that kind of moment where you keep winning, you go in with the same mentality as every game and you keep doing the same things and with the same rhythm,\" he added.",
      "\"That's what we felt when we went into the games. It's possible to have those kinds of moments, I don't know if we would have kept the same level throughout the season, because I think it's very normal in football for there to be stages of the season when you maybe win every game and then there's a period when it's tougher.",
      "\"Of course, we always have the mentality of wanting to win every game, but as we've seen in football, it doesn't always end that way. I think it's very difficult to go through an entire season without losing a single game, as you can see in history, I don't think many teams have done it. It's one thing to win a lot of games and another thing to go a whole season without losing a game.\"",
      "If United were to pursue Gyokeres this summer, the transfer fee would not be too expensive. A gentleman's agreement in the Swede's contract would allow him to leave for a fee of between £55million and £60m, significantly less than his £84.3m release clause.",
      "However, United's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final may jeopardise Amorim's plans to reunite with his former forward.",
      "The 1-0 loss to Spurs means that the Red Devils will not participate in European football in the 2025/26 season, making other clubs more attractive.",
      "Meanwhile, Gyokeres has been non-committal about his plans for the summer. The sought-after striker is expected to leave for the Premier League but hasn't completely ruled out staying put.",
      "\"Hopefully, you can expect that I will keep improving and score goals,\" he said. \"In Portugal? Let's see, it's the future, and it's football as well, so you never know what's going to happen. As you've seen this season, you never know what's going to happen, and it's the same now. We will see in the future.\"",

      "Less than a year after being released by Manchester United, Brandon Williams has been sentenced to 14 months in prison, suspended for two years. And after recently saying it hurt him to watch football, the full back who had been tipped for the very top finds his career in tatters.",
      "Williams, 24, pleaded guilty to driving dangerously, with a balloon in his mouth, and hitting a top speed of 99mph before crashing his Audi A3 into a Ford Fiesta on the A34 near Handforth, Cheshire in August 2023.",
      "And on Friday he was handed a suspended 14-month prison sentence, 180 hours of community service and banned from driving for 30 months. This was not Williams’ first driving offence – he had already accumulated 30 points on his licence – but the damage caused remains untold.",
      "And although he avoided prison, there remains serious doubts over whether a player once so highly rated, has a future in the game - having not played a game for 12 months.",
      "Rare is the player who can return from such a long spell out of the game to hit the heights of before. And it is hard to predict whether clubs will eventually be willing to take a punt on someone with undoubted talent but too many red marks to his name.",
      "Williams joined United’s academy aged eight and made his first-team breakthrough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer while still a teenager in a Europa League draw away to AZ Alkmaar.",
      "And after an otherwise forgettable scoreless encounter Solskjaer was more than enthused by the left back’s bow. “You won’t see a better full debut from a full back anywhere,” Solskjaer said. “The boy is just going to improve and improve. He’s got the right mentality.”",
      "Plenty more opportunities followed with Williams finishing the 2019-20 season by making 36 appearances across all competitions. “He's been fantastic the few games he's played,” Solskjaer said later in that debut campaign. “The boy has no fear, he is as brave as a lion and he got us the win.”",
      "But as Williams recently said on the More Than A Match podcast, he found life “went from 0-100 real quick and that’s what people will never understand.”",
      "The pandemic affected him. While his team-mates were living in their gated mansions, he found life difficult living in a bedroom at his mum’s house. But the lockdown summer brought a four-year deal worth more than £50,000 per and external expectations were that he would kick on.",
      "There would be no regular starting spot during 2020-21 and he was sent on loan to Norwich City the following year.",
      "At Carrow Road, Williams featured semi-regularly as they were relegated to the Championship - and briefly landed himself in hot water because of an Instagram post apparently directed at Canaries fans who he claimed followed him home after a defeat to West Ham.",
      "He returned to Old Trafford in the summer of 2022 but could not find a way into new head coach Erik ten Hag’s plans and found the attention from those in his outer circle was proving a distraction.",
      "With game time limited, the window for off-field distractions grew bigger. “It was difficult,” he added to More Than A Match. “You had family members you didn’t know was (sic) your family, friends you didn’t know was your mates.”",
      "Another loan, to Ipswich Town at the start of last season, brought a clean slate and the initial signs were promising. Except the Cheshire crash came a few days before. “At that point, I was in a bad situation, stuff was going on,” Williams said on the same podcast. He required hospital treatment before he was arrested and breathalysed but tests for drugs and alcohol were negative.",
      "Recorder Eric Lamb acknowledged that Williams had 'strong personal mitigation' after committing the offence at a time of depression.",
      "Still, prosecutors said that Williams - who had previously received driving bans of six months in October 2023 and 12 months in May 2024 - it was fortunate no one was killed from his “erratic driving.”",
      "Andrew Madden, senior Crown Prosecution Service prosecutor, said Williams' driving \"clearly fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver.” Mr Madden added: \"Witnesses said Williams kept speeding up and then braking sharply. It was clear he wasn't in control of the vehicle. The driving was erratic and the speed was grossly excessive. Eventually, Williams lost control completely and crashed.\"",
      "Now the career of a player that Manchester United had the highest hopes for is under serious doubt.",
      "Williams himself has suggested that continuing his playing career away from the glaring lights of the Premier League may be his best option. He said: \"I've had loads of teams trying to get me out - America, Europe and England - but I haven't been ready. I want to go somewhere 100% focused and kick on.",
      "\"I would like to experience that different culture. I'm only 24 so I could do three or four years abroad. Definitely Europe at a good club or an upcoming club.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim was called out by one of his Sporting CP players after deciding to leave the club and take the Manchester United job in the middle of the season.",
      "Amorim made the bold decision to quit Sporting in early November while they were still top of the Portuguese league. Fresh off the back of winning Liga Portugal in 2023/24 and in the midst of another title charge, the 40-year-old accepted the vacant Red Devils job after Erik ten Hag’s sacking.",
      "His exit created instability in the dressing room as Sporting suffered from a string of poor results that derailed their European ambitions and threatened to jeopardise their title charge. But they managed to recover to claim their third Liga Portugal crown in five years last weekend.",
      "Now, Sporting midfielder Morten Hjulmand has lifted the lid on a brutally honest conversation he had with his former boss after the move was made public. The 25-year-old recently recalled how he openly expressed his bitter disappointment in front of his team-mates and Amorim, though it didn’t sway the manager’s decision.",
      "Hjulmand told A Bola: \"We thought that Amorim would stay for the season and fight to also be a two-time champion. Many players wanted to stay at Sporting with Ruben Amorim, because he is a great coach.”",
      "When asked whether he felt betrayed, the Denmark international replied: “That’s a very strong word. We feel disappointed with his departure. We were on a run of 11 consecutive wins, doing very well in the Champions League.",
      "“Everything was very clear to everyone on the pitch. It was almost as if we were playing Playstation. Everyone knew what they had to do.",
      "“I told him in front of the other players that we were disappointed with his departure. We were counting on him to help us all fight for the second title.",
      "“He himself said the same thing at the start of the season. But afterwards, I also told Ruben that we understood his decision.”",
      "Amorim revealed after his United move was announced that he had originally planned to leave Sporting at the end of the current 2024/25 season. Yet, he was informed that the offer from United wouldn't still be available come May.",
      "Speaking at the time of the United announcement, the Portuguese said: “We started very well this season and then Manchester United came in for me. They paid above the amount set for my release clause and the president of Sporting CP defended the club's interests.",
      "“I never argued about anything with the president regarding the negotiations. The only thing I asked during the process was that it take place at the end of the season.",
      "“I spent three days asking for this, but I was told it wasn’t possible. It was now or never, otherwise they would look for another option. I had three days to decide something that radically changes my life.”",
      "Amorim added: “I have to take steps forward in my career and it was harder for me than any other Sportinguista to leave. I knew that if I rejected Manchester United, in seven months' time I wouldn’t have that option available, and I knew that at the end of the season I was going to leave Sporting CP.",
      "“I could have felt a sense of regret that would be difficult to deal with. Between the disappointment of all Sportinguistas and taking risks in my career, or waiting for the end of the season and not having the only club that I wanted to join as an option, I had to decide. So I decided.”",
      "It’s unclear whether Amorim regrets that decision almost seven months on, having experienced an agonising first season at Old Trafford. During his tenure, United have consistently set new records for lows as the head coach struggles to impart his philosophy at the already-ailing club.",
      "With United ending the campaign just above the relegation zone and fresh off a disastrous Europa League final loss which ruled out European football next season, Amorim has made it clear that he is open to leaving this summer if club bosses and fans decide he is the wrong man for the job.",

The Crown Prosecution Service said the footballer was spotted driving at high speeds and in an erratic manner in an Audi A3 on the A34 near Handforth, Cheshire, on August 20 2023.",
      "The full-back had a female passenger in his car, and was spotted by witnesses well over the speed limit and with a balloon at his mouth. On March 14, he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without third party insurance at Chester Crown Court and said \"no comment\" when asked about witnesses seeing the balloon, according to the CPS.",
      "During the hearing, Williams was told by recorder Eric Lamb that there was ‘strong personal mitigation’. Reference was made to the footballer committing the offence when suffering with depression.",
      "The car in which Williams was travelling collided with a blue Ford Fiesta at around 6.17pm before crashing into the central reservation. He was breathalysed following the incident, but the test came up negative.",

      "\"But the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything. We have to see. We have to see. I know everything that you did [say], I said before you. In this moment, I’m not going to be here defending myself. It’s not my style.",
      "\"In this moment it’s a little bit of faith, so let’s see. If the board and the fans feel I’m not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation, but I will not quite.",
      "\"Again, I’m really confident about my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things. I think I was always really honest with you guys. We didn’t perform perfect today, but we were better than the opponent, and the opponent also played.\""

      "Embattled boss Ruben Amorim had been hoping to be able to bring in a number of players to finally make his system work. But with no European football to attract players and a depleted transfer warchest, bringing in top players will be highly difficult.",

      "But their is now increasing doubts that Fernandes will see out the rest of that deal. Saudi Pro League side Hilal are pushing to sign the midfielder and are ready to tap into their country's huge wealth reserves.",
      "According to The Athletic FC podcast, the offer from Hilal is a 'genuine' one. It is claimed the Saudi side are ready to offer around £80m for Fernandes, who turns 31 in September.",
      "That opens ahead of the Club World Cup, running from 1 June to 10 June. Fernandes is understood to be on the list of players Hilal are looking to target heading into this summer's tournament.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon for £68m back in January 2020. Fernandes would have the chance to link up with compatriots João Cancelo and Ruben Neves if he did join Hilal.",

      "Big calls have been made with Manchester United placing every player on the transfer list after their Europa League final heartbreak. Ruben Amorim failed to salvage his miserable first season in charge as defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao ensured there would be no European football for the Red Devils next season.",
      "And now the autopsy begins with Amorim ready to rip up his underperforming squad, with some unpopular decisions set to be made. That includes potentially cashing in on some of the club's academy graduates, with one perhaps at the front of the queue.",
      "While the defeat to Spurs added a final stamp of misery on their season, Amorim faced further annoyance minutes after the final whistle after Alejandro Garnacho's address to the assembled media in the San Mames Stadium.",
      "The United youth product's comments after the defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao is enough to be shown the door quickly by the United hierarchy after making a thinly-veiled dig to his boss so soon after the defeat.",
      "\"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know,\" said Garnacho. \"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "To make things worse, his brother, Roberto, added fuel to the fire by describing how Alejandro was \"thrown under the bus\" by the former Sporting coach upon learning he will be on the bench. Now, Amorim has to respond harshly and take a leaf out of Sir Alex Ferguson's book and show Garnacho the door rather than make it look like the Spanish-born Argentine has full control of the situation.",
      "Sir Alex never stuttered when it came to those who dared question him or fall out with him during his tenure as United boss. Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Roy Keane were all stalwarts during their careers at Old Trafford but one wrong step in the manager's eyes and you were gone without a second thought.",
      "It is not like it was an off-the-cuff comment either from the Madrid-born player. Just hours before the final even started, Garnacho posted pictures on his Instagram page celebrating after scoring the opening goal in the FA Cup final last season - which United went on to win against arch-rivals Manchester City. This is not a player who is just assessing his options. This is a player who is clearly controlling the narrative and the sooner that is shut down the better for Amorim if he is to maintain harmony in the dressing room as the season closes.",
      "Garnacho has crossed the line and now he has to face the consequences of this after questioning Amorim in the press. It will be the 40-year-old's first major test going into the summer transfer window as he looks to make a significant impact in the summer for the Red Devils.",
      "He has made the right move with the \"back me or sack me\" ultimatum (or bluff depending on how you have interpreted it) to the board but now he really needs to make an impact on the dressing room. It is not like the board will be reluctant either. He has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford in the previous transfer window - with Chelsea (currently at 4/1 to sign the Argentina international) previously rumoured to acquire his services with their ever-growing list of wingers - with the decision-makers at the club willing to listen in the past.",
      "No doubt Sir Jim Ratcliffe is licking his lips at the prospect of a big PSR win when selling the 20-year-old as the minority shareholder seeks a financial boost.",
      "It is a win-win situation for the Portuguese coach as he looks to really make his mark at United with the season set to end. Having previously stated he wanted to join United this summer instead of November last year, the former Benfica midfielder has endured six torrid months with the resources at his disposal with a squad who endured their worst ever Premier League campaign and worst league campaign in almost 50 years",

      "The former Atalanta star has thrived under Ruben Amorim this season even as others have struggled. He earned minutes under Amorim's predecessor Erik ten Hag, scoring some important goals last term, but really came into his own under the Portuguese and scored his first United hat-trick against Southampton in January.",
      "Amad also signed a contract extension in January, with the new deal keeping him at Old Trafford in January. While others may well leave this summer, his comments suggest he's determined to put things right at his current club rather than moving on.",
      "\"First of all, I would like to congratulate Tottenham on their victory, and then apologize to all Manchester fans around the world,\" he wrote on social media. \"It's been an unacceptable season, and no one can deny that, but we always put our motivation on the pitch.",
      "\"I promise you that a season like this will never happen again at this great club. Thank you all for your support throughout the season; you've been by our side no matter what.\"",
      "United were without Amad for much of the second half of the season, a period where their league results suffered. An ankle injury kept him out of 10 straight league games, with the club's only victories during the run coming against bottom-three sides Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "The 22-year-old also missed European victories over Real Sociedad and Lyon, but returned to play a part in the semi-final triumph over Athletic Club. Ruben Amorim backed him to start in the final against Spurs, but few of United's players were able to assert themselves in a disappointing 1-0 reverse.",
      "Speaking to the media after the defeat, United boss Amorim shed some more light on what the club will be able to do in the transfer market. “We have two plans, even for the market and we need to understand it’s tough for a club like ours not to be in the Champions League,\" he said.",
      "\"But we have to use the other side. If we have more time, we have more time to think, to work during the week and to be better in the Premier League. That will be our focus.”",
      "United have one final Premier League game ahead of them, with Aston Villa visiting Old Trafford on Sunday. Unai Emery's side need three points to give themselves a chance of qualifying for the Champions League, but unlike United they are at least guaranteed some form of European football next term."

      "\"They've actually got so much worse under him. It might have been papering over the cracks if they had won the Europa League, but their problems were summed up in that 97 minutes: no creativity, no legs, no energy, no goals, and a complete mess.\"",
      "Shearer believes that it will be incredibly difficult for United to turn their fortunes around quickly. He made an early predicition that next season will be another campaign without any silverware for the Red Devils.",
      "\"It's a mess at Manchester United. Much like Spurs, their season was this competition. We've been seeing it for the last two or three months that both clubs needed to win this competition to salvage something from their season,\" Shearer added.",
      "\"Financially, it will hurt them to attract the players they wanted because they're not Man United from 20 years ago, where most players wanted to go there. They're not that football club anymore; they're only that club by name.",
      "\"They don't deserve to win the Europa League or be in the Champions League. They've been awful all season in every department. The final basically just summed up their season as a whole: slow, terrible in front of the goal, no threat, no energy, and really poor.",
      "\"Are they going to be in the market for top players now? Top players want to play in the Champions League and challenge for trophies. Are Man United going to be challenging for trophies next season? I think the simple answer is no, they're not.\""

      "Manchester United are at rock bottom following their miserable defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final. For the pessimists there is more misery on the horizon, but for the optimists it means the only way is up.",
      "A lot will depend on what happens this summer, with an absolutely crucial transfer window on the horizon. United know they need to make wholesale changes – and that’s why Sir Jim Ratcliffe has taken the unprecedented step of placing the entire squad at risk of being sold.",
      "Nobody is above the axe of Ratcliffe, who has already made hundreds of United staff redundant and has made it very clear that he’s not motivated by winning popularity contests. The sign has been put into the front lawn: United are clearing out their garage and everyone has a price. Let the bidding commence.",
      "United paid Inter Milan £43million for Onana. He’s coming up to two years as United’s number one and it’s clear that it just hasn’t worked out. His fated ability to play out from the back hasn’t had any tangible benefit and, instead, we’ve been treated to the occasional howler. Yet he is still one of the players who has some sell-on value, so make the most of it. SELL.",
      "Hard to judge the Turkish keeper, who has only played 10 times for United in two seasons. When he has played, like in the 4-1 defeat by Newcastle in April, he didn’t cover himself in glory, making a dreadful error. But, to be brutally honest, United have bigger fish to fry than their second-choice goalkeeper. KEEP.",
      "Look up ‘good man to have around the dressing room’ in the football cliche dictionary and it is likely that Heaton will be cited. But at 39 years old, and with his contract about to expire, the time has come to hang up your boots, Tom. RELEASE.",
      "The Swede has been at United since 2017 and if we’re being brutally honest – which we are – he has never really been good enough to be a mainstay at such a club. With his contract up on June 30, his final act as a United player will be getting a yellow card for shouting at the fourth official in Bilbao. RELEASE.",
      "One of the summer arrivals in Erik ten Hag’s ill-fated final transfer window. A solid if unspectacular defender, who does have the benefit of being able to play in a few positions. Does he have the legs to play as a wingback in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 formation? I’m not convinced, but we can’t flog everyone. KEEP.",
      "Has had an injury-hit debut campaign with United and looks a long way off the much-hyped Ajax youngster of his heyday. He cost United £42.9m from Bayern Munich in the summer and is a classic example of their poor recruitment. SELL.",
      "I love Maguire. But watching him flail around in the Spurs penalty area, desperately trying to affect the game, while fighting with Cristian Romero, looked a lot like the death knell of a football team. Amorim essentially put the big lad up top and hoped. It is time to move on from Maguire. SELL.",
      "It feels like a long, long time since we were debating whether a 5ft 9in centre-back could hack it in the Greatest League In the World™. The diminutive defender has been out injured for some time, which has the effect of increasing his stock during miserable times like these. KEEP.",
      "Coming to a quiz near you as a pointless answer in about 10 years. SELL.",
      "Signed in January, Dorgu has at times looked like the sort of left wing-back Amorim requires. He has the athleticism to get up and down the wing, a solid left foot and appears to have a pretty high ceiling. KEEP.",
      "United beat Real Madrid to the signing of Yoro, but have been dismayed to see him injured for much of this season. Still only 19 years old, the Frenchman needs to stay injury-free and have some stability around him. KEEP.",
      "Injuries have taken their toll on Shaw, who is United’s longest-serving current player having joined the club way back in 2014. It is crazy that he still has two years left on his deal. Ratcliffe is not afraid of taking tough decisions and getting rid of the England defender is one that needs doing. SELL.",
      "Has been one of the strong performers over the past few seasons and appears to be a good fit for Amorim’s tactical system. Dalot also seems like a leader in the dressing room – and considering I’m getting rid of a lot of them – he is worth keeping. KEEP.",
      "One of few bright lights in a dark, dark season. Heaven was pinched from Arsenal and showed plenty of promise when he played. KEEP.",
      "A veteran player who has been a model professional for United. But he’s 37 years old and out of contract next month. RELEASE.",
      "The young defender has broken into the first team this season and is one of a few players who is flying the flag for the famous United academy. KEEP.",
      "Pre-season will be indicative for Fredricson, who like Amass has got a taste of first-team football. Amorim will know whether he has a shot, but a loan spell might be more appropriate. KEEP.",
      "Judged by numbers only, Mount has been a dreadful buy for £55m. He has four goals and one assist in 45 appearances for United. But, now he’s fit again, he needs to kick on and prove himself as a No.10 in Amorim’s shape. There is absolutely no chance United can sell him, so they better hope he turns up next season. KEEP.",
      "Right then. United’s best player and captain. The source of 19 goals and 19 assists this season. But also a player who has concrete interest from the Saudi Pro League. I would take the gamble and sell up. United need to change their culture and – rightly or wrongly – Fernandes has become the embodiment of their malaise. He will fetch a good price and, considering he turns 31 in September, it could prove smart business in hindsight. The only problem is replacing him without the allure of European football… SELL.",
      "A very very simple decision. Hasn’t been good enough for about two years. A player well past his peak. Thankfully, his contract is up. RELEASE.",
      "The man referenced by Ratcliffe as embodying the wasteful recruitment model of the United of old. The former Real Madrid man is past his best and the image of him running through quicksand, trying to catch up to Spurs players on the break, will stick with me. Off he goes to Saudi Arabia. SELL.",
      "United went through an awful lot of faff to sign Ugarte from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer and didn’t get much for their £50m. However, the Uruguay international cannot be written off yet. He has the right profile to replace Casemiro and should be given the chance to step up. KEEP.",
      "Like everyone else in the squad, Mainoo is up for sale, but really he shouldn’t be. He is a talented young Mancunian who represents a link to the club’s fans. He is a supremely gifted youngster with the ability to develop into a great box-to-box midfielder. He just needs to be managed well and not burdened. KEEP.",
      "I’m not sure that Collyer has the ability to make a mark on United next season. SELL.",
      "The fact he was loaned out to Rotherham in January says a lot. SELL.",
      "I feel sorry for Hojlund. He clearly isn’t a £72m player. He should not be burdened with the goalscoring demands that come with being United’s first-choice No.9. The Dane is too inexperienced for the role he’s inherited. He should either be an understudy to an experienced striker, or sold to sign such a player. Reports in Italy suggest United could flog him back to where he came from. If that doesn’t happen then he can take up the role he should’ve had in the first place. KEEP.",
      "There is no going back from December when Amorim froze him out. He wants a new challenge and should be given it, with his spell on loan at Aston Villa doing his sale value no harm. SELL.",
      "United’s interest in Matheus Cunha is not good news for Zirkee, who is at his best dropping off the back line into space. The difference is Cunha is more talented and has scored a lot more goals this season for Wolves. Zirkzee may still have admirers abroad. United should call them up. SELL.",
      "One of few success stories from a terrible spell of recruitment. The young winger is a joy to watch and, if he hadn’t been injured this season, could have led United to a few more wins (just remember how good that last-minute Manchester Derby winner was). KEEP.",
      "Garnacho strongly hinted at a summer departure in the wake of the defeat by Spurs. He has been linked with Chelsea and Napoli and, to be frank, United should cash in because his end product is severely lacking. He has six goals and two assists in 36 Premier League appearances. Get rid. SELL.",
      "The Brazilian has turned into a different player since joining Real Betis on loan, but it would be foolish to think he would simply bring that form to Old Trafford if United recalled him. It would be much wiser to cut your losses on the £82m Ten Hag flop. SELL.",
      "Wayne Rooney said he felt sorry for Obi when watching him play against Brentford recently, with United showing no idea of how to utilise the youngster. The hope is that, with better team-mates, he can come good. KEEP.",
      "Another tale of waste at United. Sancho cost £73m from Borussia Dortmund but never got close to repaying that fee. He hasn’t done an awful lot on loan at Chelsea, but luckily they have an obligation to buy the winger. SELL."

      "Tottenham’s Europa League heroes are said to not be expecting Ange Postecoglou to remain as boss next season. The Australian, who has been under intense pressure this season, stuck one to his critics on Wednesday night by ending the club’s long trophy drought.",
      "A 1-0 win over Manchester United in Bilbao meant Spurs lifted the Europa League - their first piece of silverware in 17 years - as well as securing a place in next season’s Champions League.",
      "The result helped to salvage a season which has seen Spurs endure their worst domestic season in almost 50 years. Going into the final game of the Premier League season, the North Londoners are 17th in the table, having slumped to a staggering 21 league defeats.",
      "It now remains to be seen whether their European exploits will be enough to convince Daniel Levy that Postecoglou deserves a third season in the Spurs dugout. But the Daily Mail reports that Tottenham ’s players do not expect that to happen, with a change now deemed more likely.",
      "The report adds that alternatives to Postecoglou are already being discussed by Levy, with Fulham boss Marco Silva one of the names in the frame this summer. Brennan Johnson, who was credited with the winning goal over United, suggested that winning the trophy would be the perfect ‘mic drop’ for the manager.",
      "Captain Son Heung-min made it clear that he wants the 59-year-old to stay with the club. He said: “He won the trophy. Nobody else did it, so - look, it’s not up to me or the players, but we just have to look at the facts.",
      "“At the fact that we hadn’t won in 17 years, but this is the day we finally won it. It’s the manager who wins the trophy. So we'll see what’s going to happen.”",
      "Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario echoed Son's impassioned plea for Postecoglou to stay and said: “Yeah, of course. He’s my gaffer. He’s the person who decided to bring me to this club. I just have to be very thankful to him for how much he believed since day one, since he wanted me to sign for the club.",
      "“I’m very happy for him, for what we achieved together. It’s a brilliant night, he deserves this a lot.”",
      "Postecoglou himself was less definitive, despite making it clear that he hopes to remain as Spurs boss. \"I've had such a laser focus on winning this, whatever happens, happens,” he said when asked about his future.",
      "\"I'm the manager of the football club, that decision is not in my hands. All I know is having this [medal] around my neck means we have won a trophy. I don't feel I have completed the job.",
      "\"We're still building this team. It's a young team, we need to add experience and now we are in the Champions League. I've been trying to build a team that can be challenging for the next four or five years.",

      "Manchester United legend Norman Whiteside has decided not to renew his season ticket at Old Trafford due to a series of issues, including the relocation of his seat, leading his wife to declare \"enough is enough\".",
      "Whiteside, who joined United as a teenager in 1978 and made his way into the first team, scored 67 goals in 274 appearances for the Red Devils before moving to Everton in 1989. The decision by Whiteside and his wife, Dee, to not renew their season tickets comes a year after they were forced to move their seats at Old Trafford to accommodate executive seating.",
      "In a post on X, Dee Whiteside expressed her disappointment: \"So, I've waited for a while to write this. It is with unbelievable sadness, that after more than 28 years of having season tickets at Old Trafford, @NormanWhiteside and I are not renewing next year.",
      "\"And to cap it all, we've seen it all, we've won the lot, we're Man United and we're never gonna stop... except for so many seasons now, my match-going loyalty to my club has ended so sadly.",
      "\"I'll still be at games, I'm MUFC until I die, and I've seen worse times than now, but I'm not sure I've seen players less interested in pulling on our shirt for very many years. Times must change.\"",
      "Whiteside and his wife, are platinum season ticket holders at Old Trafford, by virtue of having the seats for more than 25 years, but will now walk away. United's decision to move season ticket holders from block S122 at Old Trafford was reported by the MEN last year, a change that impacted the Whitesides.",
      "A spokesperson for United acknowledged: \"We have the greatest respect for Norman as a legend of the club, and understand the disappointment caused to him and other season ticket-holders by seat relocations.",
      "\"There are various reasons why this happens, including, next season, the moving of matchday hospitality seats into consolidated blocks to address fan concerns about them being dispersed around the stadium.",
      "\"Other changes next season include the removal of hospitality seating from the Stretford End and installation of further rail seating in the North-West Quadrant, bringing benefits to many fans but also causing some disruption.",
      "\"No additional hospitality seats are being created at the expense of season ticket-holders - in fact hospitality seating will reduce by more than 500 next season. We are committed to working with all season ticket-holders affected by relocations, including Norman, to find them the best possible alternative seats elsewhere in the ground.\"",
      "During his tenure in Manchester, Whiteside set records as the youngest player to score in both FA Cup and League Cup finals. The Northern Irishman also surpassed Pele's record to become the youngest player to participate in a World Cup, representing his country at the tender age of 17 years and 40 days.",
      "Injury forced Whiteside to retire at just 26, but he remains a beloved figure among fans for his contributions, particularly his match-winning goal against Everton in the 1985 FA Cup final."

      "Bruno Fernandes has been offered an exit route from Manchester United after their defeat in the Europa League final. United are braced for sweeping changes in the summer transfer window after missing out on Champions League football next season by losing to Tottenham – and their captain could be among those leaving.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe is ready to take a brutal stance this summer in order to furnish Ruben Amorim with a fresh squad for the 2025/26 season. United want to bring in Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and Ipswich striker Liam Delap, but only have around £100million to spend before taking into account sales.",
      "Fernandes is under contract with United until June 2027, while the club also have the option of a further year. But the 30-year-old admitted in the aftermath of defeat in Bilbao that he would understand if United sold him – and that has now become a real possibility.",
      "That approach was rejected by his representatives, but Al-Hilal have not given up and Fernandes’ honest comments to the media in northern Spain will have given them hope a deal can be reached.",
      "“If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this,” he said.",
      "“I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.”",
      "Fernandes joined United in January 2020 from Sporting Lisbon for £68million and has been a key player ever since. He has contributed 98 goals and 86 assists in 289 appearances for the club and has been captain since Erik ten Hag replaced Harry Maguire two summers ago.",
      "He has been United’s stand-out performer this season with 19 goals and 19 assists in 56 appearances. But with United 16th in the Premier League and facing a year without any European football, Ratcliffe is ready to oversee a brutal fire sale this summer.",
      "While loanees Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are the primary targets for sales, there is a feeling that the club will have to offload some key players too. Amorim has described Fernandes as one of the best players in the world and dismissed previous rumours around him, but the decision could be taken out of his hands this summer."

      "If only Victor Thorp had cut his toenails that April Sunday morning. If Thorp was onside in the 120th minute at Wembley, he would have consigned Manchester United to one of their most ignominious defeats to second-tier Coventry City. It would have been sacked in the evening, rather than the morning for Erik ten Hag.",
      "United's season would have ended trophyless. Instead, it ended gloriously, and the game is about glory. No United fan at Wembley in May last year will forget their day in the sun.",
      "But the club's 13th FA Cup triumph was detrimental in the long run. Sir Jim Ratcliffe lost his nerve, kept Ten Hag and United have lost 18 Premier League games already this season. They are assured of a schedule devoid of jaunts across the continent next season.",
      "United's wallets will be hit. There will be a derisory merit payment for what could be a 17th-place finish in the Premier League, no European revenue, no matchday revenue in the Champions League and a penalty clause invoked in the Adidas deal. Roughly, that is an £80million black hole.",
      "They have squandered nearly £15m keeping Erik ten Hag and then hiring and firing Dan Ashworth. There is also the £200m they largely misspent on players in Ten Hag's last transfer window.",
      "2019 was the year of the 'cultural reset' at United. Reset, revamp or reboot, none of those words do United's current position justice. Without relegation (never a tangible threat), they are at rock bottom.",
      "They have to frame next season positively. Free midweeks for Ruben Amorim to coach the players to within an inch of their lives, ample rest between matches and the motivation to ensure United do not end up anywhere near to where they are now.",
      "Here is a five-point plan to make United a force again:",
      "More proactivism, less pragmatism",
      "Amorim has agonised over whether to play pragmatically or proactively. In Bilbao, he did neither. Alejandro Garnacho was benched as Mason Mount retained the faith of a coach who \"loves\" him yet overlooked the fact that the playmaker is not as much of a goal threat as Garnacho. And United did not score for the 16th time.",
      "One of the accusations levelled at Mount is he does little with the ball. Amorim bristled at the suggestion he had got it wrong by starting Mount, reminding this correspondent that Garnacho missed a one-on-one in the semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao, a match Mount emerged in to end the Spanish side's chances of a comeback.",
      "Mount's fleeting purple patch consisted of three goals in two games and he did not play 90 minutes in either. Garnacho had started 14 successive games until his 'rest' for the defeat against West Ham. That he remained on the bench at Chelsea five days later was significant.",
      "Had Leny Yoro not recovered from a foot injury, Amorim would have started the same side that lost at Chelsea. United were competitive for around an hour at Stamford Bridge when matches last for 90 minutes. They managed one attempt on target. Garnacho forced Guglielmo Vicario to dive down to his left within minutes of his belated arrival on Wednesday night.",
      "United also had glaring issues in midfield against Spurs: full backs as wingers. Noussair Mazraoui admitted last week he is more settled as a right centre back as it is the closest position to playing at right back. Mazraoui is not an attack-minded winger and United offered no threat down Tottenham's left-hand side when they ought to have doubled up on the shaky Destiny Udogie.",
      "Bruno Fernandes seemed to have been reinvented as a central midfielder before the March internationals. Then he moved forward again when United's season resumed at Nottingham Forest. Suddenly, he was back in midfield for the dress rehearsal at Chelsea. Amorim maybe wanted some finesse in midfield against the conservative trio of Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma and Pape Sarr but Fernandes, United's top scorer, had to be in the front three for the final.",
      "Mazraoui should be considered a centre half from next season and United need an upgrade on the right wing. Amorim played wingers in the 3-4-2-1 system at Sporting yet has settled on full backs at United. The ends have not justified the means yet United have already invested £25million in the Danish left back Patrick Dorgu, who started by default in Bilbao.",
      "Compromise with youngsters",
      "Garnacho is becoming a problem for United. Like Marcus Rashford before him, he has developed an inflated air of entitlement and it should startle United that a 20-year-old brazenly sounded off about a \"s**t\" season, criticised the manager's decision to drop him and cast doubt on his future. His gobby brother had also joined in online.",
      "The authority of the United manager's role should always be protected but Garnacho is a nuanced case. There has been a willingness from the player and coach to make it work since he was dropped from the Manchester derby squad on December 15 and Amorim has enthused about the adjustments Garnacho has made to his game.",
      "Garnacho remains one of a handful of fan favourites. He was serenaded when he warmed up at San Mames and there was a bullish roar when he was ordered back to come on. He was seen as such an ally of Amorim's he flanked him for the pre-match press conference for the semi-final second leg against Athletic.",
      "United are renowned for wingers and Garnacho is one of the academy's biggest success stories this century. Only Garnacho jars with Amorim's system and a new number 10, Matheus Cunha, is expected to occupy one of those two roles behind the striker.",
      "There has been interest in Garnacho and there is an obvious temptation for United to cash in. He would represent pure profit, you can't tolerate any player publicly questioning the manager and he does not naturally fit into the system.",
      "Napoli, on the verge of a fourth Scudetto, wanted Garnacho in January and deemed him worthy of replacing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia. Antonio Conte, the Napoli coach, oversaw one of Eden Hazard's greatest seasons at Chelsea. Those are ringing endorsements United should be wary of.",
      "All parties need to sit around a table, thrash out their differences and seek a compromise. That also applies to Kobbie Mainoo, the poster boy of United's future as recently as the start of this season but no longer a regular. Amorim has misgivings about Mainoo as a midfielder and has trialled him as a playmaker and a striker with mixed results.",
      "It would be beyond bold for United to cash in on Mainoo and/or Garnacho when it is not a stretch to imagine them requiring a new manager in the autumn. United can improve with Amorim, Garnacho and Mainoo all on the bus, despite Garnacho's brother claiming he was thrown under it.",
      "Recruit for the club, not the manager",
      "If United fans were given the choice between Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres the majority would opt for the latter. Gyokeres is older and more proven, albeit in a much weaker league, and United know all-too-well the pitfalls of stockpiling players schooled outside one of Europe's top five leagues.",
      "Gyokeres would be a legitimate exception, yet United have settled on Delap. The dynamic suddenly shifts as the scrutiny would be on Jason Wilcox, rather than Amorim. Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed Wilcox possesses \"the best eyes in football\" and he has not looked far for United's next starting striker, having watched Delap develop at City when he was the head of their academy.",
      "United's recruitment will be severely impacted by the absence of European football from their schedule next season. Cunha and Delap are attainable through release clauses. That feels like a cop-out with Delap, only four days younger than the dismal Rasmus Hojlund. They have a -12 goal difference. They cannot cut corners with the striker's role.",
      "Last year, United operated by a one for the manager, one for the board policy. Ten Hag reunited with Ajax alumni but also integrated two signings from the French league with no links to Dutch football. Leny Yoro should have ushered in a very different recruitment era at United, only their next arrival was the Dutchman Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The mid-season signings of Dorgu and Ayden Heaven have offered a glimpse of what could come this summer and beyond. But the worst United side in 51 years needs proven commodities, particularly if Bruno Fernandes heads for the Riyadh retirement home.",
      "Expendable culture",
      "United are bound to be saddled with some immovable players. Luke Shaw was raw in the San Mames mixed zone, questioning if he is good enough. We all know the answer and he should, too. He is not going to put his own contract through the shredder two years before its expiry date.",
      "Nobody should be off-limits if United receive an acceptable offer. How could they be after a season like this one? That applies to Garnacho and Mainoo. If they want a change of scenery then that is the clincher.",
      "Jose Mourinho was standing in the doorway when he spoke to some of us in San Jose in 2018 and said he would not stand in the way of Anthony Martial, who wanted to leave. But Ed Woodward did. Ratcliffe was still cursing Woodward's methods as recently as March. United have let innumerable players outstay their welcome and Martial was one of them. Shaw is another. Victor Lindelof, too.",
      "The profitability and sustainability rules have influenced the length of contracts but United have got to stop doling out five-year deals like a volunteer with leaflets on Deansgate. Shorter contracts would keep players on their toes. Amorim's deal only has two years left to run and he will be judged much sooner than 2027.",
      "A new fall-guy at hierarchical level",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford sunk his claws into Ratcliffe a while ago and Ratcliffe is quite taken by him. Two years after the Ineos delegation visited Old Trafford, nobody has given a satisfactory explanation for Brailsford's presence on the United football board.",
      "Brailsford has admitted he is \"no expert in football\". You can see that from United's results since he started to have input on their performance. Brailsford was an ally of Ashworth's. United spent longer courting Ashworth than the five months he lasted at United.",
      "Ratcliffe should send Brailsford on his bike. That would show Ineos are serious about arresting United's staggering decline."

      "Before Wednesday's Europa League final, Manchester United would have had a Plan A and a Plan B for this summer. The binmen in Bilbao might find the more expressive shopping list discarded somewhere in the days to come.",
      "United have sought to downplay the impact the loss of that cash will have on their summer transfer plans, and they continue to press ahead with attempts to sign Matheus Cunha and Liam Delap. But for a club that has sacked 400 members of its workforce and made a series of penny-pinching measures, it's pretty obvious the financial effect of defeat to Tottenham will be seismic.",
      "But those two plans should cover departures as well as arrivals, and with no European football next season, Ineos can now take a bludgeon to this squad. United could have 31 first-team squad members when players return for pre-season and in a campaign that could be as short as 40 games, that is wildly excessive.",
      "A 25-man squad for next season would be fine, but only if that included some of the club's promising youngsters who are on the fringes of the first team. Any bigger, and there will be senior players barely getting a kick, and the dynamic at training will be difficult to manage for Ruben Amorim, who is desperate to make the most of those free weeks at Carrington.",
      "Some of the departures are straightforward. Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are out of contract and will leave next month. Tyrell Malacia, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all out on loan and will be sold in the summer. That is seven players going already.",
      "Then are the potential sales. Change looks certain in the goalkeeping department, and Altay Bayindir should be sold for an upgrade to offer more competition to Andre Onana.",
      "The departures of Evans and Lindelof free up space in defence for Ayden Heaven, and no further sales are really required here, although the wing-back situation is one to monitor. Diogo Dalot needs competition on the right, and having Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass on the left looks light, but there might be no other option.",
      "Sales should be considered in midfield. The failure to qualify for the Champions League makes Casemiro's role redundant next season. He is a European specialist who has struggled in the Premier League, and Ineos desperately need shot of the club's highest earner. Manuel Ugarte doesn't look up to the job yet, but will get another season. Toby Collyer turns 22 in January and either needs more games or to be sold as well, as there are a crop of promising midfielders in the academy waiting for their chance.",
      "In attack, selling or at least loaning one of Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund looks essential. Neither are up to the job, but Zirkzee has probably shown more promise. He is less of a natural fit as a No. 9 for Amorim, but his versatility to play behind a striker is beneficial. If Amorim keeps Chido Obi in the first-team picture, he is another option at centre-forward.",
      "Then there are the two most controversial possible departures. Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho would have both been frustrated at their roles in the Europa League final and it's clear Amorim is yet to fully trust either. As academy graduates, they represent pure profit in the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) and are sellable assets.",
      "A departure for either would go down badly amongst supporters, but neither is in Amorim's strongest team, and it would be a major financial boost. Without the guarantee of what would have been at least 10 extra fixtures in the Champions League, keeping both of them happy might be a challenge as well.",
      "That is the context with which United must approach this summer. Defeat in Bilbao means they have to be ruthless when it comes to trimming the size of this squad."

      "The dust is beginning to settle on Manchester United's defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "United's season revolved around winning the Europa League for a few months and they stumbled to a 1-0 defeat at the Estadio de San Mames after a first-half goal from Brennan Johnson.",
      "The defeat means there will be no Champions League football at Old Trafford for a successive season. United have endured their worst campaign for 51 years, and Ruben Amorim has promised to quit without receiving any compensation if the United hierarchy feel he is no longer good enough to be their coach.",
      "However, Amorim is understood to still have the board's backing and he is set to remain in charge for next season, which means he must be supported in the summer transfer window.",
      "There are supporters who have questioned whether Amorim is the right coach to take the club forward, though, especially ahead of what will be a crucial transfer window.",
      "United cannot afford any mistakes in the transfer market this summer, but would persisting with Amorim be a mistake? Here are the arguments for and against sacking Amorim:",
      "Against: Amorim inherited the squad",
      "Can Amorim be judged fairly when he inherited a squad that was assembled by his predecessors? Erik ten Hag spent over £400million during his tenure and left behind practically nothing to show for it.",
      "United spent £108.5m on two strikers who struggle to score goals. Amorim has gone from working with Viktor Gyökeres, one of the most prolific goalscorers in Europe, to coaching Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, who have scored just 17 goals between them in all competitions this term.",
      "For comparison, Gyökeres has netted 53 goals for Sporting Lisbon this season and Amorim was dealt an impossible task when he agreed to take over a side with no natural goalscorer.",
      "The dressing room needs to be gutted. The majority of the players are not good enough to represent the club following an utterly joyless campaign.",
      "Of course, he needs to improve the players he inherited - that is part of his remit - but you can't make a concrete judgement on Amorim when he inherited a mess of a squad.",
      "For: the Premier League campaign",
      "There is no getting away from the disastrous Premier League campaign. United have been shocking and they will record their lowest points total in the Premier League era.",
      "Wherever you look, the league statistics make for grim reading. Amorim has won just 24 points in 26 games, averaging a 0.92 points per game. United last beat a team that wasn't relegated on January 26.",
      "Amorim's points ratio is even lower than Paul Jewell's 0.94-per-game average during Derby County's infamous 2007/08 campaign, when the Rams set the top-flight's lowest ever points total.",
      "Since Amorim's appointment in November, United have been beaten by Nottingham Forest, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Wolves and West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost a record 18 games in the league and have a goal difference of -12.",
      "The team's focus shifted to the Europa League in February, but the lifeless performances in the league haven't been acceptable and Amorim must hit the ground running next season.",
      "Against: an impressive communicator",
      "Amorim has shown himself to be an impressive communicator in press conferences and interviews, which has helped his reputation among fans, who haven't turned against him.",
      "\"We'll back him from the Stretford End,\" has continued to be chanted to the tune of Bonnie Tyler's hit It's a Heartache despite the awful results, and the way Amorim has communicated has helped his cause.",
      "Amorim is convinced he knows what needs to be done to turn the club around and he is articulate when he speaks to journalists. More importantly, the players seem convinced in his plan, as Bruno Fernandes, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot all backed him after the Europa League final.",
      "Speaking in the mixed zone, Shaw said: \"I think there's a lot of things that need to be changed. I think that's why Ruben is 100% the right person.",
      "\"He knows and he can see day in and day out at the club, not just on the pitch but off the pitch, around the club. The standards, the mindset, like I said, I think he sees everything. I think he knows what he needs to change.\"",
      "Shaw will not decide Amorim's future, but those quotes were strongly in favour of the 40-year-old.",
      "For: formation concerns",
      "United are at a crossroads after failing to qualify for the Champions League again. The financial picture at Old Trafford is pretty bleak and the kitty is close to running dry, if you believe Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "That's why this summer is so important. It could be a make-or-break window that decides the club's trajectory for the next five years and United must be sure they have the right coach.",
      "So is Amorim's formation the final 'game model' for Ineos' decision-makers? They must decide whether 3-4-2-1 will be the team's set-up over the next few years because that would ease concerns about backing a manager this summer who insists on playing said system.",
      "It would be a disaster to back Amorim and sign players for his formation this summer, only to sack him a few months into the season and appoint a manager who plays a different system.",
      "The academy teams currently don't play in Amorim's formation and United need to decide on their preferred style. Is this how they want United to play?",
      "Crystal Palace won the FA Cup and Inter Milan are in the Champions League final. They both play with a back-three and show the system can be successful with the right players.",
      "But there are concerns about whether United are settled on the formation and it would be a spectacular mistake to buy players who are tailor-made for Amorim and then to sack him.",
      "For: Europa League final defeat",
      "Considering United gambled everything on the Europa League final in Bilbao, a better performance was expected. United were awful against Tottenham and produced a shameful display.",
      "United struggled to lay a glove on one of the worst Tottenham sides in recent history, and they looked like the club that hadn't won a trophy since 2008. To lose a European final, against a club who are notorious for losing their bottle when it matters, in that manner was appalling and Amorim got a lot of decisions wrong.",
      "The starting XI was wrong, Amorim's tactics were wrong and his hesitation to make substitutions in the second half when the game was getting away from United didn't make sense.",
      "United did not go down fighting and never looked like equalising in the final minutes of the contest.",
      "Amorim's in-game management was lauded when he arrived from Sporting, but he failed to recognise his team selection was wrong and waited too long to introduce fresh legs.",
      "Against: lack of alternatives",
      "Earlier in the season, the thought process with Ten Hag was that he shouldn't be kept solely because there was a lack of alternatives. There was enough evidence to suggest Ten Hag needed to be sacked regardless, but Amorim's situation has not reached that stage.",
      "There is not an overwhelming body of evidence to overlook the lack of alternatives - the likes of Jose Mourinho, Kieran McKenna, Gareth Southgate, Xavi, Thomas Frank and Marco Silva - and sack Amorim.",
      "Could another coach have done a better job than Amorim this season? Probably, but that doesn't necessarily mean a change should be made this summer after just seven months.",
      "Against: trust in the academy",
      "Having a connection with the academy and trusting young players hardly matters when you're 16th in the Premier League, but Amorim does appear to understand the club's tradition.",
      "Although the promotion of some academy players to the first team has been enforced due to injuries, it has been encouraging to see Amorim give prospects the chance to be involved.",
      "It is obviously better to have a coach who is keen to give United's youngsters a chance."

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, May 23.",
      "The dust is beginning to settle on the disappointing Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and with the final match of the Premier League campaign this Sunday, attention is beginning to turn to the summer. United will be eyeing a major rebuild in the transfer window and which players stay, go or arrive will be interesting to see.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho looks more likely to leave than stay at the present moment following his outspoken comments after the Europa League final. Napoli had a bid rejected for his services in the January transfer window.",
      "Elsewhere, Matheus Cunha is seen as a top target for United and the first deal which is likely to be completed this summer. The Wolverhampton Wanderers man has a £62.5m release clause.",
      "Meanwhile, Liam Delap is believed to have held talks in Manchester this week over a move to the club this summer. Chelsea and Newcastle are also thought to be keen on the Ipswich Town man.",
      "Keep across all the United transfer updates and latest news in our dedicated blog below...",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are looking to make Cunha their first transfer of the summer.",
      "With a £62.5m release clause in his contract that the Reds are willing to activate, a deal could be finalised quickly.",
      "Due to the Club World Cup, the transfer window opens briefly on June 1 so United could have Cunha officially in the building by then.",
      "In the January transfer window, United were linked with a move for Christopher Nkunku on loan as they looked to strengthen their attack.",
      "Obviously, that move never came to pass but Fabrizio Romano reports today that Nkunku remains guaranteed to leave Chelsea at the end of this season.",
      "Contact with the Frenchman is set to start soon and interested clubs have been lurking since January for him.",
      "Earlier this year, it was reported that Rashford saw a move to Barcelona as the dream heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "MEN Sport understands that while Villa have a £40m option to buy clause for Rashford in the summer, this does not mean that they have first refusal on the winger.",
      "Therefore, Rashford does have the option to explore a move to Barcelona before entering talks with Villa.",
      "Speaking on Catalan radio station RAC 1, as quoted by TEAMtalk, Barcelona sporting director Deco has confirmed that his club do have an interest in Rashford heading into the summer transfer window.",
      "The former Chelsea man explained:",
      "We like Luis [Diaz], we like Rashford, and we like other players. Out of respect, talking about players who are under contract with other clubs is complicated. When we go to the market, there are names we know that could improve the team.",
      "According to ESPN, Amorim will demand that United look to bring in players that possess pace and strength in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed the Portuguese was fearful before the Europa League final that his team lacked these characteristics and this would ultimately cost them.",
      "Midfield is seen as a key are to improve after deals for Cunha and Delap are approved or otherwise.",
      "Despite Fernandes admitting that he will leave if United want him to in the summer, it appears there are no suggestions that the club want that to happen.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, Al Hilal see Fernandes as a priority for the summer transfer window and they would love to sign him before the Club World Cup kicks off next month.",
      "However, no direct approach to United has been made at this stage and, as far as the club sees it, they do not want to lose their captain.",
      "Amid interest from the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes has admitted that United may try to cash in on him in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed that Al Hilal would be willing to pay £120m for his services and if such a bid was to come in, United may find it difficult to reject it.",
      "Speaking to reporters after the full-time whistle in Bilbao, Fernandes said:",
      "I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go. I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "United have been reassured that the deal to sign Cunha will not be cancelled despite missing out on Champions League football next season.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano told GiveMeSport that the deal to sign the Wolves man is still set to go through soon.",
      "United already told Matheus Cunha that they are prepared to trigger the clause, so there will be no issues. And so I think it's going to be the first signing of the summer for United. And it's important to say that the player wanted this move, regardless of Champions League football or not, regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. Cunha wants to play for Manchester United, and my understanding is that he will play for Manchester United.",
      "I fear with him that we will end up selling him for £50m-£60m for PSR reasons, possibly this summer - it has been rumoured hasn't it. I fear he might go somewhere else, he might play in a 4-3-3 and he will end up scoring 25 or 30 goals for somebody. That is how good I think this lad could be. Shoehorn him into this system and I think it might be an issue because I am not sure he can play wing-back. I am not sure he is clever enough to be in that No.10 role, I am struggling to find a position for him in this system.",
      "According to TEAMtalk, Napoli are prepping a bid to sign Garnacho this summer having missed out on him in January.",
      "United rejected an offer in the region of £40m this winter but could be more open to selling at the end of the season with more time available to find a replacement.",
      "It is believed the Italians are preparing a £50m package for Garnacho and while United want £60m, the two teams are not too far away in their negotiations.",
      "Before the Europa League final, Garnacho shared an image of himself scoring in the last final he played in - the FA Cup against Manchester City.",
      "After the final whistle in Bilbao and with just 20 minutes to his name on Wednesday night, he struck back in his post-match interview.",
      "Obviously, it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.",

      "After an abysmal Premier League campaign, which could end with them 17th, United fell at the final hurdle in the Europa League. Despite his side laying no punches onto Spurs, Amorim didn't change his team until the 71st minute with Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho coming on for the two players they probably should have started over in Rasmus Hojlund and Mount.",
      "Much has been made of Garnacho's snub. The winger has publicly come out and seemingly questioned the decision for him to only get 20 minutes while his brother has also criticised the handling of him in the final by Amorim.",

      "In his Caught Offside column, Romano wrote: \"There is genuine interest from two very important clubs – Chelsea and Manchester United. Both clubs have several targets on their shortlists between them, but for sure the interest in Delap is concrete and genuine. My understanding is that Delap has spoken to Chelsea and to Manchester United, and now it’s time for him to explore all the options possible.",
      "A football finance expert has said Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday night means they will miss out on around £85million in additional revenue.",
      "Professor Rob Wilson, Director of Executive Education at University Campus of Football Business, has outlined just how costly United's failure to get back into the Champions League will be. \"Having lost the Europa League, Manchester United have probably missed out on something between £10m to £15m in direct prize money,\" Wilson told Genting Casino.",
      "\"That was made up of around £4m for winning the final, somewhere between £3m and £5m from an increased UEFA coefficient share. Then there's elements around commercial bonuses, appearance fees, match day revenues that they would have benefited from. What we then need to remember of course is that there will also be an offset there.",
      "\"So they won't have bonus payments to pay, for instance, for their player wages. So that's quite an important factor to include.

That revenue is due to broadcast, gate receipts and some of those UEFA payments.",
      "\"The fact that the club has missed out on that revenue is quite a blow to their budget line and will affect what they're able to do in the transfer market this summer, not just from an amount of cash perspective and what they can spend on transfers but also the type of players they can attract as a result of having no European football given their league position.\"",

      "Brennan Johnson's first half winner at the San Mames Stadium was enough to clinch Spurs their first trophy since 2008, meaning United, as a result, will go without European football for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign next season.",
      "After a wretched Premier League campaign, both Spurs and United were desperate to seal a backdoor route into next season's Champions League to compete with Europe's elite and boost their respective finances.",
      "United desperately needed Champions League qualification to increase head coach Ruben Amorim's transfer budget to make the rebuild he plans to oversee this summer that little bit easier.",
      "Instead, United are likely to find the transfer market harder to navigate, with their revenue streams impacted as a result of failing to qualify for Europe's premier club competition. It means they will have to be shrew with their recruitment, both in terms of incomings and outgoings.",
      "United are planning for the number of departures to reach double figures this summer, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, each of whom are currently out on loan, being identified as priority sales. The likes of Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are poised to be released when their contracts expire.",
      "However, United, to boost their transfer kitty, could be forced into making some ruthless decisions. Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, who both started the Europa League final on the bench, could be sold.",
      "But despite Fernandes' declaration that he will go if United need to sell him, chief executive Omar Berrada's comments about United's recruitment plans earlier this year suggest that will not be the case, unless, of course, an offer comes along that is too good to turn down.",
      "\"So just because we'll have more revenues to invest if we're in the Champions League, it doesn't mean we're going to go and over-invest,\" he said, speaking at the unveiling of United's new stadium plans in March. \"We need to be cautious and, and we need to try to make as many good decisions as we can in recruitment.",
      "\"And also when it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons.\"",
      "Berrada's point on sales ought to see United put a hands-off notice on Fernandes. He has been their best player yet again this season, scoring 19 goals, and deciding to sell him would instantly weaken Amorim's starting XI and squad.",
      "The United captain, who is reportedly of interest to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, has been a beacon of light in a dark and miserable season for the Reds. His goals in the Premier League have directly earned United five points and he finished the Europa League campaign as the competition's joint-top leading goalscorer with seven.",
      "Of course, if a mega-money offer is submitted that United simply cannot afford to turn down, then they must consider it for a player who will turn 31 later this year. But unless that happens, his importance to the team is more valuable than a financial offer that is unlikely to be enough to replace Fernandes with a player of equal quality.",
      "Both Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim have already waxed lyrical about Fernandes, outlining his importance and brilliance, meaning an exit is highly unlikely.",
      "And with Berrada already stating that decisions on outgoing players will rest on their importance to the team and not financial reasons, United should not be planning to let their captain go."

      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has suggested that it may be in everyone's best interests if Manchester United and Ruben Amorim were to go their separate ways this summer.",
      "After being appointed as Erik ten Hag's successor last November, United have continued to slide down the Premier League ladder under Amorim, so much so failure to beat Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon could see them finish just one place above the relegation zone.",
      "The mood at United is, of course, already at rock-bottom following Wednesday night's 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final, meaning the club will go without European football for the first time since the 2014/15 season next term.",
      "United need to make much-needed changes to their squad in this summer's transfer window, but their failure to qualify for the Champions League has impacted their budget.",
      "Amorim's obsession with his 3-4-2-1 formation mean that his recruitment needs will be specific, meaning there is no room for error. And having failed to cover himself in glory over the last few months, Carragher is fearful that United will have to spend big to recruit to his needs.",
      "He has also addressed the danger of United recruiting to Amorim's needs this summer, the club making a slow start to next season, resulting in the Portuguese chief being sacked, and his replacement reverting back to a four-man defence.",
      "\"With Amorim, you are not just committing to an individual coach,\" said Carragher, penning his column for The Telegraph. \"Backing him means getting behind a big idea; a system of play that is uncommon among the elite of Europe, requiring specialist footballers and a squad of back-up wing-backs and centre-halves so he can play three at the back.",
      "\"It means spending big on redesigning the squad to meet Amorim's specific needs in the knowledge that, if he underperforms again next season, his successor will most likely revert to a flat back-four. The blueprint is then ripped up and the club are back to square one.",
      "\"A fortune would have been wasted again and another one would be required for the next manager. Given the precariousness of United's finances, which Ratcliffe acknowledged earlier this season, can the club really afford any more expensive mistakes?",
      "\"After losing a potential £100million windfall by missing out on the Champions League, United will be gambling the short-term and long-term health of the club on Amorim leading an extraordinary revival. No wonder Ratcliffe looked haunted at the trophy presentation in Bilbao.",
      "\"This is the path United embarked upon when they headhunted Amorim. Now that his six months in charge have gone so badly, Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues will need a decisive plan for how he will navigate the club through the most challenging period in United's modern history.",
      "\"Their grave concern must be that they have seen absolutely no evidence so far to suggest he is up to it. On that basis, backing Amorim this summer may be the honourable option, but it is not necessarily the bravest.",
      "\"Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.",
      "\"To his credit, Amorim seems to empathise with his board. He understands what they must commit to if they retain his services; namely, the right personnel to execute his vision.\""

      "On the face of it, United would be lucky to generate a combined sum close to that figure if they were to sell both Rashford and Antony, highlighting just how big a challenge they are set to face this summer. Qualifying for the Champions League would have boosted their kitty and given Amorim a much bigger budget to play with.",

He still wore the Paul Smith club suit given to players for the occasion, and while the starting XI were getting their boots on, Garnacho was chatting to former United loanee Sergio Reguilon.",
      "By now, it had become clear that Garnacho wasn't starting, something first hinted at earlier in the afternoon when the 20-year-old did what 20-year-olds do, and hinted at his frustration on social media. The images of him scoring and celebrating at Wembley last season were a reminder and a rebuke to those who had now axed him for this final.",
      "Garnacho would eventually swap that suit for his kit, and his feet would get a chance to do the taking. He came on with 19 minutes to go and changed the dynamic, forcing Guglielmo Vicario into a sharp save and tormenting Pedro Porro. Several low balls in flashed across the box without a United shirt there to finish the move off.",

      "“Who missed the big opportunity in the first half in the semi-final? Garnacho. Football is like that,\" said Amorim.",
      "You could see the point he was trying to make, but it was made a little clumsily. Just down the corridor, Garnacho was preparing to deliver his own version of events. A usually reticent talker, he stopped in the mixed zone to speak to Spanish TV crews and delivered a brutal verdict on the season and his own role in the final.",
      "\"When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today… I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",

      "“Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha,” Roberto Garnacho wrote.",
      "This is the baggage that comes with Garnacho, who has already been dropped once by Amorim due to his attitude. The head coach praised the way the Argentine responded to his demotion from the squad to face Manchester City in December, but this could reopen wounds.",
      "The problem is, the bit Garnacho delivered in the middle on Wednesday night shows why he should remain a valuable member of the squad. He threatened to drag United back into the game and left the impression that they would have stood more of a chance had he started.",
      "No matter what happens against Aston Villa on Sunday, no United player will have played in more games than Garnacho this season, who made his 58th appearance of the campaign in the final. This isn't a fringe player we're talking about.",
      "But the feeling persists that he is an uneasy tactical fit for Amorim. Garnacho is desperate to play as a winger, but now has a head coach who doesn't use them. He hasn't been used as a wingback, and if he stays, his future will be as a No. 10 if the manager and player can find a balance to get the best out of him in that role.",
      "Garnacho could have left in January, with Chelsea and Napoli keen, and after Wednesday night United might well listen to offers again. His off-pitch antics won't have sat well with club officials, and the reality is that Garnacho is one of the most sellable and valuable assets in this squad, at a time when raising funds to reinvest is more vital than ever.",
      "The risks of selling are clear. Garnacho could easily leave and then thrive as a winger in Naples or elsewhere. If it doesn't work out for Amorim at Old Trafford and United go back to a head coach who wants wingers, then the sight of Garnacho excelling for another club will be another costly mistake.",

      "While United will be hoping next season's more relaxed schedule will help them rediscover their form, they may have to do it without captain Bruno Fernandes. It is understood that Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal are interested in the midfielder and Fernandes has told the media that he will leave if the club decide the time is right to cash in.",
      "It is thought Fernandes, who turns 31 in September, would be able to command an eye-watering £120m bid from Al Hilal in the summer. However, Littler is of the mindset that United should do everything in their power to get him to stay, simply replying: \"Shambles,\" to the prospect of the skipper leaving Old Trafford."

      "Amorim made his offer to walk away for free if United decide he isn't the man for the job in his post-match press conference after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham in Bilbao, but a queue of United players lined up to reaffirm their faith in the former Sporting boss.",
      "Amorim has lost 16 and won just 15 of his 41 games in charge in all competition, with just six of those victories coming in the Premier League, and Fernandes admitted it would be \"easier\" to get a different coach in now.",
      "He insists that would be the wrong approach, however, and urged club bosses to stay calm as they assess Amorim's future over the next few days following defeat at San Mames.",
      "\"It’s not my decision but I do think the manager is the right one and I don’t think that it will be a better person to come into the job and do the job,\" Fernandes said of his countryman.",
      "\"I know it's difficult to understand that, it's difficult to see that. But I still do think that he's the right man to lead the club. I do think that the club is in a situation where it's easier to get a different one in because the results haven't been there.",
      "\"But as my other teammates said, and I repeat myself, I do think he's the right man.\"",
      "Amorim has had a disastrous time at Old Trafford since taking over at the end of November and he has been open about the possibility he could get the sack in his press conferences.",
      "He called this the worst United team ever in January and also said they were in a relegation battle, and he has regularly said he expects to be replaced if he doesn't turn the club's fortunes around.",
      "\"We just agree that he's the right man. He has done a lot of good things,\" said Fernandes.",
      "\"We know that the manager is looked at by the results. Obviously we see more than that as players. We know for everyone it will be about him bringing back the positivity in the club. To try to bring the club back to fight for trophies, fight for the big trophies. And we all agree that he's the right man.\""

      "Luke Shaw went close in the dying moments, but Guglielmo Vicario was equal to his header as Spurs ended their 17-year goal drought. After the final whistle, the disappointment was written all over the faces of Amorim, his staff and the players as the reality of new European football next season hit home.",
      "Reflecting on the defeat, Fernandes took to Instagram on Thursday evening to send a defiant message to United fans and a thank you to those who supported them. \"We failed where it hurts the most, and the responsibility is ours,\" he began.",
      "\"Thanks to the players who gave everything to make the outcome different. Thank you to everyone who supported us through our most difficult times and to those who sent me messages of support throughout yesterday [Wednesday] and today.",

My eternal and heartfelt thank yous are the highlight of my day.",
      "\"Now... It’s time to reflect, learn, improve and do everything to come back... We're still together.\"",
      "Among the just under 10,000 people to like the post were United stars Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee who came on as substitutes in the final. Amorim told reporters in Bilbao that he would not be quitting but that if the fans and the board decided he was no longer the right man for the job, he would walk away without compensation."

      "The 'Spursy' mentality stuck with the north London club for 17 years, and while there are no guarantees that this win will lead to success long-term, it is a monkey off their back. United, though, cannot afford to drop into the same malaise.",
      "United find themselves at a crossroads now. On the one hand, they can learn to accept this new 'Unitedy' branding - pick up a few good results here and there, but never trouble the history books.",
      "Or, they can use it for motivation to right the wrongs next season. Even if it is a Carabao Cup success, United need to bring back that winning feeling and quickly otherwise, one trophyless campaign can be followed by another.",
      "Accepting that you are a team who just cannot get the job done is the problem which haunted Spurs for the longest time. United's rebuild will now be modest in the summer, but even if a top six finish is not forthcoming in 2025/26, they need to bring some positivity back next year because, at the moment, the club is at rock bottom."

      "Of course, Delap is still young, and his talent is raw. But he has proven this season, even at Ipswich with limited service, that he is a competent finisher who knows where the back of the net is.",
      "The problem for United, though, is that they will be unable to offer the England youth international Champions League football after losing the Europa League final.",

However, following the defeat in Bilbao, the 30-year-old conceded that he would understand if United decided to sell him – a scenario that has now become a real possibility.",
      "Although this initial approach was rejected by Fernandes' representatives, Al-Hilal remain undeterred, it is claimed, and the midfielder's candid remark to media outlets in northern Spain will have given them reason to believe a deal could still be struck.",
      "When questioned about his future, Fernandes said: \"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this.",

      "Man Utd could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season and they were dealt a severe blow on Wednesday night, losing 1-0 to Spurs in the Europa League final to miss out on a trophy and Champions League football.",
      "Carragher thinks Man Utd chiefs need to start asking whether they ‘appointed the wrong manager at the wrong time’.",
      "‘At some point during their post-season review of a dire campaign, someone in the Manchester United boardroom will need the courage to ask the toughest question: “Did we appoint the wrong manager at the wrong time?”’ Carragher wrote for The Telegraph.",

      "‘Would it suit all parties if he shook hands and walked away from Old Trafford? Many people in football would probably consider that a mutually beneficial outcome.’",

But I wasn’t completely happy with every single minute how he was on the training ground. In my opinion in certain moments he could do a bit more, to say it mildly, and that’s what we talked about.",
      "“Combined with that I said to him: ‘You are a much better defender than everybody tells you, unfortunately you don’t show it all the time, that’s why people sometimes say you are not’.",
      "“If he is just at it and focused and concentrated, there are not many players that can go around him, because he’s fast, he’s agile, he has great mentality.",

      "“These things we spoke about in pre-season.”",
      "Again, it sounds a hell of a lot like an incoming coach having some pretty standard, constructive observations about one of his new players. And the best bit is that Slot’s answer was prefaced with this line, which changes everything completely:",
      "“I think Mo has said already a few things about why he was in my office in pre-season and there were similar reasons why Trent was in my office in the beginning of the season!”",
      "So this was in pre-season and Slot had similar conversations with Salah, who recently explained: “He showed me a few videos of myself in the warm-up. I was like quite slow, didn’t do much. Then he showed me, ‘look at the second [player] after he sees you take it easy, look at the third one’. Then you see the whole line walking like me and he said, ‘that’s your influence on the team’.”",
      "Did Slot ‘turn on’ Salah and ‘fire criticism’ at him at the time? Or does it only count when the player in question is in the middle of a controversial departure?",

      "Brown told bestbettingsites.co.uk: “Yeah, I think you have to. Listen, he’s made some mistakes this season and you don’t want that from a goalkeeper. But at the same time, I feel sometimes the pressure has been immense. Maybe he’s not handled it the best way, but at the same time, he still comes back, the manager still puts him in.",
      "“Plus, I don’t think he can just sell somebody like that anyway. These players cost a lot of money. Fans need to understand, it’s not like a video game where you press one button and the player is sold. There’s a lot of factors.",
      "“And I get these questions. I mean, we all do. I have talks with my mates all the time and they’ll say ‘yeah, you should do this’. But it doesn’t work like that. I get what they’re saying, but it actually doesn’t work like that.",
      "“So, yeah, he will be there next season and you can just hope he steps up and that’s all you can do. Because if he does, then all this talk goes out the window. It’s as simple as that. But you do have to give the lads some support, if they have had some bad games, you need to let them see that they’re still good enough, even after a bad game. Otherwise, it only gets worse.",
      "“But you definitely also have to trust going forward that he’s going to give more, he’s going to get better and be more consistent, because he’s a great shot stopper at times. He’s let in some silly goals. I think everyone admits that, but I think you need to give him the chance.",
      "“Next season as we go forward, obviously there’ll be new players there as well, and then it’s up to him. At times it’s been rough, but it’s the case for every player this season. At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The INEOS brains trust can only be trusted with one more decision\nAs a United fan who didn’t even bother watching the Europa League final, I’m not the least bit surprised by the outcome. Manchester United are in complete shambles right now. The arrival of Ratcliffe has been so disastrous that even Ed Woodward starts to look like a footballing genius in comparison.",
      "United’s problems are numerous, but the most glaring issue is this: we can’t even decide what’s worse — the players or the managers. When it comes to both Erik ten Hag and Amorim, it’s safe to say that, as poor as the current squad is, the managers have been even worse. And therein lies the root of our troubles.",
      "We have no Director of Football. Our scouting network is non-existent or laughable at best. This leaves the manager (the one who can’t do their own jobs) to also do the scouting, resulting in hundreds of millions wasted on signings who have consistently failed to meet expectations. Under Ten Hag, huge sums were spent chasing his priority targets, yet almost every one of them has proven to be a disappointment. In contrast, Amorin is still demadning players for a system that has shown no evidence of working in the Premier League.",
      "The reality? United are expected to finish this season with 39 points — just above the relegation zone. In many other seasons, that would have meant relegation. Remember the outrage when United finished 7th under David Moyes, and that was without the financial backing ETH was given for instance.",
      "So what’s the solution?",
      "Unfortunately, the current management structure is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon. There will be no Director of Football appointment, no meaningful improvement to the scouting network, and no overhaul of the training facilities. The people in charge simply don’t seem capable of making the right decisions.",
      "This leaves us with only one viable option — one that comes with the caveat that it has not worked out too well in the past but is the only realistic path forward now. We need to hire an experienced, truly elite manager. Someone with a proven track record of winning titles and the full backing of the club. This manager should be entrusted with all football decisions — from which players to buy and sell, to upgrading facilities, restructuring the medical team, and establishing a reliable scouting and data analysis network.",
      "Most importantly, this manager must be given complete autonomy, no matter how much resistance or dissent there may be from players, he must be backed to the hilt season after season. Because the only thing the current board and management can be trusted with is one decision only, hiring the manager. And that too out of sheer necessity. Beyond that, let the only adult at the club (read: new manager hopefully) make all the decisions from thereon. Because, this United board and management have proven repeatedly that to allow them to make even a single more decision would be folly of the highest order.\nAdeel",
      "",
      "So, for the third season in a row, United found themselves in a cup final looking to salvage their season, only this time, they went to the well and they found there was nothing left for them.",
      "You can’t keep putting off the inevitable. This is a large scale rebuild. It will involve gradually shipping out 10 players and trying to bring in 10 who are an improvement on those going out. That’s a 3, 4, 5 year project. There is no quick fix. There are no shortcuts. The last two years have been sticking plasters, but you can’t keep putting plasters on open fractures. Sooner or later you have to accept that you require more advanced help.",
      "As I have said previously, the problem with United is that are yet to confront their reality. They may have the most Instagram followers in Kenya or whatever, but that is worth absolutely nothing on a football pitch. They need to accept where they are and what they are. Until they do, they will continue to go backwards.\nAndy H, Swansea.",

      "Dramatic? Perhaps. But if the Europa League final really was “do or die”, well, United didn’t “do”. It feels like a death knell and I expect a lot of black worn at Old Trafford on Sunday for the blessed relief of the season finale. We didn’t deserve to win the Europa and certainly do not deserve Champions League football in 2025-26.",
      "You know things are bad when rival fans have (mostly) stopped laughing and are expressing sincere concern. I guarantee Spurs will be nowhere near the bottom 3 next season. I wish I could express the same confident claim about my own club, but I for one just cannot see an escape out of this doom spiral.",
      "Our best players are likely to be moved on (for tuppence ha’penny, natch); our once-coveted manager looks like he’s hating every single minute of his life and our tight-as-a-gnat’s arse part-owner is similarly regretting his life choices, whilst looking for all the world like a child’s doodle of a medieval king magically made flesh.",
      "The Championship is beckoning. Money can only insulate you from failure for so long in football. The last time we were relegated in 1974, it was only six years after becoming England’s first champions of Europe. With greater finances involved in modern football, it has insulated us for longer, but not for much longer, at this rate in any case. I will never stop loving my club and all its glorious (and inglorious) history, but I am really not looking forward to more of the same next season.",
      "A good start would be to stop losing to Spurs! Nothing against them, but four defeats to Tottenham in the same season? Four?! That’s insane. I’m pleased for big Ange, a man often luckless, scorned and derided. But to actually deliver on his pre-season pledge to “always” win a trophy in his second season?

      "Manchester United (1878-2025) is over. I was thinking earlier this season, as a Liverpool fan, that if somehow they got relegated I would quit watching football or caring about the Premier League altogether (not the Champions League of course….) because it would be meaningless to entertain a rivalry when your biggest rival has been destroyed beyond repair. Of course, they didn’t get relegated -but gave it shot- yet United being United, they managed to produce an outcome just as humiliating and unbelievable; lose a European final to Tottenham. (To add insult to injury, without Maddison, Kulusevski, Bergvall…. basically, their best attacking options) 🤯",
      "Lost a European final to Tottenham… (try not to laugh reading that over and over again). They will have to live with that stain forever now. The last European trophy Spurs won was against Anderlecht, a club which fittingly has disappeared from the world stage. How do you live past that as a “proud football club” when Tottenham was the perennial butt of jokes for a reason?? Even hours before the match Paul Scholes was asked to revisit on TV the “lads, it’s Tottenham” pep talk Fergie gave them in the dressing room which became a meme, running joke, soundbite whatever to exemplify the complete helplessness and failure inherent to Tottenham. And yet, you’ve become their b****, Spurs beat them 4 times this season!!! 🤣",
      "In the end of the day, level at league titles and with twice as many European cups, the history books will tell the story that Liverpool beat Tottenham in a Champions League final but Manchester United lost to Spurs in a Europa League final. There are levels to this game. Liverpool has to find a new “biggest fixture” to look forward to because the English Derby no longer is. We may have to manufacture a rivalry with City going forward because United died this season. They’re just the gift that keeps on giving, having perfected the art of failure. You could not script a better season ending from a Liverpool fan’s standpoint.\nRaúl H. García (Number 7 next season and I’m done) LFC-YNWA 1892",
      "",
      "I was reading bits of the mailbox and Man Utd fans thinking out loud about how to forge a path ahead. Youth was mentioned an awful lot but here is the thing: if you were a talented player under 16 you would not sign for Man Utd right now.",
      "To protect kids and not disrupt families most clubs have to recruit within a geography but that means that Man Utd are competing with Man City and Liverpool for top youth players. Which team would you rather sign for if you were 12 years old right now?",
      "There’s no class of 92 that’s going to be emerging any time soon in my opinion. And the class of 92 had top professionals like Cantona to learn from; who would a kid in the youth team look up to right now other than Bruno?",
      "The club has cancer and it’s been allowed to persist so long that it’s infected almost everything. That combined with a disgruntled feeling from all the staff who Genius Jim has screwed to save £58 a week means that the morale couldn’t be lower.",
      "I don’t see Amorim as the answer and this £100m summer war Chest won’t go far when so much is about to be spent on Cunha making a step down.",
      "I’m obviously enjoying this malaise rather a lot. The summer of optimism will also be great before it comes crashing down on opening day when you lose at home to Fulham.\nMinty, LFC",
      "",
      "We do talk about Bruno\nI was really glad one of your 16 Conclusions on the final picked up on the double Bruno Fernandes turnover in the Spurs half prior to the goal. This gets glossed over so many times, especially when United play well or get a result. The amount of times he gives the ball away unnecessarily is astonishing.",
      "It got me to thinking after the game. If Fernandes were the talisman he is reputed to be. If he’s such a great goal scorer, creator, leader, why have none of the big clubs not come in for him? At the very least, why has there not been the odd rumour at the end of a non-disastrous season, linking him with Spain, Italy or Bayern?",
      "I think the answer to this is that they don’t want him. Is he a good player? Absolutely! But he’s not good enough to be constantly forgiven his wasteful passes, Hollywood balls, whining and moaning at the ref and team mates? I can’t understand how the 6 managers (interim included) he’s worked under since joining United have all deemed him undroppable. Not just that, he’s rarely subbed off",
      "United are in a very precarious position right now. There was talk earlier this season of a relegation battle. I shrugged that off, thinking there’s no way the quality of the teams at the bottom of the table would threaten a side of full internationals. But watching the game last night I could honestly say that I wouldn’t put a tenner on United to beat any of the 3 relegated sides if they were to meet in a week’s time with full strength sides. I don’t think the teams coming up this season from the Championship will be as bad as the 3 going down and I think Leeds and Burnley will have learned their lessons form previous bounces and prepare better for the upcoming top flight season.",
      "So if United want to keep doing the same thing, with the same players, then I genuinely feel next season could be worse than this. And if Bruno Fernandes is still the captain, playing 90 mins every week, no matter how bad his performances are, then they can have no complaints if next May they find themselves in must win matches to avoid dropping to the championship.",
      "I would like to clarify that I’m not laying all the blame for the current sh*t show at his feet. There are a number of players not fit to wear the shirt and the managers have to take a lot of blame too. But this is one area that seems to be constantly ignored and needs to be debated. Are United better off with Fernandes or without. Some fans might see Fernandes leaving as the last finger pulled from the dyke but I think his removal from the team would allow others to step up with an increased focus on in-game tactics. Just look what happened PSG when Mbappe left and the team became less of a one man show.\nMick, Newcastle",
      "",
      "Tinpot\nI’d like to address the concept that because of the finalists poor league performance and the poor quality game that the Europa League is now a tinpot trophy and shouldn’t get CL qualification.",
      "By this logic Wigan’s famous win, which wasn’t a great game, the same year they got relegated made the FA cup a championship level competition not worth European qualification.",
      "What about Denmark or Greece winning the Euros? Not the biggest teams nor the best football which would make that competition tinpot now as well.",
      "Do we really want to post decide the value of a sporting success based on the winner’s performance in a separate sporting competition? Is it worth nothing unless one of the big successful teams win it?",
      "But far worse than the subjective, post-rationalised logic is the inhumanity. The denial of one of the most nourishing, heart warming stories that sport brings so wonderfully to life.

Even Tiramisu becomes boring after the fifteen bowl. Probably. The rewards being divided between the wealthy few is bad for everyone so I make this a good season.",

      "Man Utd have responded to an offer from Ruben Amorim to leave Old Trafford without compensation after losing the Europa League final on Wednesday.",

      "Man Utd are 16th in the Premier League heading into the final weekend of fixtures with the Red Devils winning just ten matches all season.",
      "It has been a campaign full of misery for Amorim – who was already reportedly talked out of resigning earlier this season – and the Man Utd boss offered to leave without compensation on Wednesday after their defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Amorim said: “In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself. I cannot do it, it is really hard for me.",

      "“So in this moment it is a little bit of faith. Let’s see. I am always open, if the board and the fans feel I am not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation.",
      "“But I will not quit. I am really confident on my job. As you can see I will not change nothing in the way I do things.”",
      "But the Daily Telegraph have claimed that Man Utd ‘refuse to take up’ Amorim’s offer to resign and leave without compensation.",
      "It is understood that the Man Utd boss ‘retains the full backing’ of the club’s board and that ‘Amorim’s position is unaffected by Wednesday’s defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final as they prepare to intensify efforts to reshape a chronically underperforming squad to the manager’s needs this summer’.",
      "Man Utd ‘accepted this season was always going to be a challenge as they transitioned to a new system and style of play’ and that Amorim ‘was always aware his future was not contingent on the outcome of one game, or his calamitous first season and that the United hierarchy accept they are facing a long-term rebuild that requires time and patience’.",
      "The Red Devils will look to provide Amorim with the tools he needs to make Man Utd successful again next season with Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo two of the names linked.",
      "After hearing speculation about Cunha and Mbeumo, Man Utd legend Dwight Yorke told gamblingindustrynews.com: “Cunha is a good player. I like him. I like the look of him from his time at Wolves. He will bring some grit and some decisiveness, and a little bit more conviction in the attacking areas, and a greater presence. He’s got a little bit of fire in his belly which is what we need. I like that about him.",
      "“I rate Mbeumo too. He has had an exceptional season this year.  I like Liam Delap too, the lad at Ipswich. I know people talk about him a lot as well.",
      "“These are three good players, and that’s what United need. They need exceptional players to take the club forward. I’m less sure about Mbeumo and Delap, but Cunha has a little bit more about him. He’s the kind of player I want to watch at United, he’s more exciting.",

      "It’s the final Premier League weekend of the season and that means it’s permutations time as the European places are settled, but to be honest we’re far more interested in joining the great big party that’ll be going off at Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Liverpool v Crystal Palace\nLook, are there bigger and more important games on this weekend? Yes. Pretty much all of them in one way or another.",
      "But how often do any of us get the chance to watch a Premier League game that is less football match and more massive communal party? It will end with Liverpool receiving the Premier League trophy they won bloody ages ago now by beating a Tottenham team that – and this is impossible to imagine now – was in the grip of a banterously long trophy drought.",
      "But it isn’t just the home team having a big party here, with Crystal Palace also jubilant having sauntered past 50 Premier League points for the first time ever and also if less importantly won the FA Cup to nab their first ever piece of major silverware.",
      "Just a game where a lovely time can be had by all. Get Palace to bring the FA Cup with them. Delay the kick-off because everyone is just too busy giving each other guards of honour.",
      "The (very tenuously semi-) serious point here is that this should be one of the most happily cigars out and flip-flops on football matches ever staged and thus has rich potential to be one of those proper end-of-season games that ends 5-5 or some such silliness, where by the end the delirious fans of both teams are cheering every goal and wondering how on earth they’re going to make it to August with only transfer bumwash and the unwanted Club World Cup to sustain us.",
      "Other sadly untelevised but very live contenders for 5-5 style shenanigans on the final day include but are not limited to: Wolves v Brentford, Fulham v Man City and of course Tottenham v Brighton.",
      "",
      "Team to watch: Nottingham Forest\nBy far the most interesting of the Champions League chasers by simple virtue of novelty, while we also can’t deny we enjoy the fact that the Premier League could send interlopers off to the Big Cup for two years in a row, and those teams both in fact be former winners of said cup from before football was invented.",
      "Alas, a team that had everything safely in their own hands, spending much of the season in the top three, has wobbled sufficiently to leave their chances of a top-five finish now on the slender side.",
      "Even a month ago, Forest were sitting pretty in fourth, with a game in hand that could take them back above Man City and a three-point lead over Chelsea in sixth.",
      "Four games and five points later, they are on the outside looking in. The fact they face Chelsea on the final day is a half-full or half-empty situation depending on how you choose to view it.",
      "While they face undeniably the hardest task of the five teams scrapping for the remaining three places alongside Liverpool, Arsenal and – stop giggling – Tottenham in next season’s Champions League, they do at least know that a win for them automatically takes care of one of the two failures they need from a rival.",
      "If Forest take care of their own business they just need a stumble from Villa or Newcastle. And while Forest’s form has stalled – although it has by no means been a total collapse – they have had enough memorable days at the City Ground this season to believe they can deliver one last blow to the establishment, if only to save Nuno Espirito Santo from another confrontation with an angry iPhone 7-wielding owner.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Ruben Amorim\nOne of the great unique elements about the final day is the vast chasm in importance it can carry for two clubs in the same game.",
      "Sure, your Nottingham Forest v Chelseas are great, all-to-play-for head-to-heads that can determine the success or failure of entire seasons. And we’ve already dispensed with our usual miserabilism to look fondly at the great big party that’s about to go off at Anfield for Premier League winners Liverpool and FA Cup winners Crystal Palace.",
      "But perhaps the most fun final-day games are those between teams still fighting for a big prize and those who have just had their dreams crushed to dirt by the only club in the entire country that might be as ridiculous as they are.",
      "Step forward, Manchester United and their beleaguered life-choices-reconsidering manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The good news for Amorim and the lads is that they will almost certainly avoid the ignominy of finishing 17th even in the very likely event that they cannot rouse themselves from Wednesday night’s disappointment in Bilbao to stop an in-form, Champions League-chasing Aston Villa.",
      "But that’s only because Tottenham’s preparation for their own final game of the season against Brighton has been comprised entirely of memes, full-kit wankering, beer, cigars, parades and settling 17-year-old scores with Domino’s Pizza.",
      "While last-laugh-having Postecoglou faces the challenge of identifying his 11 least hungover players, Amorim and his team face an altogether different kind of headache.",
      "There is a grim fascination to be had in watching just what kind of performance Amorim and United are able to pluck from their arse against a very good side with no thoughts yet of the beach. We have a strong suspicion that the answer is ‘sh*tbone awful’ but, while nothing can be done now to save a season that saw all its remaining eggs trampled under Cristian Romero’s boots on Wednesday, a broken club in utter disarray could do with at least something to send them into the summer with some vague hope that things might be all right in the end.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Cole Palmer\nSympathy for Chelsea is not something generally in great supply, but there is some to be found for Enzo Maresca and his players as they attempt to manage their way through a frankly unprecedented set of circumstances.",
      "As almost everyone else’s season winds down, or in many cases has long since already wound down, the Blues face a decisive Champions League six-pointer at Forest on Sunday, then a European final three days later, and then after a moment to catch their breath head off to the States for the Club World Cup that absolutely everybody definitely wanted and needed and is in no way just a giant player-flogging FIFA cash cow.",
      "In circumstances like these, it is entirely unhelpful for your only real recognised number nine to bag himself a three-game suspension. Nicolas Jackson has done just that, though, and is still out for the vital trip to the City Ground.",
      "With Christopher Nkunku and Marc Guiu also out or at the very best extremely doubtful, the challenge of getting Chelsea over the line here before turning attention to the uncommonly large and important challenges that still await them in this never-ending season falls on the likes of Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto and Jadon Sancho, back in contention here having been ineligible for the win over Manchester United.",
      "It really is a time when Chelsea could do with Palmer stepping up after a Difficult Second Season. Or Difficult Second Half Of Second Season, more fairly.",
      "Last month’s from-behind win at Fulham was, absurdly, Chelsea’s first and only Premier League away win since a 4-3 caper at Tottenham in early December. It’s a 10-game run in which Chelsea have scored only five goals and been shut out six times.",
      "Palmer himself hasn’t scored a Premier League goal away from home since opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw at Palace on the first weekend of January. That came near the end of a run of seven goals in nine Premier League games.",
      "His only goal since that run was a nerve-settling late penalty in the 3-1 win over a partying Liverpool.",
      "Sunday, at a team with the joint best home defensive record in the league, would be a fine time to step up. And unlike at almost every other club in the country, it’s even quite a useful time to get back into form for the further challenges that lie immediately ahead.",
      "",
      "Football League game to watch: Sheffield United v Sunderland\nWe’ve already had a curious taste of a play-off final style game thanks to the unique circumstances that turned this year’s Europa League final into a Champions League play-off, with much attention given to the financial prize on offer and the chance for one of the two teams to spend next season being ritually humiliated at a higher level for which they are painfully ill-equipped and unprepared.",
      "So yeah, nothing at all like the Championship play-off final. Hopefully this will be at least a more watchable and entertaining game than we saw in Bilbao, and the Championship play-off final does traditionally deliver on that front.",
      "There’s no chance of a new club in the Premier League this time around with Sheffield United and Sunderland bidding to join other familiar faces from Leeds and Burnley.",
      "Sunderland would bring the greater novelty having not been seen in the top flight since 2017 and spending a good few years of the interim down in League One, but it’s Sheffield United – automatic promotion contenders for most of the season – who will start as favourites.",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Napoli v Cagliari\nWe generally try to avoid Friday night games but the Serie A title race is clearly the place to go this weekend and that means Friday night lights are our only option as Napoli and Inter scrap it out for the title.",
      "Both slipped up last weekend, leaving Napoli a point clear and with destiny still in their own hands as they seek a second title success in three years. Victory over Cagliari will do the job, delivering Antonio Conte a Serie A title with a third club after also tasting glory with Inter and Juventus.",
      "In a wildly out-of-character move, Conte has fallen out with the suits at Napoli which means this might be a brief yet glorious reign.",
      "Inter travel to Como at the same time on Friday hoping to do all they can to benefit from any further slip-up in Naples.",

      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi – £34m in August 2019",
      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "",
      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",
      "Mata, on the other hand, will probably forever remain the top scorer of Ryan Giggs’ entire career as a club manager.",
      "",
      "Nemanja Matic – £40m in July 2017\nFrom: Chelsea (1st)\nTo: Manchester United (6th)",
      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Liverpool have been linked with a British record £126m move for Florian Wirtz, which will push Man Utd and Chelsea embarrassments down the list.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Manchester City want to sign a Newcastle star to replace one of their stalwarts for the Club World Cup and beyond.",
      "Mason Mount’s big night in Europe could spark a renaissance, with the Man Utd star and seven more Big Six strugglers set for an upturn next season…",
      "Cole Palmer forgot the golden rule of live TV as he delivered an honest interview in the wake of breaking his Chelsea goal drought.",
      "Jamie Carragher has criticised Chelsea for a poor season and insists ‘they must start satisfying’ Cole Palmer or he’ll leave."

      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has refused to rule out the prospect of Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim has had a torrid time since replacing Erik ten Hag towards the end of 2024 as he’s struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation at Man Utd.",
      "United’s performances under Amorim have been worse than they were during Ten Hag’s tenure as they could still finish 17th in the Premier League this season.",
      "The Red Devils have lost 18 Premier League games this season, while they also came up short in the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League.",

      "READ: Rock-bottom for Amorim and Man Utd? No, it really could get worse…",
      "This result leaves Man Utd with a limited transfer budget ahead of a season without European football and Amorim remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "Man Utd’s displays under Amorim have been pretty shambolic, but it would still be pretty unfair to sack him before he’s had the opportunity to build a squad that’s more suited to his system.",
      "It has consistently been reported in recent weeks that the head coach would retain Man Utd’s backing even if they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final and this is likely the case, but Romano has not shut the exit door completely.",
      "“The message we are getting from Manchester United is that they stick with the manager. They support the manager,” Romano insisted.",
      "“They believe Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job. So Manchester United’s intention is to continue with Ruben Amorim.",
      "“So unless something completely crazy happens, which is something that sometimes in football can happen after big disappointments, but the clear idea of the club is to continue with Ruben Amorim and to support Ruben Amorim.”",
      "However, a report from The Daily Mail claims Man Utd’s squad are ‘split’ on Amorim amid one main concern.",
      "While it is noted that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the rest of United’s board are ‘standing by’ Amorim, there is a clash ‘over their support of the head coach’ in the dressing room.",
      "It is pointed out that Bruno Fernandes, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot backed Amorim publicly after the loss to Spurs, but other players do not agree.",
      "‘A number of other players feel the 40-year-old is too over-confident in his approach, and cannot understand why he puts so much faith in a playing system that is not suited to the squad he inherited in November.’",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been accused of committing a “sackable offence” in his side’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",

      "Man Utd were second best in Bilbao as they deservedly lost 1-0 to Premier League rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who have claimed the trophy, Champions League football and a huge injection of cash.",
      "The Red Devils offered little in attack as Spurs comfortably managed to hold their side at bay, with head coach Ruben Amorim under fire for his team selection.",
      "One notable call came as he named Alejandro Garnacho among the substitutes and only brought the winger on for the final 20 minutes.",
      "This angered Garnacho, who has opened the door to an exit in a bombshell interview after being “thrown under the bus” by Amorim.",
      "Reacting to these comments, Jordan blasted the winger, who has been described as a “little weakling”.",

      "Jordan has also predicted Man Utd’s Premier League finish next season, with a “bounce” from 16th expected.",
      "“We’re seeing an erosion and if it keeps going for another ten years, you’re going to see the analogy that I made of Manchester City being Red Bull and Manchester United being Ferrari, being eroded because the next generation of fans are light upon winners and United are not winners,” Jordan added.",
      "“I think we just saw United hit the bottom. You cannot make a case for Manchester United to be finishing 16th in the Premier League, two places above the relegation spot and putting out a performance.",
      "“United were abject and they’ve lost the final in such an abject manner with so much riding on it, so many opportunities to change the direction of travel.",
      "“I think you’ve just witnessed the United beast hit the bottom and then that’s when you start to bounce and I think you’ll see a bounce. Now, what that bounce looks like, it might mean that United finish tenth next season and not 17th.”",

      "This is what rock-bottom looks like, is it?",
      "Manchester United fans, with a view skewed by years of Sir Alex Ferguson-led glory, assumed many, many times in the dozen years since that the nadir had been reached. Nope. Come 6pm on Sunday while likely looking up from 17th in the Premier League, all that is left beneath is the Championship.",
      "Until now, the thought of Manchester United being relegated has been restricted to the wet dreams of ABUs. Logic says the club is simply too big to fail so spectacularly. But this is not the United of old. F*** knows what this United is.",
      "Now, barely a night’s sleep after losing the Europa League final, it is too much to explore in depth all the issues that make the Red Devils the undisputed banter champions of the world. Too much. Too sad.",
      "In short: United are a failed state. Once the richest of world superpowers, now unashamedly penny-pinching and staff-shedding in an attempt to live within its means, while those most culpable for their decline – players, executives, owners – trouser their grotesque salaries and dividends.",
      "The Glazers don’t give a f***. They milk their ailing cash cow from behind the safety of an INEOS-shaped shield, fronted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe carrying the look of billionaire regretting his life choices. At his stage of life, he doesn’t need this sh*t.",
      "And that’s precisely what the team have served up on a bi-weekly basis. At least, unlike Ratcliffe, the players and coaching staff are only tied to the boulder dragging them to the ocean floor for as long their contracts dictate. Or until someone, anyone, offers to pay actual money for them.",
      "There is perhaps one player, Bruno Fernandes, whose departure would be mourned by a majority of supporters. For many of his team-mates, there would be long queues of fans willing to piggy-back them to their next destination.",
      "It is too simple to say they don’t care. Most do, though predominantly with self-preservation in mind. Being a United player in recent years has been a cushy gig. Unlike other clubs, the personal rewards – the highest salaries and biggest profiles – were guaranteed regardless of the team’s fortunes. It is why Old Trafford remained an attractive destination, even while it was crumbling, literally and metaphorically.",
      "Not now. Would you advise any player to join this circus? Instinctively, the motives and sanity of anyone signing for United this summer will be questioned. Any top talent with a modicum of sense and palatable alternatives would drop their shoulder on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Poor Ruben. He did not want to join United mid-season and, in hindsight, he should have stuck to his guns. It highlights that as recently as six months ago, United still had something like the pull of old to make him doubt his instincts. Now, his first summer coincides with the first in generations when the club has so little to advertise.",
      "If Amorim was a pragmatist, he would consider resigning. He has offered to leave without compensation if the board and fans feel he should. Though he has failed to deliver anything like the improvement that was expected when he replaced Erik ten Hag, or even just a continuation of that dross, he probably still has an acceptable approval rating among fans. Barely.",
      "But if he looks at the task now before him, are his targets achievable? Just a fortnight ago, it was said that Amorim had been set the goal of a top-six finish next season. Would he honestly back himself to get what he admits is the ‘worst-ever Manchester United team’ up at least 11 places amid the chaos likely to ensue in the coming months?",
      "If so, crack on. If not, he’s still new enough in the job to deny ownership of the sh*tshow around him and leave with his reputation bruised rather than battered, beaten and left for dead in a gutter.",
      "If you ask supporters, most would probably prefer to avoid another managerial change. Who else is there? Amorim is a likeable fella and many fans appreciate his honesty even if outsiders don’t. But suspicion grows that he doesn’t help himself.",
      "He was appointed as one of Europe’s brightest young coaches with an admirable, steadfast belief in his principles and system. For as long as he’s in charge, United will be playing 3-4-2-f***ing-1.",
      "Which, of course, makes them hilariously easy to play against, especially while he has a squad wholly unsuited to it. It is lost on precisely nobody that a must-win final between two coaches who refuse to adapt was won by the one who eventually did.",
      "Amorim admitted in the wake of the Europa League final defeat that without tangible evidence of improvement, he is asking for ‘a little bit of faith’. Blind faith, that, when the manager has neither the means to play his way or the will to even consider the possibility of another.",
      "In the absence of anything else to cling to, Amorim will probably get what he’s asked for. Maybe he’ll repay that faith. But amid the post-Bilbao gloom, after a 21st defeat of the season, it is entirely conceivable that United have depths yet to plumb.",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher has floated a ‘mutually beneficial outcome’ for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United amid one ‘grave concern’.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been accused of committing a “sackable offence” in his side’s Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s loss to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final ‘confirmed’ a ‘fear’ that Ruben Amorim has about his squad.",
      "Man Utd have responded to an offer from Ruben Amorim to leave Old Trafford without compensation after losing the Europa League final on Wednesday.",
      "It’s the final weekend of the season and that means permutations time as the European places are settled while Liverpool host a giant party.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has refused to rule out the prospect of Manchester United sacking Ruben Amorim after the Europa League final."

      "Thing is, I don’t understand the double standards from the fans. When Ole was all about counter-attacking, he was lampooned (while doing better). When Ten Hag had to adapt to the players available in the meantime, he was derided for a lack of discernible style (while doing better). Amorim’s tactic is ALL about counter-attack at pace, yet we simply don’t see this in action at all. When we launched long balls to Fellaini, Weghorst and Scotty, the manager was mocked. But it’s ok for Amorim to do it less effectively with Maguire?",
      "As many others have said, while painful, this is arguably a preferable result. It’s not like we were going to be allowed to celebrate it anyway. The club needs a reset with a number of high-profile players being sold or just plain culled. It needs to go back to being built around youth. We need that youthful running and fearlessness, we need that hunger, we need players who are about the team not themselves, we need players from the academy and area. And as a result of this “performance”, we now can’t realistically afford to keep these big-wage players. It’s time to act like we were actually relegated, clear the deadwood, and rebuild properly, whether we keep Amorim or not.",
      "Critically, the club needs to be shot of players who regularly get exposed in the biggest games. Obviously, I’m thinking Maguire in particular there who once again exposed, Shaw (powers definitely now very waned) as he has done on repeat down the years. I’m also thinking one-trick Bruno who once again couldn’t pass in between the cracks and just pinged balls out wide. I’ll say it again: Bruno has personally *missed* as many big chances as he has created. Too often, he was more interested in moaning at his team-mates than being available for the pass.",
      "Back to the main villain here though, forget the refusal to make substitutions in a timely manner – poor Amad was run out by the 60th minute, having been kicked all game – the introduction of Mainoo with 2 minutes of regular time left was a f***ing insult. This guy has the perfect skill set for exactly this kind of game where space is tight, but no… seems Ineos want to get him to accept being sold, so puppy dog Amorim won’t play him.",
      "Players like Mainoo, Amad, Heaven, Yoro, Ugarte and even poor Dorgu – who seems to have lost confidence to run at his man – are more important to the future of this club than this manager. Or indeed the asset-stripping, cost-reducing part-owners.",

      "And that is a complete reset. This squad is utterly terrible, and also really small. ETH got rid of loads and only brought in a small number of bodies – at great expense – almost all of whom haven’t worked out. Manchester United went into a major European final with 1 single striker, who is an unproven kid completely out of form. No options on the bench. No Ole on to win it. Nothing. Maguire up front.",

This season it really isn’t like that, with so much quality across 15 odd places. And you know what? Most of the teams haven’t been built by ridiculous overspending.",

      "As a United fan I am deeply worried. Not because we lost in a final to the 17th best team in England but because if you haven’t notice United can’t actually beat any of the top 16 teams in England not called Manchester United. Not only that but we have a team that is seemingly full of players – with few exceptions – that are physically incapable of performing in their designated league.",
      "United play at half pace compared to the good English teams (including Spurs). I am worried this is down to both the manager AND the players. If it’s one or the other I can work with it and have some patience but I think it might be both. This would mean yet another full reset is needed. After every other reset that has followed a managerial appointment in the last 13 years and counting.",
      "If we err on the side of optimism and say Amorim is just hampered by his players (we are at least starting to dominate possession even if we aren’t doing anything with it) then let’s look at the squad (again, because everyone wants another United deep dive).",
      "Onana – not good enough. In his prime.\nBayindir – not good enough. In his prime.\nHeaton – old",
      "Dorgu – has the physicality and possibly some skill but is still inexperienced\nShaw – fragile, cannot be trusted to play every week, hasn’t performed consistently for United in two years. Also turns 30 in July.\nDalot – availability is his biggest asset. Not great going forward. In his prime\nMazraoui – has been surprisingly available, good defender, not great going forward. In his prime\nMaguire – old, plodding, not reliable in any sense, annoyingly stupid occasionally and prone to mistakes. Good for ten minutes in each game as a centre forward though\nYoro – inexperienced but definitely going to be a great player if he avoids injuries\nDe Ligt – a younger Maguire. In his prime.\nMartinez – injury prone, short. But a fan favourite and we love him. In his prime.\nLindelof – old and never good enough (wasted a minute for spurs by complaining about time added on\nHeaven – young but looks like he has potential and physicality\nAmass – looks a baller but he’s tiny! Young and inexperienced\nFredricson – has done ok when he’s played. Young and inexperienced\nMalacia – probably not good enough but also lacking physicality, especially after his injury. Hasn’t played the full 90 mins on loan for PSV since March. In his prime.\nJonny Evans – too old and injured",
      "Bruno – heart and would of the team. Brilliant but frustrating. Getting on a bit.\nUgarte – should be approaching his prime but can’t get in the side against Spurs in a European final. Does he lack the pace and passing ability for the Premier League?\nEriksen – slow, old, past it\nCasemiro – see Eriksen\nMainoo – huge potential but easy to get past. Lack of physicality.\nToby Collyer – looks ok when fit. Tenacious if limited passing ability (from what we’ve seen).\nDan Gore – tiny but tenacious. Young and massively inexperienced\nMount – theoretically a proper Premier League player in his prime. Practically an unknown entity due to injuries.",
      "Hojlund – still young, lacking confidence. Probably also lacking skill, strength and intelligence. Has the size and speed (and possibly the ability) to trouble defences acrosss the world but hasn’t figured out how to use it. Quite possibly never will under the spotlight at United.\nMarcus Rashford – skillful, fast, strong when he wants to be, in his prime. Performs only in fits and starts and doesn’t want to be at United (don’t necessarily blame him for the latter). Still only 27.\nZirkzee – seems quite decent. Has the physicality and the skill to play in the Oremier league, not necessarily the speed. Can. Not. Shoot. Still young(ish)\nAmad – young, skillful, great at pressing but lacks physicality when on the ball and entering the box. Has scored seven league goals this year but three were against Southampton.\nGarnacho – Still young. Much like Amad seems a little lightweight but doesnt necessarily work as hard. Slight better quality with his shooting though. Exciting player to watch.\nAntony – should be in his prime. Rubbish for United after an ok first season. Lighting up the Conference League for Betis. Not a Premier League quality forward though could be repurposed as a wing back?\nEthan Wheatley – Young, massively inexperienced. No idea if he has the talent required at the top level.\nChido Obi – lots of hype. Tall but needs to fill out. Only 17. Could be a good player, could disappear.\nSancho – should be in his prime. Not apparently quick enough or physical enough for the Premier League. Seems to have some other baggage.",
      "Right so from that list of 34 players we have 14 players that are still young and unproven in the Premier League. 7 players are passsed it (or never were it), including Luke Shaw who has been a walking injury for far too long. That leaves 13 who are in their prime (or should be) but that includes two goalkeepers who are definitely not performing at the required level, at least three players who have big question marks over their injury records and at least three who are currently plying their trade elsewhere because they want to leave the club. Malacia is a combination of all three (except the goalkeeper part). This leaves us with four competent outfield players in their prime who have no question marks over their quality* or availability: Dalot, Mazraoui, Fernandes, Ugarte. And the jury is probably out on Ugarte.",
      "I wouldn’t be totally upset if United shed 13 players this summer. But if we shed the ones I’m thinking about, we’d be down to a squad of 21, 14 of which would fit in that young and inexperienced bracket. I think this is potentially disastrous. Not for the first time in its history United are over reliant on young players to perform. Whilst there is bags of potential there, the Premier League is less forgiving than at any time in the past and most of those players are lacking the physicality or composure to thrive in it.",
      "Equally, United are now incentivised to sell the best of those players before selling the 13 I mentioned. In doing so, the soul of the club will be damaged as a result, even if you don’t think Garnacho or Mainoo are good enough.",
      "All this is to say that United are now more than open heart surgery away from competing in the Premier League. Fans will be expecting a bounce back into Europe next year. Some will even fancy a Champions League spot or a title push. The reality is that the first goal – for the first time in the Premier League era – will be to get to 40 points. Based on the current squad, anything else will be a bonus.",
      "Perhaps we’ll be able to say a lot of those young players have come of age next year and everyone will stop being injured and we’re no longer looking at a squad containing 4 players in their prime. If we do so then we’ve had a better season than this one by a long stretch. But then we could also be relegated for the first time in 50+ years.\nAshmundo (quietly pleased for Ange, mate)",
      "*in terms of being good enough to play in the league, not win it. By the latter measure we are very fucked indeed.",
      "It’s who real fans are, mate\nLast night the football wasn’t great, but as the fans of either team could tell you, on such an occasion the only thing that matters is the result. Shortly after the final whistle two of my three sons drove down to Tottenham just to be part of the celebration. Since I started taking the boys to Spurs in the early nineties, the celebrations have been fairly thin.",
      "However, they’ve ignored the glory hunters they grew up with, (who probably couldn’t find certain northern cities on a map, but claim to be die hard fans nonetheless), so their joy at the final whistle was a real pleasure for me.",
      "I finished my beer whilst reading this site and a couple of others, and it crystallised the ‘online universe’ of football fans.",
      "The volume of messages demeaning the Spurs achievement with tired old cliches “tallest dwarf”, “bald men and combs” are so typical of the online football universe, especially irritating from fans of clubs not involved. Many of whom who are probably like my lads school friends, die hard fans of clubs in cities they haven’t even visited. Just let the fans of either team celebrate/vent as appropriate. Let people enjoy the moment, not everything has to be a d*ck measuring contest. There is a shortage of joy in the world, so just back off and let fans enjoy themselves.",
      "So far this year I have been genuinely happy for Newcastle and Palace, whilst I know a couple of Geordies I know no Palace fans at all, but could appreciate the joy of both sets of fans at winning, after some lean years.",
      "I will join my lads to see the parade on Friday, and be back in my usual seat on Sunday. As grumpily as ever I will fork out the cost of my season ticket renewal at the latest possible moment.",
      "As I finished my last beer last night, I browsed your late night mailbox, and found myself totally overwhelmed. In amongst all the garbage mentioned above, there was a brief note from Garey Vance MUFC. Despite my not having written to this site in quite a long time, he name checked me, telling me to enjoy the celebrations.",

As a Newcastle fan who was at Wembley this season and simply didn’t know what it was like to feel pure* unbridled joy at winning something, I’ve really enjoyed watching Palace, Spurs (and even Bologna!) fans celebrate their team’s success, without the usual pained jealousy. People in stands crying, hugging, feeling emotions that haven’t experienced ever or in such a long time. It’s what football’s about.",
      "This is also real life sports fandom, not keyboard warriors or Twitter virgins banging on about what trophies matter, who is the real ‘big club’ and who has history.

      "It was also fantastic to see their fans and players celebrating and enjoying it so much. I watched the game with a lifelong Spurs fan, and there was a small group of other Spurs fans in the United dominated pub. It was great to see how delighted they were. Modern football has increasingly found a smaller and smaller pool of teams hoovering up all the pots. This season has been different and all the better for it. Palace winning the FA cup, Spurs winning last night. Even as a Liverpool fan I was able to enjoy the celebrations as Newcastle broke their trophy curse.",

Shaw being shaw (shit), manager frozen like deer in the headlights afraid to make a change (or do anything), the winning team doing actually nothing all game?",

      "Gareth Bale appeared to be amused at his own words; James Maddison looked like a sixth-former with a stick on beard; Sir Alex wobbled pitch-side like Young Mr Grace (ask yer grandad); Rio and Scholesy honked into the void for a while until everyone had lost the will to live.",
      "The flashbacks just rubbed salt into the open wounds, particularly as they illustrated just how far Manchester United had fallen. As soon as anyone attempts to describe footballers as potential match-winners, there is so much cognitive dissonance having actually seen them that it invalidates everything. At which point my 11 meg of broadband couldn’t take it anymore and snapped for an hour. I don’t expect I missed anything.",
      "When it came back they were still at it. Good God, make it stop. I felt sorry for the presenters who were forced to squeeze out the barfing for so long. Whose decision was it to do the five-hour show? And who do they answer to? I wonder what creative reason they invented to justify it? I watch football every day of every week and it was even too much for me and too low in quality.",
      "Eventually the football started. Commentary from Coisty and Fletch was a bit less energetic than usual; the game seemed to sap their enthusiasm. Both sides were lucky to be playing each other because if either was playing anyone half-decent, they’d have no chance. Still, poor sides can be fun to watch…I should know, I’ve spent my life doing it. At least there isn’t a massive resource imbalance.",

      "The pace was ridiculously frantic for the first half, as both sides competed to be the most useless, as error strewn and incapable as each other, proving the validity of their league positions. It could have been a mid-table fifth-tier match. Even the opening goal couldn’t have been more scrappy. I enjoyed the game because I love really poor-quality football. It’s amusing hearing them trying to excuse the clumsy play.",
      "Chappers says “it was awful” at half time. Hard to argue. Why did anyone think it wouldn’t be? United weren’t anywhere good enough. Spurs just did a Mourinho, less Angeball more Jose-ball. Fletch and Coisty just started talking amongst themselves because there was nothing going on. Spurs didn’t really have to do much really beyond one good save and booting it off the line.",
      "It stains the competition that two such poor sides made it to the final, illustrating the effect of grotesque financial inequalities. That they could both be so rotten but in a final should, but clearly won’t, invite UEFA soul-searching.",
      "Great that Ange won. I hope he sticks it up all his critics who’ve delighted in torturing him. And how heartwarming it was to see him hugging his wife and kids. No one knows the stress they’ve all suffered just for headlines. His post-game interview showed a man almost physically transformed by the weight off his shoulders. Gone was the brooding bear, back came the everyman.",
      "There were lots of pointless “how does it feel?” interviews. But it was clear this was the best outcome for TV; the redemption arc was irresistible.",
      "That they won with one shot on target (ish) and 29% possession shows how little Spurs had to do to beat a moribund United who will now delay and cock up sacking Amorim because of Ineos ineptitude, led by the Worzel Gummidge-style fool. A Bodo/Glimt v Lyon final would have definitely been better, if not as funny as two wealthy sides playing fifth-tier standard football."

      "Friday 23 May 2025 11:06, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim is not at risk of being sacked by Manchester United despite the Europa League final loss to Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Amorim's appointment at United has always, and continues, to be seen as a longer-term project and the club's commitment to the Portuguese head coach is not contingent on one game.",
      "Sources say he continues to have the full support of the club.",
      "Speaking immediately after the 1-0 loss to Spurs, Amorim had said he would leave United \"the next day\" for \"no compensation\" if the club's board and fans no longer wanted him.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" said the 40-year-old.",
      "\"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"",
      "Amorim took over at United in November with the club 13th in the table. They have slipped three places with Amorim knocked out of the three cup competitions in the process.",
      "Manchester United are now facing another summer rebuild under Amorim. Captain Bruno Fernandes, speaking moments after Amorim vowed not to quit, backed the United boss to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We just agreed that he's the right man,\" Fernandes said of his compatriot, who succeeded Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "\"He has done a lot of good things. We know that the manager is looked at by the results. Obviously we see more than that as players.",
      "\"We know for everyone it will be about him bringing back the positivity in the club, trying to bring the club back to fight for trophies, fight for the big trophies. And we all agree that he's the right man.\"",
      "Asked what he would have to say to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's decision-makers, the skipper said: \"It's not my decision, but I do think the manager is the right one.",
      "\"I don't think that it will be a better person to come into the job and to do the job. I know it's difficult to understand that, it's difficult to see that, but I still do think that he's the right man to lead the club.",

      "\"But as my other team-mates said, and I repeat myself, I do think he's the right man.\"",
      "Speaking after the final, a dejected Luke Shaw also claimed Amorim is the right man - with every single player needing to \"question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here\".",
      "\"We're all gutted, it's not how we saw the outcome to be honest,\" Shaw said. \"But it's not just tonight, this whole season, it's been nowhere near good enough. I think all of us have to question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here.",
      "\"For a team like Manchester [United], for the season we've had, it's not acceptable. We know that, we all know that, I know that. It's not where Manchester [United] should be.\"",

      "\"Ruben, for me, I talk on my behalf and I can talk on behalf of all the players, he is 100 per cent the right manager to take us back to where this club should be.",
      "\"It's going to be a very difficult process, us as players, we've let a lot of people down, including Ruben. I will say it again, we've been nowhere near good enough the whole season.\"",
      "Paul Merson says Amorim's comments regarding leaving Old Trafford without compensation have given Manchester United a potential route to parting ways with their head coach in future.",
      "\"I don't think Amorim really wants to be there,\" Merson said.",
      "\"When you turn around and say, 'I'd leave tomorrow without any compensation', that tells me he wants to be put out of his misery.",
      "\"Manchester United are also in a position now where, if they don't want him, they've had a result. He said he'll walk away without any compensation so they've now got a way out. They now won't have to pay fortunes to get rid of him.",
      "\"There's so much work to be done at Manchester United. Amorim saw all this coming. He didn't want to come until the end of the season. He knew there was a lot of work to be done and there's a lot more now.",
      "\"It's worrying times for Manchester United. I don't see them finishing in the top half of the table next season. To say that about Manchester United is mind-blowing. It's mind-blowing to think that I'd be shocked if they finished in the top half of the table next season.\""

      "When a player breaks the record for goal involvements in a 38-game Premier League season and fires his team to the title, it makes this category pretty routine. Step forward, Mo Salah.",
      "The Liverpool star has taken his game to new levels at the age of 32, posting career-best figures for assists to go with his huge haul of goals. Yes, Virgil van Dijk has been imperious at the back, yes, Alexander Isak and Declan Rice have shone for Newcastle and Arsenal respectively.",
      "But Salah has been involved in over 54 per cent of Liverpool's goals. Simply, they wouldn't have won the title without him.Peter Smith",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo needs an honourable mention here. Nottingham Forest were tipped by some for relegation, but he has led them to the European places. If the season ends in Champions League qualification, it would have been an incredible campaign for the Nottingham Forest boss.",
      "Eddie Howe is also a worthy candidate after leading Newcastle United to Carabao Cup glory and potentially the Champions League, but it's hard to look past Arne Slot.",
      "Many thought there'd be a drop off from Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp's exit, but testament to the job Slot has done at Anfield, there hasn't been.",
      "His first season in English football has ended in the title, which is an incredible achievement.Oliver Yew",
      "Nikola Milenkovic has had an incredible debut season for Forest. The £12m summer signing has been instrumental under Nuno and fans have marvelled at the brilliant partnership he's forged with fellow centre-back Murillo.",
      "Milenkovic ranks inside the top five for duel success both on the ground and in the air, mixing with likes of Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate.",
      "The 27-year-old Serbia international has also bagged four goals for Forest this season, just pipping Dean Huijsen who shone in his brief but fantastic spell at Bournemouth.Emilie Mwanza",
      "It became pretty obvious after Myles Lewis-Skelly's full Arsenal debut that he would go on to become something big.",
      "The teenage left-back's first Gunners start came in December but there was just something about him - his football arrogance, his ability to take the ball under pressure without fear or error and his consistency.",
      "Since then, he has become first-choice in that role and with England's left-back role at his feet too - a meteoric and unchallenged rise.",
      "And there is more to come - expect Lewis-Skelly to transition into midfield in the coming years.Sam Blitz",
      "Last season's top two, Man City and Arsenal, served up a pair of contrasting classics, starting with a bad-tempered, but intriguing four-goal classic at the Etihad in September that appeared to be going the visitors' way - that is, until John Stones's scrambled 98th-minute equaliser sent the home fans crazy, while breaking Gunners' hearts after almost holding on for the win since half-time with just 10 players.",
      "The return meeting at the Emirates in February may have lacked that tension, but the quality of Arsenal's five-star display that ripped the champions apart more than made up for it, with young left-back Myles Lewis-Skelly showing just why we selected him as our Young Player of the Year.",
      "However, our game of the season features the champions, although it is not their drama-filled 2-2 draw in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in February when James Tarkowski thundered home a 98th-minute equaliser that made the famous old ground shake.",
      "Rather it is Liverpool's visit to Newcastle United in early December that was this campaign's standout match and not just because it finished 3-3! The clash in the north east had all the ingredients that make up a classic, being played under the St James' Park lights, producing an electric atmosphere as a result, and plenty of goals, including a contender for strike of the season from Magpies forward Alexander Isak and then late drama when the hosts levelled matters.",
      "All in all, a real feast of football to showcase the brilliance of the Premier League.Rich Morgan",
      "\"The touch is as good as anything we will see in the Premier League this season. It's Messi-like.\"",
      "The touch to bring Bart Verbruggen's long punt downfield is sublime, the turn and change of direction to create space for the shot is sensational, and the whipped finish into the bottom corner rounded off a special Premier League moment.Oliver Yew",
      "Matz Sels and David Raya have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League goalkeeper this season, so it should be of no surprise to see their names featuring heavily in this category.",
      "In fact, Sels' player-of-the-match performance to prevent Liverpool from taking all three points at Nottingham Forest in January features several world-class stops that all came under consideration.",
      "There were several other saves that caught the eye during the season, such as Emi Martinez displaying ridiculous reactions to prevent Chris Wood's header from crossing the line at the City Ground in December, Andre Onana diving full length to deny Crystal Palace's Ismaila Sarr and Alphonse Areola somehow keeping out Mohamed Salah's close-range strike at the London Stadium before Christmas.",
      "However, the nod goes to the aforementioned Raya, who helped Arsenal inflict on Aston Villa their only home loss in the league this season with a simply ridiculous second-half stop to keep out Ollie Watkins' header.",
      "The Arsenal No 1 first had to touch Amadou Onana's deflected shot on to the bar, before immediately springing back up to his feet and pushing away to safety the England striker's point-blank header, with Gary Neville exclaiming on commentary: \"How Raya reacts, wow!\"Rich Morgan",
      "A moment that will live forever in history. James Tarkowski crashing in a 98th-minute equaliser in the final Merseyside derby at Goodison Park. Forty-one wins apiece for Everton and Liverpool at the Grand Old Lady. Forever. Hit play on our video above and drink in those extraordinary scenes again...Peter Smith",
      "Too many to choose from. The Man Utd head coach has been relegation-level on the pitch, but Quadruple-winning in the press conference room.",
      "\"We're maybe the worst team in the history of Man Utd,\" wins it though. That came in January after a loss to Brighton. Nobody actually expected him to follow through with it though…Sam Blitz",
      "A season of profit has been secured for the fifth season running with the best bets advised in the column leading to +18.7. It's been a bumpy ride involving near misses and losing runs but the winners have flowed nicely. A spell of betting against Manchester City at short prices before it was trendy to do so made me look very clever indeed, correctly calling wins for Tottenham (0-4), Bournemouth (2-1) and Brighton (2-1) during City's mid-season wobble was a memorable spell.",
      "There have been longshot treble wins at 10/1 and 14/1 - a particular highlight was Joelinton's card for Newcastle at Aston Villa copping the treble after Brentford beat Brighton and Palace and Bournemouth sailed under the 2.5 goals line in a 0-0 draw.",
      "And we've finished the season strongly, nailing a lovely 10/1 winning angle on 32+ fouls being committed in the Europa League final.Lewis Jones",
      "Learning to accept being wrong is a key part of keeping a sane headspace when it comes to making betting decisions and putting your neck on the line. And I've had plenty of practice this season.",
      "Let's start with Tottenham to finish in the top four and Dominic Solanke to score 20 or more goals shall we at 12/1? Or what about Leif Davis - the Ipswich assist-king of a full back - who I was excited about in the top assist markets in pre-season at 100/1? Just one assist was it Leif? Ah well.",
      "In fact, my reading for most of the season on the newly-promoted teams was downright ugly. Thinking Leicester were a \"barnstorming price\" to beat Everton at Goodison Park at 7/2 quickly went down the drain after just 10 seconds when Abdoulaye Doucoure sent the hosts on their way to the most comfortable 4-0 win you're ever likely to see.Lewis Jones"

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Friday 23 May 2025 06:07, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."

      "The 30-year-old midfielder has been a rare shining light in a dreadful season at Old Trafford, but even his star was dimmed in Wednesday's 1-0 defeat by fellow Premier League strugglers Spurs in Bilbao.",
      "Fernandes has recently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal, leading head coach Ruben Amorim to stress United should try to keep \"one of the top players in the world\".",
      "But the Europa League final reverse has financial ramifications as it means they miss out on Champions League qualification, with the lack of European football raising fresh questions over the skipper's future.",
      "\"I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go,\" Fernandes said. \"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to great days.",
      "\"In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was non-committal over his Man Utd future after expressing annoyance at being named on the bench for the Europa League final.",
      "The 20-year-old has been linked with a move away from United this season, with Napoli and Chelsea expressing interest in signing the Argentina international during the winter transfer window.",
      "That speculation will only intensity after Garnacho - like his brother Roberto on Instagram - expressed frustration at not starting on Wednesday.",
      "The academy graduate had started every knockout match in the run to the final and eventually replaced Mason Mount in the 71st minute at San Mames.",
      "\"Obviously it's hard for everyone,\" Garnacho told Argentinian media after the final.",
      "\"Our season was ****. We didn't beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things. When you don't score goals, you always need more.",
      "\"Until we reached the final, I played every round. I played 20 minutes today... I don't know.",
      "\"I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "Fernandes joined United from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 and has just won the club's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for the fourth time - a joint record with Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea.",
      "The Portugal international's future is one of numerous issues facing United as they enter a summer rebuild under Amorim, whose side sit 16th in the Premier League and have now fallen at the final hurdle in Europe.",
      "\"We just agreed that he's the right man,\" Fernandes said as he backed his compatriot, who succeeded Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "\"He has done a lot of good things. We know that the manager is looked at by the results. Obviously we see more than that as players.",
      "\"We know for everyone it will be about him bringing back the positivity in the club, trying to bring the club back to fight for trophies, fight for the big trophies. And we all agree that he's the right man.\"",
      "Fernandes was speaking moments after Amorim vowed not to quit but admitted he would walk away without compensation if United's board and fans wanted him to.",
      "Asked what he would have to say to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's decision-makers, the skipper said: \"It's not my decision, but I do think the manager is the right one.",
      "\"I don't think that it will be a better person to come into the job and to do the job. I know it's difficult to understand that, it's difficult to see that, but I still do think that he's the right man to lead the club.",
      "\"I do think that obviously the club is in a situation where it's easier to get a different one in because the results haven't been there.",
      "\"But as my other team-mates said, and I repeat myself, I do think he's the right man.\""

      "Wednesday 21 May 2025 23:42, UK",
      "Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half goal fired Tottenham to their first trophy in 17 years with a 1-0 Europa League final win over Manchester United.",
      "It was a game - and goal - that was befitting of a clash between the Premier League's 16th and 17th-placed teams, but it was Spurs who finally ended their silverware drought, winning their first title since 2008.",
      "Ange Postecoglou's claim earlier in the campaign that he always wins trophies in his second season has been vindicated. Whether it is enough for him to remain as Spurs manager remains to be seen but the club will be playing in the Champions League next season.",
      "There was a touch of confusion around the goal. Pape Sarr sent in a good cross, with Johnson and Luke Shaw charging for it. The ball pinged between the two before coming off Shaw's arm, sending it goalwards.",
      "The Spurs forward got the lightest of final touches at the near post, sending the sea of white shirts inside the San Mames into raptures.",
      "Brennan Johnson’s goal was Tottenham's first stike in a cup final in five attempts.\n\n\nThey failed to score in the 2009, 2015 and 2021 Carabao Cup finals, plus the 2019 Champions League final.",
      "Man Utd dominated the second half as they searched for an equaliser - and they had three gilt-edged chances after the hour.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' floated free-kick met Leny Yoro's outstretched foot but a leaping Guglielmo Vicario kept him out. The Spurs goalkeeper was then saved by Micky van de Ven as the defender acrobatically cleared Rasmus Hojlund's header off the line.",
      "Fernandes - who has bailed his team out on more than one occasion this season - fizzed a free header past the post. In seven minutes of added time, Vicario made a match-winning save to keep out Shaw's header.",
      "Casemiro then fired into the side netting as Man Utd ran out of ideas in Bilbao. It means they will have no European football next season and their summer transfers will likely be impacted as a result.",
      "But the night belonged to Tottenham, who lifted their first European trophy since 1984 and beat Man Utd for a fourth time this year.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur manager Ange Postecoglou:",

      "\"I'm not afraid to declare that, if I fell short then I was happy to cop it. That was my ambition. I could say that. I was prepared to wear it. People kept reminding me of it but that was only because there was an opportunity to win something.",
      "\"It's how the club perceives itself. People are quick to take shots at the club who haven't defended themselves as much as it should. I understand that as people have been here a long time and haven't had anything to lean on. I'm hoping this does.",
      "\"There's no reason why they can't go into next year believing they can win again and building a team that strives to win things. If you see yourself in that way, irrespective of what the noise is, that's what the great clubs do. They expect success as they've had it. Hopefully this takes the club forward.",
      "\"I've had such a laser focus on winning this. Whatever happens, happens. We're still building this team. It's a young team, we need to add experience. My thought process has been about building a team that can be successful for five or six years.",
      "\"But I'm the manager - that decision is not in my hands. It doesn't affect me. You would have seen that in the build-up, all I care about is [the medal] - as this means this football club has won a trophy.",

      "Tottenham beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Europa League final thanks to Brennan Johnson's winner; Cristian Romero was a rock at the back for Ange Postecoglou's side while Micky van de Ven saved Spurs in second half; Bruno Fernandes, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund had nights to forget",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 01:18, UK",
      "Tottenham are Europa League champions, ending their 17-year wait for a trophy by beating Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson's winner late in the first half was enough for the north Londoners to book a spot in the Champions League next season - and increased the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, who will be subjected to their lowest-ever Premier League finish and nothing more.",
      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",
      "That clearance. That athleticism. The Dutchman was just as solid as Romero but his acrobatic heroics to deny Hojlund that leveller will be remembered just as much as Johnson's goal. What a way to make yourself a hero.",
      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",
      "Like Bissouma, a good water carrier, doing a lot of the dirty work without being spectacular. All three of Spurs' midfielders kept Bruno Fernandes very quiet, giving the Manchester United danger man next to no space.",
      "Superb cross for Spurs' opener - exactly what was needed after his side lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury for this big game. Did not hold the ball well enough but that did not really matter in the end. It was not punished.",
      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",
      "Actually, you could see why the Spurs captain did not start. He came on and even then he struggled, being beaten in a race by Patrick Dorgu despite playing an hour less football than his counterpart. Has he lost his legs?",
      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"
