      "Phil Foden and Erling Haaland were once again Manchester United's tormentors-in-chief as Manchester City cruised to a 3-0 win over their bitter rivals in the derby.",
      "After a poignant - and exemplary - tribute from fans in both blue and red to boxing great Ricky Hatton following his sad death earlier in the day, City flew out of the blocks and almost took the lead inside 60 seconds when Haaland sent a strike narrowly wide of Altay Bayindir's post. The United keeper stood no chance, though, when Foden ghosted into the box to plant a header inside his far post 18 minutes in.",
      "Foden and Haaland have both been prolific in recent derbies and it came as no surprise when the latter got in on the act shortly after the break following neat work from Nico O'Reilly, Foden and Jeremy Doku. The dazzling Doku grabbed his second assist of the afternoon by feeding City's imperious No 9, who made no mistake with a neat dink over Bayindir.",
      "And it was Haaland who put the game to bed in the 68th minute when, after being played clean through with a run which started from his own half, he clinically threaded the ball into the bottom corner for his second goal.",
      "On a week where Pep Guardiola unofficially coronated Haaland as the world's best striker amid suggestions from Arne Slot that Liverpool new boy Alexander Isak was, perhaps, top of the pops, Manchester City's goal machine emphatically proved his manager's point.",
      "For a striker with such a phenomenal goal record since arriving in the Premier League, there's also been plenty of talk about his lack of involvement in games. But he had plenty of touches here (31 for anyone counting) and was just as influential in his own penalty area before dispatching two textbook finishes to consign United to a derby defeat, with his six clearances the best defensive contribution of anybody in a blue shirt.",
      "With eight goals in nine games against City's bitter rivals it's no wonder Guardiola says he wouldn't change Haaland for anyone. On this showing, would anyone?",
      "For someone who needed a fast start to the new Premier League campaign, Ruben Amorim has overseen just one win from Manchester United's first four games.",
      "The Portuguese coach will be given time to get things right after United spent big on a new attack in the summer but this was not a derby day performance which will live long in the memory and few left an impression in their rivals' backyard.",
      "United may have spurned a flurry of good opportunities in the final 15 minutes to bump their stats, but the game was already done as a contest. And more concerningly, they were shoddy in defence and midfield still looks an area of concern.",
      "Per Opta, this is now United's worst start to a league season since they also mustered four points from their opening four games back in the 1992-93 campaign. And after spending more than £200m this summer, it feels like we still have more questions than answers when it comes to Amorim and this Manchester United team.",
      "Foden has made a habit of scoring in Manchester derbies. But his seventh in as many fixtures could be his most important yet if it turns out to be the start of a renaissance for the influential attacking midfielder, who has not hit top form for club or country for quite some time. The fact that his goal here was his first since January tells the story.",
      "A return to form would be most welcome for Guardiola, who has seen his all-conquering team turn mortal before his eyes over the last 12 months. Following Kevin de Bruyne's removal from the City throne this summer, the previously formidable former champions have a vacancy for a new kingpin. Foden, though always influential in his own right, had long been touted as De Bruyne's natural successor. He and City will hope Sunday's latest derby moment will turn out to be the prelude to that.",
      "The talk in the build-up of this was largely over who would start in goal for both teams. And while Gianluigi Donnarumma and Altay Bayindir got the nod between the sticks, only one is likely to stay there.",
      "Donnarumma is widely regarded as one of the world's best keepers and arrives at The Etihad off the back of conquering Europe with Paris Saint-Germain. He is elite right now - as he showed with his fine save to thwart Bryan Mbeumo in the second half - whereas Bayindir was signed two years ago primarily as a deputy.",
      "Senne Lammens, United's newly acquired keeper, is seen as a player capable of growing into the club's next No 1. Amorim decided against handing the highly-rated 23-year-old Belgium prospect a baptism of fire in the derby despite the fact Bayindir has never really convinced when playing in place of the erratic Andre Onana. But like Donnarumma for City, Lammens will be drafted in as United's new No 1 sooner rather than later.",
      "On an afternoon where City's attackers dazzled, two thirds of United's new-look frontline were forced to feed off scraps until the dying embers of the game. While we've seen little of Benjamin Sesko since his big-money arrival, Bryan Mbeumo - and the injured Matheus Cunha - have already shown enough in glimpses that they can improve United's record in front of goal and the Cameroon star was unfortunate not to find the net with a fine volley on the hour.",
      "Sesko's first Premier League start went by without the striker having any real chance of note as United struggled to fashion much in the way of clear-cut opportunities until City were 3-0 up and in cruise control. United may have seen enough in recent games to suggest their new-look attack will click, but it didn't quite fire on derby day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "This fan, who was pulling pints behind the bar at the Etihad, unzipped his jacket to reveal a United shirt, much to the annoyance of the City fans he was serving.",

      "It read: \"Thank you for making us aware of this. We can confirm that this individual has now been removed from their position.",
      "\"Scenes when united win and hire him,\" one fan joked. Another chimed in: \"Make this the 118th charge..\"",
      "City supporters had another reason to cheer during the first half, as local hero Phil Foden netted a goal to put Pep Guardiola's team in the lead. It was a poignant day for Foden, following the tragic passing of Ricky Hatton.",
      "\"Today is for him and we're going to try and get the win and do the best for him.\"",

      "Manchester United icon Roy Keane tore into Luke Shaw and Bruno Fernandes for their roles in Phil Foden's opening strike in the Manchester Derby.",
      "The Manchester City star nodded home midway through the first-half to give his side the lead. And Keane was far from pleased with the contributions from two United stars in particular.",
      "Fernandes had allowed goalscorer Foden to ghost into the box undetected, while Shaw failed to deal with Jeremy Doku - the Belgian wideman producing the cross from which City scored their opener.",
      "\"It's a nice bit of skill, but Shaw's an England international player. He's got hundreds of games under his belt, he doesn't even get his body position right.",
      "\"It's like he has thrown the towel in. We know people can run off the back of Bruno, that's been going on for years. But my goodness, even before that, you've got two midfielders - they are too square. One pass takes them out. Far too easy. Shaw just throws the towel in there.\"",
      "Ex-City star Micah Richards also shared his thoughts and was far from convinced with both Shaw and Fernandes' attempts at defending.",
      "He added: \"I just want to look at Fernandes' position here, though. He's playing in that two in midfield and once the ball is over at that side, now you have got to read the danger and he just loses Foden there. Just switches off and it wasn't good enough.\"",
      "Things got worse for City shortly after the break, with Erling Haaland doubling the lead. Doku was once again the man at the heart of things as he rolled the Norwegian through, while the City forward lifted a brilliant finish into the net for his fourth goal of the season.",
      "Doku should have had a hat-trick of assists minutes later after playing Haaland through again but somehow Haaland hit the base of the post having gone around Altay Bayindir.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson is no stranger to holding private talks with either Pep Guardiola or Ruben Amorim. Guardiola's Manchester City host rivals Manchester United, managed by Amorim, in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Despite both clubs enjoying vast Premier League success in the past, neither side has started the season well. City, despite their hopes that last term was merely a blip, are down in 16th, having won one and lost two games so far.",
      "Less surprisingly, given United's decline since Ferguson's departure in 2013 and a woeful 15th-place finish last season, Amorim's Red Devils are in 11th place. And it is entirely possible that the Portuguese head coach may have leaned on Sir Alex for some advice ahead of the short trip to the Etihad Stadium.",
      "That's because Amorim revealed last season in January, midway through United's turbulent campaign, that he was in regular contact with the 83-year-old. Allowing Amorim to tap into his vast knowledge suggests that Ferguson has a reasonably close relationship with Amorim and wants to help the young head coach.",
      "\"I speak with Sir Alex several times. I try to call him to keep being positive,\" Amorim told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's really good because I feel the history of the club but it's really hard, as they did such a good job, to be the guy leading the team at this moment. It's really hard but we have to believe.\"",
      "In the opposition dugout on Sunday will be a man whom Ferguson will also know well. The Scot had formerly handpicked David Moyes as his successor, only for his compatriot to be sacked less than a year into the United job in 2014.",
      "Ryan Giggs took charge on an interim basis before Louis van Gaal was eventually appointed. But before the Dutchman's arrival, Ferguson had sought to make amends by apparently trying to snap up Guardiola - then at Bayern Munich, and regarded as the best manager in the world.",
      "Guardiola, who ironically joined City in 2016 and has won six Premier League titles since, recalled once being invited to a private meeting by Ferguson, where he was left unsure of whether the Scotsman was offering him the United job or not.",
      "\"He invited me to [a] super restaurant and we had a very, very good time. My English [was] not so good when Sir Alex [Ferguson] spoke a little bit quickly, I had sometimes had a problem understanding him,\" explained Guardiola.",
      "\"That's why I didn't understand if I received an offer or not. It was a friendly dinner, like always with me when I started as a coach, he was so, so gentle and we spent a very, very good time together.\"",
      "Ferguson's record in Manchester derbies is 26 wins, 10 draws, and 11 losses. Guardiola, meanwhile, has won eight of his 15 league clashes with the Red Devils but lost both times he faced Amorim last year. One loss came against Amorim's Sporting CP side in the Champions League and then to United in December.",

      "Manchester United fans have been left feeling that the club is 'cursed' after Rasmus Hojlund took less than a quarter of an hour to score on his debut for Napoli. Hojlund, 22, joined the Italian champions on a season-long loan in the final knockings of the summer transfer window, having been pushed down the pecking order at Old Trafford.",
      "The Danish striker wasn't included in any of Ruben Amorim's squads for the four matches before his departure on deadline day, with new signing Benjamin Sesko preferred. United agreed a fee of up to £73.7million for Slovenia international Sesko and Amorim was happy to have him and Joshua Zirkzee as his options up front.",
      "Napoli needed a replacement for ex-Red Devils striker Romelu Lukaku, who suffered a thigh injury in pre-season and is set to spend the next two to three months on the sidelines. The Serie A title winners have paid a £5m loan fee and will be obligated to sign Hojlund permanently if they qualify for the Champions League, with a £38m deal already in place.",
      "The United loanee previously played in Italy for Atalanta, where he convinced the Red Devils to fork out an initial £64m for his signature two years ago. Hojlund bagged his first goal of the season as a substitute in Denmark's 3-0 victory over Greece during the international break.",
      "He took his shooting boots back to Napoli and netted with just 14 minutes on the clock in Saturday's trip to Fiorentina, making it 2-0. Antonio Conte's side ran out 3-1 winners, with former Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne also getting on the scoresheet.",
      "Although he'd scored in Champions League games, United fans had to wait a painstaking 1,027 minutes for Hojlund to finally notch his first Premier League goal on Boxing Day 2023. So it was no surprise that the Old Trafford faithful reacted strongly to the Denmark international's early goal for Napoli.",
      "\"Debut goal, Utd are cursed,\" one fan said. A second lamented: \"Hojlund scores on his debut? Wow we're cursed.\" A third bemoaned: \"We're really cursed.\" Another asked: \"So the problem is Manchester United?\"",
      "Post-match, Conte hailed his new striker, joking that Napoli signed Hojlund because Scott McTominay was a success after coming from Old Trafford last season. \"Hojlund is only 22 years old, we got him from Manchester United, seeing as it brought us luck doing that with McTominay,\" the Napoli boss told Sky Sport Italia.",
      "\"We knew his qualities; he has great potential and can improve. You can see he's a lad with great prospects.\"",

      "Gary Neville famously refused to shake hands with Peter Schmeichel during the 2002 Manchester derby. The pair had formed a close bond during Schmeichel's eight-year tenure at Old Trafford in the 1990s.",
      "However, Schmeichel's decision to join City in 2002 after successful stints with Sporting CP and Aston Villa was seen as a betrayal by many United fans. The move also particularly irked Neville due to the intense rivalry between the two Manchester clubs.",
      "An awkward moment ensued during the Manchester derby in November, 23 years ago, when both teams were lining up in the tunnel at Maine Road. Schmeichel, leading out City, offered his hand to Neville, who was standing in as United's captain, but the full-back remained silent, briefly locking eyes with Schmeichel before brushing his hand aside.",
      "Neville then stood firm, a stern expression on his face, before leading his team onto the pitch to face their fierce rivals. Reflecting on the incident in 2018, Neville defended his decision to snub Schmeichel. During an appearance on the Quickly Kevin, Will He Score? podcast, he explained: \"When you look back now and you're 43, like I am, there are two things about that.",
      "\"One, he left Man United at the age of whatever he was, 35, and he said he was retiring, basically to go abroad. At the time when he came back, he played for Manchester City. You can't play for Manchester City. I'm a United fan and I can't play for Manchester City, I can't play for Leeds and I can't play for Liverpool. That's just written in stone.",
      "\"You just don't play for those clubs, irrespective of what happens. He'd won the treble with United in '99, said that he was retiring... he should have carried on playing for United for the next two or three years if that was the case. We struggled for a keeper between Peter and Edwin [van der Sar].",
      "\"The other thing was at that time I hated everybody, we all did. Everybody hated us, we all hated everybody. That's the way it was. With Sir Alex [Ferguson], you're on an island and we were [in a] siege mentality. If you're not on the island, do one.\"",
      "Neville also revealed he maintained a strict policy of refusing to shake hands with opposing players before kick-off, regardless of their identity or allegiance. He added: \"Shake hands at the end of the game when you've had the battle. I just think, I'm focusing before a game.",
      "\"I'm focusing on my first pass, which wasn't always a good one, my first touch, my first tackle, my opponent and how I'm going to affect him in the first five minutes of that game. I can't let him go past me on my first one-on-one - that's impossible - because if he goes past me the first time he's going to get confidence.",
      "\"I'm also going to run off him going forward to make him think he's got to run back. The first time the ball is in the air, I'm going to win that header. All I'm thinking about before that game is that. The idea of talking to a player from the opposition - that would distract me.",
      "\"So you say about not shaking hands with Peter Schmeichel, but I didn't shake hands with my brother [Phil Neville] when he was captain of Everton. And that's not because I don't like my brother - I do like him, he's all right.\"",
      "During that memorable Manchester derby, City thrashed United 3-1 at home, with Shaun Goater netting twice and Nicolas Anelka also on target to overshadow Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's consolation goal. The revelation comes ahead of Sunday's clash between the Manchester rivals at the Etihad Stadium, more than two decades after Neville's confrontation with Schmeichel.",
      "Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are desperate to find their footing at home after a mixed start to the season, with a victory over Wolves but defeats to Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton. The Citizens are keen to get back on track in one of the most high-stakes games of the season.",
      "Meanwhile, United have had a varied start to the season, with a loss, a draw and a win against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley respectively. Manager Ruben Amorim is under pressure to deliver this season, having received full support from the board this summer, following a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League last term.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The first Manchester derby of the season is upon us, and it is shaping up to be a crucial clash for both Manchester City and Manchester United. The two titans will lock horns at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday at 4.30pm.",
      "It's the prime slot for the biggest Premier League game of the weekend, but there's more than just three points at stake. As with every derby, local bragging rights are up for grabs. The victorious fans will claim Manchester as either blue or red until the return fixture at Old Trafford on January 26, 2026.",
      "However, this time around, the stakes seem higher. Both teams currently languish in the bottom half of the table.",
      "It is surprising to see City in 16th place, even after only three games. Pep Guardiola's men have suffered back-to-back defeats against Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton & Hove Albion, following an opening-day victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "United, on the other hand, sit in 11th position. Ruben Amorim's side have had a mixed start to the season, winning one, drawing one, and losing one of their first three matches, requiring a late Bruno Fernandes penalty to secure all three points against newly promoted Burnley last time out.",
      "United's Carabao Cup journey was cut short last month, following a penalty shootout defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town. In the wake of that match, United boss Amorim seemed to doubt his future at the club.",
      "However, their victory over Burnley silenced the speculation for a while. Losing to rivals Man City, though, could reignite those rumours.",
      "United hope to carry forward the momentum they built up before the international break into the upcoming game. A win would give City the boost they need to kick off their season.",
      "United's next challenge is Chelsea at Old Trafford on Saturday. While they have nearly a week to prepare, City face Napoli in their opening Champions League match on Thursday.",
      "City will undoubtedly aim for a positive result against their rivals to set them up nicely for the challenging fixture. Meanwhile, United will appreciate the extra preparation time before their next match, and no one wants to arrive at Carrington this week with the pressure to make amends.",
      "Given it's still early days in the season, securing three points could significantly alter the table standings. A win for United would bring them level with Everton and Sunderland, who currently sit in sixth and seventh place, respectively.",
      "A victory for City would catapult them into the top half of the table, two points clear of their city rivals - a much-needed morale boost following the disappointment of their last two matches. However, defeat could spell disaster, solidifying a sluggish start to the Premier League season.",
      "City learned the hard way last season; escaping a rut can be daunting. Their poor form almost ended their chances of securing a spot in the Champions League.",
      "A loss against United this weekend could effectively knock them out of the title race with Liverpool and Arsenal, despite the season being in its infancy. United find themselves in a similar predicament; defeat could resurrect the doubts that haunted last season, dampening morale both on and off the pitch and potentially jeopardising their European ambitions.",
      "The significance of the Manchester derby is never to be underestimated, but Sunday's match may carry more weight than previous encounters and those yet to come. It already feels like a do-or-die situation for both teams, a sentiment rarely felt this early in the campaign.",

      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has admitted midfielder Carlos Baleba has been \"affected by the noise\" around his failed move to Manchester United.",
      "Baleba was strongly linked with a move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window and became one of United's top targets as Ruben Amorim sought a new No 6 to play alongside Bruno Fernandes in midfield.",
      "But United were put off by Brighton's reported valuation of £115million and moved onto other targets - though they were ultimately unable to bring in the defensive midfield player they wanted.",
      "Hurzeler insisted he was confident Baleba would not be sold and his prediction came true, but not without consequences. The 21-year-old was benched for his side's 2-1 loss to Bournemouth on Saturday and instead came off the bench.",
      "The German coach said Baleba had been affected mentally by the speculation surrounding a move to United, saying \"sometimes young players don't have the face we want to see\".",
      "\"I think it’s normal for a young player when the media creates the noise around him,\" the Brighton boss said.",
      "\"It’s not easy for this player to handle it. Therefore we need to give him the time and support so he comes back to his best performance.",
      "\"But he’s a young player and I think that’s something we have to accept, that young players don’t always have the face we want to see. ‘It’s our responsibility to help them in the right moments.",
      "\"I think everyone gets affected, especially when you are that young and you hear these kinds of things, no matter if they are wrong or right. But it’s just noise we don’t need.\"",
      "Hurzeler was speaking after his Brighton side's defeat to the Cherries, in which Baleba played the final 24 minutes.",
      "It was the first time Baleba has not started a game in the Premier League this season. He's played a total of 200 minutes in the top flight in 2025-26 so far and has been a key player for the Seagulls since his arrival in 2023.",
      "He's played 82 times for the club, scoring four goals, becoming the latest successful midfield signing to star for Brighton after Yves Bissouma, Moises Caicedo and Alexis Mac Allister.",

      "Andy Dunn is the Mirror's chief sports writer.",
      "Despite the hullabaloo that has accompanied Manchester United’s modern-day struggles, it should be no surprise if the derby goes their way at the Etihad today. After all, Pep Guardiola has managed to win only four of his nine Premier League home fixtures against United. Pep has lost four of those games, with one drawn.",
      "As City manager, his overall record against United - who have had five different, official managers during Guardiola’s Etihad tenure (if you count Ralf Rangnick’s six-month spell as official) - is good.",
      "But, in the context of City’s all-conquering era, it is not startling. In all competitions, City have faced United 25 times since Guardiola took over in the summer of 2016 and have lost nine of those matches, winning 13 and playing out three goalless draws.",
      "Only against Liverpool and Spurs have Guardiola’s City suffered more defeats (10). And Guardiola’s record against Ruben Amorim is underwhelming, having won only one of their five meetings, drawing two and losing two.",
      "Both United and City have made unconvincing starts to the season, Amorim’s team a point ahead of their local rivals. United have created plenty of chances but still look limited in the goalscoring department while City’s defensive vulnerability - which emerged quite emphatically last season - remains there for all to see and exploit.",
      "So, while bookmakers have City as favourites for the latest edition of the Manchester derby, it is a very tough one to call. And also, it would probably be unwise to read too much into the outcome.",
      "After all, despite United’s good record at the Etihad in the Guardiola years, City have won six Premier League titles in that timespan. Getting a home beating at the hands of United has rarely knocked City out of their successful stride.",
      "But a win for United in this latest encounter WOULD carry extra significance. By any means, it has not been a spectacular start to the current campaign but given he joined when a grim season was already well underway, this feels like the real beginning of the Amorim regime.",
      "The departure of Andre Onana, who has gone on loan to Trabzonspor, is starkly symbolic as the goalkeeper was one of the previous regime’s flagship signings. In contrast, for all the transfer business done by City in this year’s two transfer windows, perhaps the most significant move in or out of the Etihad in 2025 was the departure of Kevin de Bruyne.",
      "He was a flagship player of the entire Guardiola-City era. And of all the incomings, it is still hard to pinpoint one as a certainty to follow in the influential footsteps of serial winners such as De Bruyne.",
      "It still takes a huge leap of imagination to see this season marking the decline of Pep’s Premier League powers and the emergence of Amorim’s excellence. But another United victory at the Etihad would certainly bring that scenario an unlikely step closer.",

      "Owen Hargreaves was as classy as ever in his response to Sir Alex Ferguson branding him as one of the worst signings of his career. It was in 2007 when Manchester United signed the ex-England star from Bayern Munich for a reported fee of £17million.",
      "Arriving in England with four Bundesliga titles and a Champions League triumph to his name, Hargreaves possessed quite the pedigree while being voted England's best player at the 2006 World Cup a year prior.",
      "It was instant success for the midfielder at Old Trafford as he won the Premier League and Champions League double in his first season, making 34 appearances across all competitions.",
      "Unfortunately, that would turn out to be the last full season of Hargreaves' career as a recurring patellar tendinitis problem would effectively end his time in football. Despite numerous operations on both of his knees, it would do little for a hopeful return to the pitch.",
      "Hargreaves made just five more appearances in his next three seasons at United before he was released in 2011 as he went on to sign for Manchester City for one season. In his only campaign for City, he played four times and retired from football after his release from the Citizens.",
      "It was in Ferguson's autobiography that he revealed his regret in signing Hargreaves, claiming his former player had no self-belief. \"We started to put together a bid for him. But I studied his playing record and felt a tinge of doubt. I didn't feel a strong vibe about him. David Gill worked hard on the deal with Bayern,\" the Scotsman wrote.",
      "\"I met Owen's agent at the World Cup final in Berlin. Nice man, a lawyer. I told him we could develop Hargreaves at United. It turned out to be a disaster. Owen had no confidence in himself whatsoever.",
      "\"He didn't show nearly enough determination to overcome his physical difficulties, for my liking. I saw him opt for the easy choice too often in terms of training. He was one of the most disappointing signings of my career.\"",
      "Despite the harsh words from his former manager, Hargreaves was class personified when given the opportunity to respond, instead insisting a private conversation would be required rather than taking to airwaves.",
      "\"It's a complicated one. Anyone who knows me knows that professionalism is one of my strongest traits. A lot of people were surprised by what he said, me included. He said a lot of things in there that were with emotion,\" Hargreaves told BT Sport.",
      "\"The reason he brought me over was to win the Champions League and we were able to do that and I played a big part. After the treatment that I had that summer I virtually never played again. For a young player, I was only 27, be at that point in my career and never play again, to have to deal with all of that was very, very difficult.",
      "\"I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. A lot of relationships break down due to communication. My only regret is that I didn't go to him sooner. But I didn't realise the severity of the situation until it was a little bit too late. The reason I left Bayern was to play for United, it was a privilege to play there.",
      "\"It was an honour to play under him. For it to deteriorate like it did was very disappointing. I think it's a conversation me and him need to have personally. I wouldn't wish that situation on anyone.\"",
      "Hargreaves' two former sides are set to clash on Sunday in the first Manchester derby of the season at the Etihad Stadium. Both clubs have had a dire start to the season, with City suffering consecutive defeats. United's only victory has come at home to Burnley, courtesy of a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes penalty.",

      "After a chance to reset during the international break, City and United are ready to clash at the Etihad. Last season's version of this fixture saw United snatch a 2-1 win in the dying embers, compounding a miserable run of form for City.",
      "The hero of that night, Amad, has been short of minutes in the Premier League this term, but due to Diogo Dalot, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount all being ruled out through injury, he's set to be involved from the start. Their spate of injuries could also see Benjamin Sesko make his first league start since joining from RB Leipzig for a cool £73.7million.",
      "One new signing who won't be starting is Senne Lammens, as Amorim confirmed in his pre-match press conference that Altay Bayindir would keep his place. \"Altay is going to continue because it's a different league (for Lammens), it's a different country, trainings, ball, so we try to maintain that and they will fight for the position,\" the Red Devils boss explained.",
      "\"So, for me, it's clear, Altay will start. We believe in our goalkeepers, I believe in Altay, he's ready to play and he's going to play.\"",
      "While Amorim has already made a decision on his goalkeeper, Guardiola must decide whether he hands a debut to Gianluigi Donnarumma, who like Lammens arrived on transfer deadline day. James Trafford, a fellow summer signing, received mixed reviews after his three games between the posts and faces a battle to keep the gloves.",
      "When asked about about Donnarumma, Guardiola replied: \"He is so tall, he is so huge. [From] all the keepers we want is safe balls, give confidence to the team, have personality and a big presence.",
      "Who'll win the Manchester derby? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"In the biggest stages in the Champions League last season, at Villa Park, Anfield and in many games, he proved how good he is. He is going to concede goals, that is for sure, but all of us, we are going to try to handle it.\"",
      "On Trafford, the City manager said: \"He is a keeper for Man City. I can only play one keeper, I can play two full-backs, two centre-backs. The season is so long everyone will be involved. They may not believe it but they will.\"",
      "Following the closure of the summer transfer window, United are down to just four academy graduates in their Premier League squad. The Red Devils have had someone from their academy in every first-team matchday squad since 1937, a record that Amorim doesn't want to be responsible for ending.",
      "\"We want to maintain it - I don't want to be the guy that broke that record or that idea,\" Amorim admitted. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future so I will try to maintain that, that is for sure.\"",

      "Nicky Butt believes Marcus Rashford's \"ship has sailed\" at Manchester United, claiming that bigger players have left the club before him. Rashford, 27, secured a season-long loan move to Barcelona this summer after being considered surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward fell from grace under the Portuguese tactician shortly after his arrival last November, moving to Aston Villa on loan in February. Upon his return this summer, Rashford appeared to have no prospects at Old Trafford and consequently moved to Barcelona on loan with an option for a £20million permanent transfer.",
      "Numerous supporters will question whether the Red Devils' academy product will return to his childhood club, but Butt believes he has no role with United moving forward. Speaking to the MEN via BetMGM, the 50-year-old said: \"Yeah, I think that ship's sailed.",
      "\"I think over the last two or three seasons he's shown that he needs to move football clubs, and I think that comes. A lot of things have been said about certain behaviours and whatever he's been doing, but not everyone's built to stay at a football club all their lives.",
      "\"It's very few and far between, one-club players within the whole of the Premier League, and it gets on my nerves a little bit. Everyone goes, 'Oh, he wants to leave Man United,' well Man United haven't been performing great. Man United are not winning anything at the minute, they're slipping down the tables of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "\"My history loves the football club, but nobody has to stay at a football club forever. And yeah, he didn't behave right at certain times, Marcus, we all get that, but he's a phenomenal footballer, and I think he went to Villa, did well, and I think he's now joined a massive football club in Barcelona, and I think it'll work out for him.",
      "\"Man United's part of his history, he'll always love the football club, he's been there since he was seven years of age, I know his family love the football club as well, but life moves on. Big players leave football clubs.",
      "\"Bigger players than Marcus have left Man United, and bigger players will leave the football club in the future as well, and hopefully he'll put Barcelona into Marcus Rashford's history as well, with the shining light on it, and he'll look back on what a great move it's been.\"",
      "Discussing how he expects Rashford to perform at Camp Nou, despite fierce competition from the likes of Raphinha and Lamine Yamal for his spot, Butt added: \"I've just got a sneaky feeling he's just going to blow it away, I really do. Because I've known him since he was seven, eight, nine, he's got such natural ability.",
      "\"And I think when Marcus came onto the scene, a young player, he didn't have any fears, he didn't have anything going on in his head. I remember him making his England debut, he just got the ball and faced up the full-back and runs at them, and his best position is off the left, and he can play up front off the left, and he had no fear, he was doing it all the time.",
      "\"And then he got into the first team and became the star. He was coming and he had loads of hype around him with all the good stuff he was doing off the pitch as well. And I think Marcus was then thinking too much about his game, and I think that's what's killed him. But now going to Barcelona, I've just got a funny feeling that he'll do really well.\"",
      "Rashford aired his views on United's struggles following his exit. He insisted that the Red Devils haven't properly evolved since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down in 2013, despite bringing in a string of high-profile managers.",
      "Chatting to Gary Lineker and Micah Richards on The Rest Is Football, Rashford said: \"At times I feel like United has been...we're hungry to win, so we will always try to adapt and sign players that fit this system, but it's reactionary. If your directions are always changing, you can't expect to win the league.",
      "\"You might win some cup tournaments, but it's because you have a good coach, good players, and you have match winners in your team, you're not there by accident. This is what some people forget. Yeah we have been way lower than what people deem United to be, but if you take a step back, which I've been able to do, especially over the last six months, what do you expect?",
      "\"People say we have been in a transition for years. To be in a transition you need to start a transition. It's like the actual transition has not started yet.\"",
      "Since his move to Barcelona, Rashford has featured in all three of the Catalan giants' La Liga fixtures this campaign. He appeared as a substitute in a 3-0 triumph against Mallorca and a 1-1 draw with Rayo Vallecano, as well as earning a starting berth in a thrilling 3-2 victory over Levante.",
      "The England international will now be hoping to get the nod for Barca's next fixture against Valencia at the Camp Nou on Sunday.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "With just one win each from their three league games, an embarrassing cup exit and questions over the make-up of their sides to contend with already this season, Manchester City and Manchester United meet today in a derby with a lot on the line, even if it is only September.",
      "Pep Guardiola's City come into the Etihad Stadium meeting off the back to two successive defeats to Tottenham and Brighton, while Ruben Amorim's Red Devils needed a last-gasp penalty to beat Burnley in their last outing.",
      "Confidence might not be too high heading into the clash then, but how confident are our team about their predictions? Here's what they've had to say:",
      "No matter how bad they are, you can never write United off at the Etihad. I can certainly see them getting a goal but I think City's attack will be too strong for a defence who struggled to defend at home to Burnley.",
      "Erling Haaland is fresh off scoring five for Norway - and it could've been more had he taken the penalty that he won. Injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are also blows for Ruben Amorim, as he might actually have to start his £73.7million striker, Benjamin Sesko.",
      "City have three difficult games over the course of the next eight days but I reckon they'll start off strong with a comfortable win. For Amorim, the pressure will be piled back on. Prediction: Man City 3 Man Utd 1",
      "Remember that goalless derby draw at Old Trafford in April? It won't be as bad as that because nothing really can be ever again, but after two defeats from three games Pep Guardiola will crave control in this one, and that might make it a tough watch.",
      "If Liverpool win at Burnley earlier on Sunday then City would be going into the game nine points off the top already, and they really can't afford to let that gap get any bigger regardless of how early in the season it is.",
      "Ruben Amorim got a smash and grab win at the Etihad last season in one of his first big results at the helm, and he might try and adopt a similar approach and hope that City run out of legs as they did alarmingly at Brighton last time out.",
      "The thing is though, have United got the firepower to take advantage of any City slackness? Without Matheus Cunha I can't really see it, so I'll go for Guardiola's boys to cling on to the three points. Prediction: Man City 1 Man Utd 0",
      "Manchester City have lost their last two Premier League games, but I think they might run riot against United on Sunday. Erling Haaland has looked as sharp as ever and plundered five for Norway on Tuesday. He'll be up against Altay Bayindir and a United defence that was troubled by Grimsby not long ago.",
      "United's balance (or lack of it) in midfield, with Casemiro still possessing plenty the nous that made him one of the best defensive midfielders in the business, but crucially none of the mobility, and Bruno Fernandes, who is at his best as a No.10, is a staggeringly obvious issue that Ruben Amorim continues to ignore.",
      "If Tijjani Reijnders rampages into the box, like he did on debut against Wolves last month, then City can blow United away. Prediction: Man City 3 Man Utd 1",
      "If United were fully fit, I’d still probably back City to win relatively comfortably. So with no Lisandro Martinez, Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot the equation becomes even simpler.",
      "I’ve been burned by United in these predictions time after time, but I’m still going against them. There’s an argument to be made that Altay Bayindir wouldn’t start for any other Premier League team, so the fact he is for United is pretty damning - and could prove the decisive factor.",
      "United under Amorim have produced their best performances when they are allowed to sit in, soak up pressure and break at pace.",
      "Cunha is a brutal miss in that respect, with his ability to travel with the ball from deep and create for those around him.",
      "City have hardly set the world alight either. But I fancy them to settle into one of their long winning runs fairly soon. I'm not anticipating it to be particularly pleasing on the eye for the neutral, but City should have enough quality. Prediction: Man City 2 Man Utd 0",
      "They say that form is temporary and class is permanent. Although Man City's form has been underwhelming for a long time compared to what we're all now used to, the quality they possess is certainly still there. Plus, Man Utd's start to the season is hardly something to get too excited about. Sesko is struggling, Cunha is injured and Amorim has endless goalkeeper issues that are never fixed.",
      "Late win or not, Man Utd celebrating a last-minute win against Burnley like they won the Champions League speaks volumes about where they are at as a club. Prediction: Man City 3 Man Utd 1",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ashley Young snubbed Manchester City and Liverpool in favour of a move to Manchester United. As he was gearing up to depart Aston Villa back in 2011, Young was a sought-after player but joining Sir Alex Ferguson's side was an easy choice for him.",
      "The versatile star transitioned from a dazzling forward at Villa Park to a dependable full-back during his time with United. Young racked up 261 appearances for the Red Devils, clinching the Premier League title and other significant honours before leaving for Inter Milan in January 2020.",
      "Now 40, Young, who recently joined Championship side Ipswich Town, continues to impress despite his advancing years. He is likely to be watching as United and City lock horns in the first Manchester derby of the season on Sunday.",
      "Recalling his move to United amid interest from City and Liverpool, Young told UTD Podcast in 2019: \"My agent called me and said, 'Listen, you're going into the last year of your contract [at Villa], there are a few teams that are in for you.",
      "\"He said Liverpool. We'd already spoken to City. Then he said United had come in. And I said, 'When am I [to] meet Sir Alex [Ferguson]? Where's the pen?' There was no other place I wanted to go.",
      "\"The history of the club, the players that were here, what they'd achieved. For me, that was the place I wanted to be. I wanted to go there and put my marker down on this club and play for the biggest club, for me, in the world. As soon as my agent said that... we didn't even meet Liverpool.\"",
      "The England winger admitted he was starstruck during his first meeting with Sir Alex. He added: \"I always remember the meeting with Sir Alex in London.",
      "\"I think it was probably a two-hour meeting. Ten minutes of that, we spoke about football, the rest was about horses and wine! It was one of them where the boss has just got that aura.",
      "\"He challenged me and said you either sink or swim. That's basically what it is, you're going to be challenged every day. And that's what I wanted. Ultimately, it was down to me to make the decision and as soon as I could sign here, I wanted to sign.\"",
      "Young indeed rose to the challenge, becoming a member of United's last league-winning squad in 2013 and later being appointed as captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019.",
      "Young's first derby was one to forget, as it came during the 6-1 thrashing in 2011. He also enjoyed some success in the fixture, winning four out of 12 matches, including a memorable performance in which he scored once and set up two goals in a 4-2 triumph in 2015.",
      "Two years ago, Young opened up about maintaining a relationship with Ferguson. He told the Telegraph: \"I talk to them all [previous managers]. I won't say the best but the one who has given me the most is 'The Boss', Sir Alex. The one I still talk to most is 'The Boss'.\"",
      "Despite leaving United in 2020, Young's ties to the club are still strong. At Ipswich, he is playing under Kieran McKenna, who was a part of United's first-team coaching staff for five years before taking the reins at the Tractor Boys in December 2021.",

      "Pep Guardiola and Erik ten Hag pursued Ederson and Andre Onana respectively and the motivation was simple - both goalkeepers would evolve the way their manager's wanted to play.",
      "The two tacticians decided after a year at the helm that they needed to upgrade their shotstoppers if they were to achieve what they set out to do. Manchester City's former goalkeeper departed English shores this summer having put himself in the conversation of the Premier League's best ever goalkeepers.",
      "Onana meanwhile leaves in a similarly live debate, discussing who may be the worst goalkeeping investment in England's top flight. Ederson set City back £35million when they signed him from Benfica in 2017.",
      "If players are judged on a value for money basis then few have paid their fee back more than the Brazilian, who immediately did exactly what he said on the tin. He's ball-playing ability immediately evident as he sprayed passes in the same ilk as former team-mate Kevin De Bruyne, all from his own 18 yard box. His exploits being compared to a quarterback such were his vision and accuracy.",
      "Within months Ederson had clips going viral as he controlled balls out of the air in his own half before passing backwards such was his advanced position. His feet were so impressive that when City found themselves in the midst of a penalty-scoring crisis the goalkeeper was touted as a possible solution.",
      "In stark contrast to that Onana was raising his own red flags on debut. The goalkeeper flying out in stoppage time on his first outing with United 1-0 up before clattering into Wolves ' Sasa Kalajdzic. A VAR check somehow saving him - something the PGMOL would later admit was an error.",
      "The mistakes kept on coming as teams found ways to breach United's goal with relative ease. Even if Onana was more capable than David de Gea with his feet, it certainly wasn't worth the fear he had put into his back four. Ten Hag was left to stick by him more through stubbornness than belief.",
      "The then United boss launched a staunch - and questionable - defence of Onana months after his arrival. Ten Hag claiming: \"If you analyse it well then you see he is the second-best goalkeeper in the Premier League.\" This was a Premier League that included Ederson, Alisson and Emi Martinez among his goalkeepers.",
      "City's former shotstopper can boast three successive Golden Gloves on his CV, partly owing to his stellar backline, but equally reflective of the commanding presence he continued to be in between the sticks for an all-conquering City side.",
      "His exit this summer came after eight years with an acceptance that the two parties had done all they could together and City needed to bring in new blood. The Ederson-era in Manchester will go down in the club's history books with Gianluigi Donnarumma his replacement.",
      "Turkey is his new home after making the move to Fenerbahce. And in the Super Lig he will now be joined by Onana himself with the United goalkeeper making a somewhat surprising loan switch to Trabzonspor. Ruben Amorim had shown no desire to move on the Cameroonian, even if he was eyeing a new goalkeeper during the summer.",
      "The Red Devils signed Senne Lammens on deadline day but still very much planned to have Onana as an option. But a route out of Manchester has emerged and, perhaps tellingly, United haven't stood in his way.",
      "A heavyweight club allowing their, apparent, first choice goalkeeper to leave is a move that speaks volumes in itself. Onana's only outing this season saw him make another howler as United were embarrassed by Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "And so he'll call Trabzonspor home for the upcoming season. His debut coming against Fenerbahce as they boast their new goalkeeper, Ederson, who will also be making his first outing.",
      "Two goalkeepers who have called Manchester home now get to enjoy the sunny surroundings provided by the Turkish climate. But there's no doubt that Onana arrives under a cloud. Amorim has not yet faced the media to explain why he let the 29-year-old leave the club.",
      "Faith appeared to be dwindling with Altay Bayindir starting all three Premier League games thus far. The signing of a up and coming goalkeeper is also the furthest thing you can get from a glowing endorsement. But the nature of the loan agreement means Onana will be back in Manchester next year.",
      "So whilst Ederson can embrace his new life in the Super Lig safe in the knowledge he'll go down as a modern day pioneer for how goalkeepers can be used, Onana needs to somehow show that his last two years at United were rogue outliers in his career.",
      "What he's lacked in performance he's made up for in defiance. The ex-Ajax and Inter goalkeeper said in 2023 during his struggles: \"You want to tell me in six months the best goalkeeper in the Champions League last season can become the worst in the world? Nah. Everything is temporary. I know it'll be alright. If not today, it will be tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\"",
      "Safe to say, those in Manchester are still waiting for that day to come, and it certainly didn't happen when he said it would.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester City welcomes Manchester United to the Etihad this weekend for the highly anticipated Manchester derby. Recent meetings between these two sides have been entertaining affairs, with both teams scoring in four of the last five encounters and over 2.5 goals being recorded in five of the last six. City have been formidable at home, winning five of their last six league matches at the Etihad, while United have struggled on their travels, failing to win any of their last six away league games and losing four of those.",
      "Erling Haaland enters the derby in red-hot form, having scored five goals in a single game for Norway during the international break, and adding three goals in as many appearances for City so far this season. The Sky Blues, however, have made an uncharacteristically shaky start to their campaign, with one win and two defeats from their opening three matches. After a resounding 4-0 victory at Wolves, City suffered back-to-back losses against Tottenham (0-2) and Brighton (1-2), results that have increased the pressure on Pep Guardiola and his squad.",
      "This is the first time under Guardiola that City have lost two of their opening three league games, and coming off a season without silverware in 2024-25, there is mounting pressure on the Catalan manager, who could be entering his final season at the club. Nevertheless, City will take confidence from United’s own struggles and will be optimistic about securing all three points in front of their home fans.",
      "Guardiola will be hopeful that Phil Foden can recover from a foot injury in time for the derby, but Omar Marmoush, Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Josko Gvardiol, and Mateo Kovacic are all expected to miss out, while John Stones faces a late fitness test.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, come into this fixture with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss from their first three games. New manager Ruben Amorim is already under significant pressure, as his side have exhibited many of the same weaknesses that contributed to last season’s disappointing league finish. United’s campaign began with a 0-1 defeat to Arsenal, followed by a 1-1 draw with Fulham and a narrow 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break. While there have been occasional signs of improvement, United remain vulnerable, and Amorim is still searching for the right formula with his team selections and tactics.",
      "For this match, United will be without new signing Matheus Cunha, a significant blow to their attacking options, while Mason Mount remains a doubt and could also miss out. United will need several players who have yet to make a real impact to step up if they are to come away with a result.",
      "All signs point to another difficult afternoon for United, and we expect City to take advantage of their rivals’ struggles and add further pressure on Amorim with a home victory.",

There could be a new goalkeeper for Manchester City, though, with Gianluigi Donnarumma having arrived from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "United picked up their first win of the season before the two-week international break, beating Burnley 3-2. But those three points came at a cost, with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount picking up injuries. They will sit out of the City match, with Diogo Dalot also out injured.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes has once again been forced to defend himself over criticism about his style of leadership. The 31-year-old has been targeted for his emotional approach on the pitch, but he says he won't change.",
      "“People have an opinion about me and I can't change that,” said Fernandes. “It's the way people want to judge you about what they see on most of the people, what they see on the pitch, some of them, what they see on the television, some of them what they see on interviews.",
      "“You know, I can't change that. They have the freedom to think the way they want about me, as I have the same freedom to think about them. But what I don't do is I don't judge people until I know them. They can. They can have an opinion about me and that's fine.\"",
      "Manchester City could attempt to exploit Bayindir's weakness from crosses and set pieces in the derby on Sunday afternoon according to Craig Burley.",
      "“With Bayindir, every set-piece I’m putting Haaland and every centre half on him and just swinging it under the crossbar for fun,” Burley told ESPN. “Hell, if Man City have got someone who takes long throws, I’m throwing it in Rory Delap style. I’m just piling it into the box because he’s absolutely hopeless at coming out and dealing with aerial balls – he’s shown that.”",
      "Amorim is confident that Bayindir is up to the task. He said: “We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko has struggled to make an impact in a Manchester United shirt so far. But Rene Aufhaser, a coach who worked with Sesko and Erling Haaland at Red Bull Salzburg, has backed him to come good.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I'm sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see. I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.\"",

Haaland ended the game as a contest midway through the second half as he raced clear of the United defence and slotted home.",

      "Battled competitively with Haaland until the Norwegian got between De Ligt and Luke Shaw to make it 2-0. A dodgy pass almost resulted in a goal. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Did okay in the first half but was made to look like the auxiliary centre back that he is when Haaland bulldozed past him. Sloppy for the third goal, too. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "A confident return on his first start since the Europa League final until he was found to be off the pace for the second goal. Substituted just after the hour. 6",

      "A striking recall yet Ugarte was United's best player in the first half and operated at a level that was the polar opposite of his 45 minutes at Grimsby. Unable to halt City's second-half charge. 6",

      "Guilty of failing to track the runner for another goal that United conceded three weeks after Emile Smith Rowe evaded him at Fulham. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Could have intercepted the switch of play which eventually led to Foden's goal. Had chances to service Sesko but his crossing was abject. 4",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Had plenty of the ball without having any impact in the first half before he was denied by a great save by Gianluigi Donnarumma. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Played on the left of the two No.10s for probably the first time and miscued a volley. Nowhere near as influential as he was here last season. 5",

      "Same as Mainoo. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Replaced Ugarte to provide balance and missed a good chance. 5",
      "Manager",
      "Ugarte's improved performance rendered Mainoo's absence from the starting XI moot but Shaw and Fernandes in unfamiliar roles led to goals. 5",

      "Manchester City fans unfurled banners quoting Oasis classics Live Forever and Acquiesce at kick-off: \"We see things they'll never see.\" United will be glad to see the back of this derby.",
      "After a season unbeaten against City, normality was restored against a gettable City side. As much as Pep Guardiola's squad has changed over the last 12 months, two familiar faces did the damage.",
      "Phil Foden and Erling Haaland got their first derby goals in the 6-3 drubbing in October 2022. In the absence of the stellar support cast City boasted three years ago, they were the difference again. All seven of Foden's derby goals have come within the past three years, as have Haaland's. He got his seventh and eighth in the second half.",
      "And so Ruben Amorim has another inquest to endure. United were not as supine as on past visits to the Etihad when City were in their pomp under Guardiola but this was a toothless performance from a squad that invested more than £200million in attackers alone.",
      "This was the seventh time Guardiola's City beat United by scoring at least three goals. After Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag, Amorim is the latest United manager to be heckled by City matchgoers. They did not survive for much longer.",
      "\"They're never gonna win again, they're crying in the Stretford End, the reds are going down, Ruben Amorim,\" the City fans cackled. There was also a rendition of 'Old Trafford is falling down'. The Etihad's south stand roof, only ten years old, leaked onto United supporters.",
      "This was not a defeat set to be filed with some of the drubbings City have doled out to United until Haaland's second and contest-killing goal on 68 minutes. Then United were subjected to the City fans' Poznan and a couple of choruses of \"tearing Cockneys apart again\".",
      "That this City side is a work in progress and still inflicted nearly the same margin of defeat on United as Wolves ought to worry Amorim. United are taking backward steps week after week, recording worse results than in the corresponding fixtures last season. United drew at home with Arsenal and beat Fulham and City in 2024-25.",
      "United had gone into this derby above City in the table for the first time in nearly five years. The prospect of overtaking them again this season will now feel remote.",
      "Amorim is picking players out of position and out of their depth. United do not have a first-choice goalkeeper, Luke Shaw is not a centre back, Bruno Fernandes is not a central midfielder and Benjamin Sesko is goalless after seven games for club and country. A handful of City fans heckled Sesko upon his removal.",
      "Patrick Dorgu, recalled by virtue that he is the only senior left winger in this squad, demanded Bryan Mbeumo play him the pass. He was so far offside the linesman flagged immediately. Mbeumo voiced his dismay. The chipper Dorgu offered a high five. Overpromoted and in over his head.",
      "Shaw could not keep up with Haaland for the decisive second goal. That gulf is not easy to remedy but United had specialist centre backs on their bench.",
      "Three of the seven Premier League goals United have conceded this term have been down to a midfield runner failing to track an opponent. Fernandes was the closest to Foden and Matthijs de Ligt's exasperated reaction suggested he had seen that unfold before.",
      "In six hours of Premier League football, United have scored once from open play. Mbeumo, responsible for that solitary strike against Burnley, went the closest at City.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma was one of the first off the City coach and James Trafford one of the last. That all but confirmed Trafford was out of the team only three games into the season and Donnarumma was worked inside four minutes by the alert Benjamin Sesko. The best was yet to come from Mbeumo's 61st-minute volley that seemed destined to bounce off the side of the net.",
      "If City have two number ones, United have three number twos and all three were in the matchday squad. Tom Heaton bullishly addressed his teammates in a pre-warm up huddle. Senne Lammens' starrier status elicited selfie requests from supporters in the City section.",
      "The broadcasters homed in on Lammens within ten minutes after more dicey goalkeeping from Altay Bayindir. The culpability for Phil Foden's goal was on the dozy Fernandes rather than the stop-gap goalkeeper. Bayindir still shrank for Haaland's one-on-one. Donnarumma, in contrast, is so big he could block out the glare of the floodlights.",
      "Until Foden's header, Amorim was bullish on the touchline. Suddenly he looked vexed, smacking his hands angrily and outstretching his arms frequently. The much-improved Manuel Ugarte did earn an ovation for his urgent pressing.",
      "This Manchester derby began with a poignant and rousing tribute to a Mancunian. The stadium announcer was on the brink of tears as he read a eulogy to Ricky Hatton that was drowned out by the din from supporters red and blue.",
      "Fernandes preached calm, possibly spooked by the swiftness of Haaland's effort that flashed wide inside the first seconds. The United captain soon offered Sesko a thumbs up for his fourth-minute pot-shot.",
      "United's approach play was so promising that Guardiola's shoulders slumped more than once. None of it amounted to a chance before Foden guided Jeremy Doku's cross in on 18 minutes.",
      "Sesko was responsible for United's only two attempts in the first 45 minutes. There were not many of much consequence thereafter. The away end started emptying long before the final shrill.",
      "They had seen enough.",

      "Manchester City claimed a dominant derby day victory as Erling Haaland starred in a 3-0 win over a disjointed Manchester United.",
      "The Norwegian struck twice in the second period to add to Phil Foden's first half header as the Blues pulled clear of United.",
      "Haaland almost opened the scoring inside the first 20 seconds of the contest when he flashed a shot wide, while City debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma kept out a Benjamin Sesko effort in a frantic first five minutes.",
      "The breakthrough came on 18 minutes when Foden pounced to put City ahead, guiding home a header after some mesmerising footwork from Jeremy Doku.",
      "Tijjani Reijnders forced a save from Altay Bayindir as City hunted a second, while United had their moments but couldn't fashion a truly clear cut chance in the opening 45.",
      "The Reds began brightly enough after the break but City found a second seven minutes into the second half when Haaland finished expertly from Doku's through ball.",
      "Haaland nearly had a second moments later when City capitalised on some sloppy United play, but he nudged his shot against the post having rounded Bayindir.",
      "The home side were then thankful to Donnarumma for keeping United out as the Italian produced a magnificent save to tip Bryan Mbeumo's well struck volley behind.",
      "But City put the game to bed midway through the half when Haaland raced clear from inside his own half with the United defence AWOL to slot past Bayindir.",
      "There was still time for Reijnders to miss a golden chance to make it four when he raced onto Haaland's through ball and clipped the ball over Bayindir but wide of the far post.",

      "Here's the match analysis from the United point of view.",
      "The mercurial Mancunian with the everyman appeal, there was only ever going to be one match winner in the derby on a day when this city lost one of its greatest ever sportsmen.",
      "Before kick-off at the Etihad, red and blue alike paid tribute to Ricky Hatton with a thunderous round of applause that left TV cameras shaking and viewers back at home feeling dizzy. The Hitman might have been a die-hard Manchester City fan, but his personality and his pugilistic prowess made him a hero across Greater Manchester and beyond. Plenty of those situated in the away end would have been present at some of Hatton's greatest nights.",
      "He was also honest about his troubles away from the ring. Hatton faced his battles outside of his sporting arena, just as Phil Foden has fought his. The boyhood City fan spoke openly and honestly in May about how he had struggled mentally at times last season with issues off the pitch.",
      "So 20 minutes after this ground had rocked to the sound of people singing about 'walking in a Hatton wonderland', it was Foden's wonderland once again. Jeremy Doku got his cross right at the second time of asking and Foden guided a lovely header beyond Altay Bayindir for his first Premier League goal in eight months.",
      "Read the full City analysis here",
      "A disappointing defeat for United and it was difficult to point to too many positives for the visitors this afternoon.",
      "Here's how we rated the United players",
      "It was comfortable in the end for City.",
      "There were encouraging performances aplenty and here's how we rated the City players this afternoon",
      "That's the final whistle at the Etihad.",
      "Foden scored the opener and Haaland scored a brace.",
      "Dominant win for Manchester City in the derby.",
      "Four minutes added time at the Etihad.",
      "That's the chant coming from the City fans.",
      "Haaland and Bernardo have just been replaced by Bobb and Ake.",
      "City are set to record a dominant victory after two bad results against Spurs and Brighton.",
      "Rico and Savinho ON.",
      "Rodri and Dorgu OFF.",
      "Another heavy defeat in the Manchester derby is staring them in the face at the Etihad.",
      "Haaland is onside because he was in his own half when the pass was played.",
      "He was never going to miss when he was one-on-one against Bayindir.",
      "Mbeumo just burst into the box but he was pushed to running the ball out of play.",
      "Mainoo and Maguire ON.",
      "Yoro and Mazroaui OFF.",
      "Mbeumo has just been denied a stunning goal by an incredible Donnarumma save.",
      "That is a lovely City move. Foden injecting some fizz into it and Doku stepping up with a second assist. He said last week he was paying more attention to his stats this season and he needed to offer more. This is a great start for him.",
      "How haven't City scored? Guardiola is shocked on the touchline. That all started with Bayindir.",
      "I wonder how many mistakes he'll be allowed to make in the coming weeks until Lammens starts?",
      "Haaland is played into the box and he finished brilliantly above Bayindir.",
      "That was a smart finish from a deadly goalscorer.",
      "Guardiola looks strangely resigned down below us. Haaland has been over to him twice this half already and United fans are sounding quite chipper in that away end, despite the scoreline.",
      "Harry Maguire has just played ball boy to hasten the restart. He is one of four subs warming up (Zirkzee, Mainoo and Casemiro are the others).",

      "City lead thanks to Foden's goal.",
      "United just played a corner into the box and Donnarumma punched away.",
      "Guardiola has been unhappy with the rushed nature of City’s attacks on a couple of occasions, he would rather they slow it every now and again and put their foot on the ball. It’s been a scrappy game at times with both teams guilty of giving the ball away under little pressure.",
      "This has not been a high-calibre derby. It’s been very tepid since the goal and the decision-making from both sides has often been awry. A Mancunian settling the derby on the day one of its most feted sporting Mancunians died would be rather apposite. United have a couple of Mancs on their bench to turn to.",
      "Amorim visibly approves of Ugarte’s performance. He’s played well so far and has just got a hand from his manager.",
      "It’s not a hopeless situation for IUnited. They have performed respectably but they have not created an outright chance. Only Sesko has tested Donnarumma and that was in the fourth minute.",
      "Mbeumo was yards offside just there, but that was a wonderful ball from Ugarte over the top. Ugarte has actually started well, despite his selection raising eyebrows before kick-off.",
      "Now Amorim is looking vexed, smacking his hands furiously and outstretching his arms as City fans sing his name. There has also been an airing of ‘Old Trafford’s falling down’. Suddenly, it’s starting to feel like many of the derbies of the past 12 years.",
      "City fans are mocking United with their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "A fitting goalscorer. The mercurial Mancunian everyman who has been through some private battles opens the scoring and he looks up for this. He’s pointing the finger at Fernandes now after a disagreement and isn’t taking a backwards step. Credit to Doku, superb football in the lead up to the goal and a great cross when the ball came back to him."

      "Amorim signed Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day and Andre Onana has been shipped out to Trabzonspor on loan. Altay Bayindir has started the campaign as United's first choice goalkeeper and Amorim has confirmed he will start the Manchester derby.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount, Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are unavailable due to injury.",
      "This is how our writers think United should line up:",
      "Bayindir is starting but Tom Heaton would be the most dependable option. Sticking with the same back three would be advisable, given how decently Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have done. Patrick Dorgu comes back in to provide balance, with Amad on the right.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has thrived next to Casemiro in the past and they would be the logical partnership, given the alternative is Manuel Ugarte. United have played well without starting Benjamin Sesko but he has to come into the team at some stage and there are two significant absences in the attack. That said, a triumvirate of Mainoo, Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes could function more fluently.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Amorim has confirmed Bayindir will start, but he is an accident waiting to happen and I'd throw Lammens in at the deep end. Although there is logic in protecting Lammens by naming him on the bench, there is no better place to start than the Manchester derby to deliver a strong debut performance.",
      "Cunha and Mount have been ruled out, which means there needs to be a reshuffle. I'd start Casemiro and Mainoo in the midfield pivot and push Fernandes to the left side of the attack.",
      "Amorim had a twinkle in his eye when he discussed Sesko potentially making his first league start at his press conference on Friday. Sesko is the only choice to lead the attack this weekend because Joshua Zirkzee is not a goalscorer.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has hinted Benjamin Sesko could start against Manchester City.",
      "Sesko completed a €76.5million (£66.4m), plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, move to Old Trafford before the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Amorim decided to name Sesko on the bench for the opening league game against Arsenal, and the 22-year-old has made further substitute appearances against Fulham and Burnley.",
      "Sesko was given his first start against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, but he has not started in the Premier League. Amorim was asked for his verdict on Sesko at his press conference on Friday afternoon and hinted the young striker could be given his first league start in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"I think what’s more important than looking at exactly what he did during the games, is what he can bring to our team,\" said Amorim of Sesko's first few weeks at the club.",
      "\"If you see against Burnley, he had some movements – especially inside the box – that we don't have with Josh (Zirkzee), or with (Matheus) Cunha, and even with Rasmus (Hojlund) in the past. We have a guy (in Sesko) who really likes to go inside the box to have a header.",
      "\"He can run – we need to use him more as a runner – and he’s going to improve. So we need to get used to that. It feels like the pace is different and he is going to get used to that. But maybe against City, it is a good moment for him to start the game.\"",
      "Amorim has started Mason Mount down the middle in the Premier League this season, but Mount picked up an injury against Burnley and has been ruled out of the Manchester derby.",
      "United won 2-1 at the Etihad last season thanks to Amad's heroics in the game's final minutes. \"I don't know,\" said Amorim when asked whether the win backfired by raising expectations.",
      "\"It's hard to point to a game last year that was a backfire. We had so many moments like that. We just focus on the future. We have four points. I think we should have more in this moment, but we need to be really competitive.",
      "\"It’s a very important game for everybody here, but especially for our fans, so we will try to do our best.\"",
      "When asked about potentially having more pressure on him than Pep Guardiola, Amorim responded: \"No, you cannot compare. The guy (Guardiola) is winning all the time. He can relax in not winning anymore.",
      "\"I have to prove myself every day here and I feel that. So I'm really comfortable with that and I think that every day that I come here, that I have to do better. To compare me with the situation of Guardiola? Is just a joke (laughs).",
      "\"I think we have bigger problems. We continue to have bigger problems, but we are addressing everything. And sometimes we are frustrated, angry… but we are facing all the problems.",
      "\"And we are trying to improve. And I see the team playing so much better now. We just need to be more clinical, to win more games and things are going to get easier.\"",

      "Manchester United take on Manchester City in the Manchester derby this afternoon.",
      "United have made a disappointing start to the season and needed a late goal to secure a win against Burnley before the international break, but City have also won just one league game.",
      "Ruben Amorim oversaw a shock 2-1 comeback victory at the Etihad last season thanks to heroics from Amad in the game's final minutes. It was 0-0 when the two sides clashed again at Old Trafford in April.",
      "United will be without Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot due to injury, but City have their own injury concerns, with Omar Marmoush among those to be ruled out through injury.",
      "Here are five things to look out for in the Manchester derby:",
      "Two league wins on the bounce?",
      "Amorim was appointed from Sporting Lisbon in November, but he has yet to win successive games in the Premier League. That is no surprise given how dismal last season was, but it's an unwanted record.",
      "United were excellent in the first half against Burnley before the international break and could have been 3-0 up by half-time. The Reds were wasteful in front of goal and allowed Burnley back into the game.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' penalty in the 97th minute sealed an important victory and United now have the opportunity to do something they have never done before under Amorim: win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Sesko to make his full league debut?",
      "There was a glimmer in Amorim's eye when he discussed Benjamin Sesko in the embargoed section of his press conference. Amorim was asked for his thoughts on Sesko and said: \"I think what’s more important than looking at exactly what he did during the games, is what he can bring to our team.",
      "\"If you see against Burnley, he had some movements – especially inside the box – that we don't have with Josh (Zirkzee), or with (Matheus) Cunha, and even with Rasmus (Hojlund) in the past. We have a guy (in Sesko) who really likes to go inside the box to have a header.",
      "\"He can run – we need to use him more as a runner – and he’s going to improve. So we need to get used to that. It feels like the pace is different and he is going to get used to that. But maybe against City, it is a good moment for him to start the game.\"",
      "Amorim smiled as he finished his answer, and Sesko could be set to make his full league debut.",
      "United to hammer title hopes?",
      "It would be foolish to suggest City won't win the Premier League if they lose on Sunday, but the last time City lost three of their first four top-flight games was in 1995/96 under Alan Ball.",
      "That campaign ended in relegation. That won't happen this season, but defeat in the derby could see them fall nine points behind Liverpool.",
      "That is added motivation for United this weekend. Dishing out an early blow to City's hopes of winning the league would make a win even sweeter, and City's supporters have been notably edgy in the build-up to the game.",
      "Local representation",
      "There could be no Mancunians starting in the Manchester derby. There were no local United players in the team when the two sides met at Old Trafford in April, which was the first time in a decade that was the case.",
      "Altay Bayindir will start in goal with Tom Heaton potentially not even in the squad. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to cement his place in the starting XI under Amorim but there's hope he could start tomorrow.",
      "The Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability (PSR) rules incentivise the sale of homegrown talents and local representation in Manchester derbies could be reduced even further in the coming years.",
      "Amorim's record vs Guardiola",
      "Amorim has faced Guardiola five times in his managerial career. United's head coach has won two games, drawn twice and suffered one defeat, so he has a strong record against the Catalan coach.",
      "Sporting won 4-1 against City in the Champions League just before Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford. United won 2-1 against City at the Etihad in December and drew 0-0 in the reverse fixture.",

      "Manchester United's stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final was made sweeter by the goalscorers at Wembley.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were developed in the club's academy, and the pair contributed heavily to a truly great United performance.",
      "It meant more to see academy graduates topple rivals Manchester City.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner was particularly special given his Stockport roots. Erik ten Hag had entrusted Mainoo with first-team opportunities and the midfielder grabbed his chance with both hands.",
      "Ten Hag described Mainoo as the \"perfect midfielder\". Gareth Southgate said England \"haven't really had a player like him until now\". Mainoo started for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain.",
      "Just 14 months later, Mainoo is out of favour at United and was left out of England's squad for the September international break. There are concerns about where Mainoo fits into Ruben Amorim's system and Thomas Tuchel has explained he needs minutes to feature in his England plans.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window and fans questioned why such a talented young player felt he needed a change of scenery.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to fight for his place in his starting team, but eyebrows were raised when United's head coach said Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes to start.",
      "The next few months will be pivotal for Mainoo. The 20-year-old is suddenly at a crossroads in his career and wants to feature at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Mainoo was a talking point at Amorim's press conference ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday.",
      "\"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,\" said Amorim when asked whether he'd seen a difference in Mainoo. \"I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed - I did this week.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling. I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League so far this season. Amorim said: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he could clarify the \"most important things\" that he looks for in a midfielder. \"Everything. Sometimes, it's the balance in the midfield,\" he responded.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo is really good at controlling the game, but if he plays as an eight, he has to reach the box, returning (tracking back), and sometimes he has to cover a lot of space with just two.",
      "\"Bruno is doing that job. And then sometimes it's bad luck. Bruno is maybe the more influential player in the last few years, and he’s been playing in that position. Kobbie Mainoo could play as a six (a defensive midfielder), but sometimes he passes the ball and goes away and it's not a reference as a six, so we have to balance everything.",
      "\"I think he needs to have the technical ability that he has, but he needs more pace. He needs to understand the position better. He needs to play in different speeds. Sometimes it's lower.",
      "\"Sometimes it's faster, and I think he can improve on that. And then he has to beat Bruno. He has to beat Casemiro. He has to beat Manu (Ugarte). They are good players, also. So I need to choose.\"",
      "Amorim relocated Mainoo to the deeper midfield role throughout pre-season, but does he have a suitable midfield partner in the squad? \"I don't know. It depends on the game,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"It depends on the opposition. It depends on set pieces sometimes. All these things matter when you choose the team. Kobbie Mainoo is a very, very good player, but so is Bruno. So okay, I could put Bruno on the side, or I can push him up, but then I have to take Cunha (out).",
      "\"I can put Cunha on the other side, but then I take Bryan (Mbeumo) out. Sesko is on the bench all the time. I'm trying to make choices, and to play for Manchester United, you have to have more than 11 players, that's my feeling.\"",
      "Amorim insisted he was \"really happy\" with his midfield options. \"I'm not going to say that I'm not happy,\" he added.",
      "\"That's the point, guys. You ask me if I'm confident with my goalkeepers; I don't know what is going to happen. I'm not going to say to you, no, no, I'm not confident with my goalkeepers – I need another guy.",
      "\"I am not this guy. They are human beings. My players are the best ones until they move.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was not included in the Reds' 21-man squad for the Premier League season but will still be eligible to play in the top flight for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mainoo has had a rocky time playing under Amorim since the Portuguese arrived at Old Trafford in November. The midfielder has not played the amount of games he would have liked and has found himself struggling to fit into the new system.",
      "After signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United have chosen to move captain Bruno Fernandes deeper meaning Mainoo is now in direct competition with the Portuguese playmaker for that position. The Englishman's only start this season came in the Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby Town and soon afterwards he requested a loan spell away from the club.",

      "Unsurprisingly, Mainoo is a popular figure among the fanbase and many fans would have had their hearts in their mouths when they saw that the midfielder was not included in Amorim's squad list for the remainder of the campaign. However, thanks to the midfielder's age, he does not have to be registered along with most of his first-team colleagues.",

      "And Parker, who won two Premier League titles at M16 in the 1990's, has raised concerns over several issues at United under Amorim. He begins with their handling of Andre Onana - who left to join Trabzonspor on loan earlier this week.",
      "\"It was something that could have been done a lot earlier. The start of the season, with everyone knowing that he just wasn't good enough to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"Then he's given his first game in that disastrous evening at Grimsby, that's where it just carried on from where it left off the previous season, and now it's got to the point of them letting him go now, already into a season.",
      "\"I think we have to say that maybe one of the reasons they wanted him to go was that things were pretty sour while he was around, and when you're trying to move forward, and you've got a young goalkeeper, which you brought in place of him, you've got an experienced goalkeeper who isn't gonna help.",
      "\"You have to get them out of the way because they're just gonna cause problems. It's good that United have managed to get him out, but it's far, far too late.\"",
      "Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start on Sunday. Parker, however, believes new Reds keeper Senne Lammens should be given the gloves at the Etihad Stadium this weekend.",
      "\"Well, given everything, I think you've got to start him,\" Parker insists. \"If you put Bayindir in goal, where's his head at?",
      "\"I was having kittens in that Fulham game watching him play. I mean, that was terrible, and all of a sudden you made Fulham look like prime Arsenal with their coolness. I think you've got to start the new keeper.\"",
      "On Amorim and what United can achieve - Parker insists that Europe has to be the objective, but raises fears over a potential relegation battle.",
      "\"They need to get their credibility back,\" he said. \"They've got to finish in the top half of the table.",
      "\"As far as I'm concerned, they've got to be back into Europe again. You can talk about it being the Conference League, but still, it's Manchester United in Europe. The Conference League is looking to make a name for itself.",
      "\"I'm sure that there were a lot of people laughing at the Cup Winners' Cup at one point. No one was laughing after Man United won it in 1991. Everything was then about the European Cup.",
      "\"But these competitions need big clubs, they need big players, they need big managers to play in it, and if United were to qualify for it, that means they've shifted up in their position last season. It means that they've taken a step forward as a team because they've shown a little bit more consistency to qualify for Europe.",
      "\"You're judged by what you deliver over a duration of time, and what they delivered over the duration of time last season was embarrassing, really. It was just lucky there were three awful teams and that's the only thing that made it better for them.",
      "\"Wow, this season. The teams that have come up already looked better than the three that went down. It seem like they can handle themselves. They've got something about them, more than what the other three did, so you can't can't let your standards drop. If United let this standard drop a smidgen, they're relegated this season, that's the difference.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised to prolong Manchester United's record of including an academy player in every first team matchday squad dating back to October 1937.",
      "United only have four academy members in their current first team squad following the sale of Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea. Tom Heaton, 39, has not played since February 2023, Tyler Fredricson is likely to struggle for playing time after his first-half performance in the League Cup defeat at Grimsby Town, Kobbie Mainoo has started in 16 of Amorim's 46 matches in charge and 17-year-old striker Chido Obi is yet to be included in a matchday squad this term.",
      "Mainoo, 20, wanted to leave on loan last month but was blocked by the club amid a shortage of specialist midfielders. The Mancunian scored the winner in the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City and could start in Sunday's derby at the Etihad in the absence of injured duo Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The derby will mark the 4,326th consecutive United match with an academy player in their squad. \"I don't want to be the guy that broke that record,\" Amorim stressed. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future. So I will try to maintain that.\"",
      "United were unbeaten against City across three derbies last season and won at the Etihad in Amorim's seventh match in charge through two late goals.",
      "City suffered their first trophyless season since Pep Guardiola's first at the club in 2016-17 and dropped to third in the table, having won four successive Premier League titles. They have spent more than £300m on signings this calendar year but have lost two of their first three league games and head into the derby below United.",
      "\"It's a top team with the best coach in the league,\" Amorim added. \"A team that is really hard to imagine how they are going to play.",
      "\"They change all the time. But we are prepared for that.",
      "\"And we believe in our team. And I have that feeling. So it will be a very good game. We know what to do, we have one more training. The table, in the moment, it doesn't matter. I'm just worried about maintaining the same principles. The way we fight for every ball. The small details that sometimes we drop a little bit. Not in these games.",
      "\"So I'm more comfortable in these kinds of games. But we will be ready against a very, very good team.\"",
      "Amorim is convinced United have improved since they defeated City nine months ago. \"I think we are a better team. Any aspect, if you see the data, we are a different team. We are ready to play the game. But we have to show onside. So I think we are a better team.\"",
      "Amorim's close friend, Hugo Viana, is now the City sporting director. Viana and Amorim worked together at Sporting and the prospect of a reunion at the Etihad was floated before United hired Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag in October.",
      "Viana and Amorim still socialise but their friendship will have no bearing on the weekend's game. \"No, it has no influence. We have different jobs, we have different clubs. We have dinner all the time and don't talk about football.",
      "\"I'm red, he's blue. But we are really, really close friends. That will not change. So I hope to win Sunday and that's it.\"",

      "Whilst strolling through the quaint streets of Lyon hours before Manchester United’s Europa League quarter-final, a WhatsApp voice note arrived from a contact. It contained an instruction.",
      "In the event that United won, this correspondent was advised to get Andre Onana’s attention in the mixed zone by addressing him with a specific phrase in Italian. Onana would then stop to chat and do something “funny” to defuse the fallout from his pre-match comments that United were “way better” than Lyon. Onana’s own brand of comedy was reserved for his performance that evening.",
      "There were two more errors, the second an added-time fumble that invited Rayan Cherki to equalise. Before kick-off at the Groupama Stadium, Onana, iPhone headphones on, casually strolled over to one of the goal frames to check that they were stable. They were. He wasn’t.",
      "Officials at United were unhappy about the “way better” quip that Onana uttered to four of us in the makeshift mixed zone at Old Trafford, the only memorable event from a dour derby. Onana’s delivery was not disparaging yet it elicited a withering response from Nemanja Matic at the pre-match press conference.",
      "“If you are one of the worst 'keepers in Manchester United history, you need to take care,\" Matic warned. \"If David de Gea, Peter Schmeichel or Edwin van der Sar said that, I would question myself.",
      "\"But if, statistically, you are one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United's modern history, he needs to show that before he says.\"",
      "Onana never truly recovered from that week. The public ridicule preceded his withdrawal from the weekend shellacking by Newcastle United. Ruben Amorim took him out of the firing line and has now effectively fired him. His exit route to Turkey signals career decline at 29, a premature age for a goalkeeper.",
      "A montage of Onana’s ‘mistakes’ has gained 2.2 million views online. Some additions are unfair and some glaring errors are also conspicuous by their absence. In 102 appearances, Onana comfortably conceded at least two dozen saveable or avoidable goals, depending on the slack you cut a ‘keeper.",
      "A quirk of his second sorry season is that it was going well until Amorim arrived. No memorable cock-ups, important saves in key games at Southampton and Porto and a save of the season contender at Crystal Palace. The regression was instigated by Arsenal and their set pieces three days before Morgan Gibbs-White’s pot-shot unfathomably flummoxed Onana.",
      "Senior figures at United were downplaying a goalkeeping addition in the final weeks of last season. The priority was the attack and people at the club liked Onana’s character. Us journalists can attest to this.",
      "On a chilly evening at the City Ground, Onana was warm company as he admitted how trying his first six months in Manchester had been off the pitch. He is a bullish and candid conversationalist befitting a United goalie. He could talk the talk but not walk the walk.",
      "Onana was under the impression he was safe on account of his warm rapport with Amorim. Perhaps Amorim lulled him into a false sense of security. Onana had a tight bond with Erik ten Hag and was never going to be as close with Amorim, who has leant heavily on fellow Portuguese speakers Bruno Fernandes, Diogo Dalot, Casemiro and now Matheus Cunha. Ultimately, their working relationship was moot as Onana continued to err.",
      "Historically, United have had to bide their time when it comes to replacing an incumbent number one. De Gea was released after weeks of indecision. Tim Howard, Fabien Barthez and Mark Bosnich had ceased to be the first choice by the time they were jettisoned. Alex Stepney had a second lease of life after Wilf McGuinness was sacked with the reappointment of Sir Matt Busby. Onana is not halfway through a five-year contract and his escape routes were reduced to Turkey or Saudi Arabia.",
      "He has not even moved to one of Turkey's eminent clubs. Jose Mourinho, an admirer of Onana’s, had no intention of moving for Onana before he was dismissed by Fenerbahce, who opted for the other phased-out goalie from Manchester in Ederson. Galatasaray were also keen on the Brazilian.",
      "Not for the first time, United have botched a succession plan in goal. Onana represented a more modern goalie than De Gea yet his once-famed distribution deserted him last season.",
      "United have settled for, or rather saddled with, Altay Bayindir. The consensus at United is the club is \"too demanding\" for a goalie who warmed the bench for Turkey during their World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "Come Onana's last final appearance at Blundell Park, he was booed. United matchgoers became regularly irked by his delayed restarts at goal kicks last season, their mood not helped by Onana occasionally urging them to relax.",
      "This jarred with his pre-season promise: \"I will take a lot of risks. I can tell you in advance already!\" he chuckled to a few of us pitchside at UCLA. \"Be prepared because it’s gonna be this season, trust me! I will enjoy it even more when this season starts.\"",
      "A few weeks after the aborted ‘funny’ in Lyon, United were revelling in one of their most accomplished European away victories of the last decade in Bilbao. Onana strolled past me in the San Mames mixed zone and offered a knowing wink.",
      "He sometimes kept goal as if one eye was permanently closed.",

      "Mather has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role and the player is understood to be keen to play regular competitive football.",

      "The transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey remain open, so there may see some departures from Old Trafford. Although the summer transfer window has closed in England, several United players could be on their way out as the trading periods in Saudi Arabia and Turkey are still active.",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana is one player who has left after securing a season-long loan move to Trabzonspor on Thursday. Tyrell Malacia's loan move to Elche fell through, but a temporary switch to Eyupspor is reportedly on the cards.",
      "However, there were reports on Wednesday evening suggesting that the defender was not keen on the move. Meanwhile, potential future signings are also being considered, with a long-term plan in place for Brighton's Carlos Baleba after United were unable to finalise a deal this summer.",

      "Manchester United have submitted their Premier League squad for the first half of the 2025/26 season.",
      "Premier League clubs submit up to 25 players to form their squads. The list can be tweaked in the January transfer window, but each side have now submitted their squad before this weekend's round of fixtures.",
      "United have just 21 players in their squad, but the number is bolstered by players named in the Under-21 section, which include Leny Yoro, Kobbie Mainoo, Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven.",
      "Premier League rules state U21 players do not need to be named in the main squad, which can include no more than 17 players who do not fulfil the homegrown player criteria.",

      "United make the short journey to the Etihad Stadium for the first Manchester derby of the season on Sunday afternoon (4.30pm kick-off). Both teams will be looking to get one over on their rivals and take all three points.",
      "City go into the match looking to bounce back from two defeats from their opening three games. A 4-0 opening day win over Wolves has been followed by a 2-0 defeat vs Tottenham and a 2-1 loss to Brighton.",
      "The start of the campaign has been a mixed bag for United with one win, one draw and one defeat. There was also a sobering penalty shootout loss against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "They did however go into the international break on a high with Bruno Fernandes’ late penalty giving them a 3-2 win over Burnley in their last outing.",
      "Sunday's game at the Etihad will have the eyes of the world on it. Ahead of the match pundits have already been giving their thoughts as to what the outcome could be.",
      "Here’s a look at what just some have had to say.",
      "The former Man City striker told Stake.com: “Derbies are always emotional moments for teams and their supporters, living outside the realm of their regular ups and downs.",
      "“This one arrives with both sides raring for a change in fortunes. There's a spanner in the works too – the FIFA matchday that will have some players arriving worn out from international games. But I trust City will take the win.",
      "“These are usually tight matches, won by whoever better capitalises on their opportunities. A few exceptions here and there to this rule, no doubt – but I don't see any one of the two teams being overwhelmingly better than the other. I'd expect a high-intensity match.",
      "“I think it'll come down to midfield possession, so whoever gets more chances to stand out in that area, perhaps. It's a shame that [Rayan] Cherki is out, for this reason. That being said, I think City has the players to ensure controlling the ball as I mentioned.”",
      "Augero’s prediction: Man City win",
      "“Home win,” he told Betfair. “It's a huge game for both clubs already this season and it always is.",
      "“But because of what's happened to Man City and the pressure Man United could be under, it's a huge game. I'll go for a home win.”",
      "Shearer’s prediction: Man City win",
      "He told BetVictor: “What a game this should be and I’ll be honest, I’m not quite sure what to expect!",
      "“City have been all over the place in the last couple of games, I just didn’t see that coming. I do expect a big response from Pep’s side here though but defensively; Pep must have big concerns about his side.",
      "“As for United, they got that dramatic win over Burnley but was that just papering over the cracks? Only time will tell I suppose. I do like the way United attack and I think Cunha and Mbeumo have really settled in well and look such a threat.",
      "“I’m going for City to win 3-1 but it’s so hard to predict those two sides right now!”",
      "Redknapp’s prediction: Man City 3-1 Man United",
      "“I can see Bryan Mbeumo hurting City, with United counter-attacking and him being a thorn in their backline chasing balls in behind,” he told BBC Sport. “I am also not as convinced by City if James Trafford keeps his place in goal.",
      "“So, I think United will definitely score, but I still cannot go against City at Etihad Stadium because we know they will create chances there.",
      "“It is a massive week for them, with Napoli visiting in the Champions League on Thursday before they head to Arsenal next weekend, and of course people are going to judge them on these results. After losing two of their first three league games, this week could decide if they are in the title race, or if they are ruled out of it.",
      "“I don't want to keep bringing up the goalkeeper but City's chances of getting the results they need will definitely be improved if new signing Gianluigi Donnarumma is in goal because right now they need a big presence there, and Trafford doesn't give them that.",
      "“The same position is a huge call for United boss Ruben Amorim on Sunday too, but in a totally different way.",
      "“United signed Senne Lammens ahead of Villa's Emi Martinez, who has definitely got the kind of presence that brings confidence to his defence the same way Donnarumma does.”",
      "Sutton’s prediction: Man City 2-1 Man United",
      "“I thought Manchester United were really good the other day against Burnley,” he told SportsKeeda. “It was a bit like the Manchester United of the old times. But they still needed a penalty at the end to win that game and that is a concern if you ask me.",
      "“Manchester City looked comfortable until the substitutions changed the game for Brighton. I'm looking for reasons to back City here and I can't find any if I'm being honest! They don't have a player like David Silva or Kevin De Bruyne anymore, so who is going to step up?",
      "“Julian Alvarez was the kind of player who could have picked the ball up and pulled off something special in games like these, but they don't have him either! Erling Haaland isn't that type of a player, he relies on people like Silva and De Bruyne for service. And I've always said that Jeremy Doku is a hit-and-miss, so this isn't the dominant Manchester City we once knew.",
      "“City were terrible against Tottenham at the Etihad. I actually think Manchester United's front-three can hurt them in this game. I say that despite having the opinion that United will not finish in the top six this season, so you can imagine what I think of City at the moment!",
      "“I'm going to go for a draw but if someone told me I had to pick a winner, I would only choose Manchester United. I just don't think Ruben Amorim's men will lose this game.”",

      "It’s easy to forget who you are sometimes, and there are few things more damaging to anyone’s ability to perform at their best than an identity crisis.",
      "Manchester City had a massive dark night of the soul last season, and have shown signs this season that they still hadn’t quite re-discovered themselves. Nobody in that squad looked more lost last season than Erling Haaland and Phil Foden.",
      "This derby could be just what both players needed to make themselves feel sexy in the mirror once again.",
      "City fans got used to the sight of Haaland and Foden sulking around the pitch last season, two players who thrive off the knowledge they are just preternaturally talented in a way few players in world football can match reduced to the office grump who resents having to come into work every morning.",
      "We have sympathy. Both players have been world-class since they were teenagers, and happily took on the challenge of playing for the planet’s most esteemed manager at one of its richest clubs with stunning panache. Haaland, the brilliant unstoppable goalscorer. Foden, the uncontrollable dynamo who could pierce even the most stubborn of low blocks.",
      "Both set standards for themselves that vanishingly few players are able to maintain year after year after year. An off season for either players can be forgiven. The problem for City last season was that both of them lost the thread of themselves at the same time. Some 42 per cent of City’s games in which both players appeared last season ended with neither player on the scoresheet. It had been just 30 per cent in their treble-winning season in 2022/23.",
      "Pep Guardiola will take huge encouragement, then, that both Foden and Haaland were far more identifiably Foden and Haaland here. Foden’s guided header to open the scoring was followed by exactly the celebration you would expect from a Stockport lad scoring in the Manchester derby, proudly shoving the badge into the face of elated fans at pitchside. The fire has clearly not gone out.",
      "Having got that goal, it was clear to see that Foden was actually having fun. Guardiola’s response to that hard spell last season was to ease up on trying to press and grind opponents into submission, and instead concentrating on attacking more directly and intensely.",
      "That has not been an entirely easy transition for City, and Foden has had to get used to playing in a system in which he is no longer the pattern-breaking maverick who does things other players in that system can’t and don’t in tight spaces; that honour now falls to Jeremy Doku.",
      "But here, Foden looked like he was learning to stop worrying and love the extra space this quicker style of play can give him. He was volleying passes out to the wings, playing long balls in behind the United defence, and enjoying acting more as a playmaker than a penalty box crasher.",
      "Haaland, meanwhile, was an absolute pillar for City. When he is not enjoying himself, it shows up more much starkly than most, and he begins to feel like the kind of player who contributes nothing if he is not getting among the goals.",
      "Not here. He almost scored in the first attack of the game. He was winning towering defensive headers in his own box. He was chasing down United defenders. He was playing with his back to goal to bring others into play. He was doing it all with that sh*t-eating grin that opponents must absolutely despise, and which grew even broader after he completed a brace of goals in trademark style.",
      "Happy players tend to play better football, and nothing makes you happier than a resounding win against your closest rivals. City have to make sure they harness those vibes and make sure they don’t ebb away again.",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, with Viktor Gyokeres trying to keep pace.",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland has set a condition for staying at the Etihad Stadium beyond the end of the season, according to reports.",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola will not stand in the way of Erling Haaland if he wants to move away from the Etihad Stadium next summer, according to reports.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "An ‘agent’ has reportedly been ‘entrusted’ to ‘unlock’ a deal for Manchester City star Erling Haaland as a European giant plots an ‘incredible signing’.",
      "After a generation of small but technical strikers, the Premier League looks to be in a new era of huge centre forwards leading the line."

      "Ruben Amorim has explained why he didn’t hold talks with Kobbie Mainoo while the transfer window was still open after the Manchester United star asked to leave the club.",
      "Mainoo asked to leave United on loan towards the end of the window after not starting any of the opening three Premier League games of the season, but was denied his request by the club.",
      "“Like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,” Amorim said ahead of United’s clash with Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "“I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed, but I did this week. Because I don’t want Kobbie Mainoo thinking I was having any conversation with him just to hold onto him.",
      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done. I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "“I think for some guys it is enough, but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I’m helping Kobbie Mainoo and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.”",
      "A report earlier this week claimed the United board are ‘unhappy’ with their manager and are ‘wanting Amorim to tone down his emotional public outbursts’.",
      "Amorim’s decision to publicly claim that Mainoo will be competing with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot this season ’caused collateral damage that the Red Devils’ top brass could have done without as they negotiated a tricky end to the summer window’.",
      "Jason Wilcox ended up having to persuade Mainoo to stay late in the window and not pursue a loan move away from Old Trafford and it was ‘seen as a stupid and unnecessary move by Amorim, one lacking emotional intelligence and empathy with Manchester United’s history of homegrown young stars’.",

      "When asked by reporters how Mainoo is reacting to the situation, Amorim added: “He’s not used to fighting for his place, maybe. He’s uncomfortable, but he’s a very good kid. He wants to learn. Sometimes it’s hard to push different things from the players.",
      "“I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton. Nowadays, you can see that Vitinha is maybe the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes.",
      "“The way I play is completely different from the last manager. I watched a lot of games from the Premier League in Portugal. You can feel then that Manchester United really [played in] transitions. He was the only guy that calmed down the game. Now we have other players that calm down the game.",
      "“Sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo. Sometimes, maybe if I start [him] more, Kobbie Mainoo is going to play and he’s going to get hard to take out. I need to go with what I’m feeling at the moment and that is the only feeling. He’s starting the final of the European Championship in a team that has a lot of talented players – [Phil] Foden played that game, [Cole] Palmer was on the bench. He was playing. I know all that, but sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.”",

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has hit back at pundits and former players who have questioned his demeanour in the past.",
      "The Red Devils had a nightmare season in 2024/25 with Ruben Amorim’s side finishing 15th in the Premier League, while they lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd are not competing in European competition this season and have had a mixed start to the new campaign with four points from their first three Premier League matches.",
      "They are already out of the League Cup, with League Two side Grimsby Town knocking Man Utd out on penalties after the Red Devils came back to draw 2-2 in normal time.",
      "Fernandes has been one of the only shining lights in recent years with his goals and assists crucial to Man Utd keeping some level of respectability.",
      "Both Gary Neville and Roy Keane have praised Fernandes in the past for this aspect of his game but the Red Devils legends have also been critical of his leadership and demeanour on and off the pitch.",
      "READ: Liverpool ‘flop’ Florian Wirtz among Big Six sextet needing to step up after the international break",
      "After Man Utd lost 4-1 against Newcastle in April, Keane branded the Man Utd players as “bluffers” with Fernandes just providing “soundbites”.",
      "Keane said: “To be fair to Bruno Fernandes he fronts up, but to me it’s just soundbites now.",
      "“He was talking about his teammates and belief, but what about his right-back [Diogo] Dalot, who didn’t put a leg out to tackle? I hope he is pulling him in the dressing room because he keeps talking about having belief in his teammates, but real good teammates put demands on each other.",
      "“It must be tough playing in that midfield when the expectation is on him because that’s unfair on him. But when he’s doing his chats about supporters and this, to me it’s just soundbites. There is no meaning to it. I’m not sure this United group are an honest group.",
      "“The best players I played with put demands on me and wouldn’t tolerate me cutting corners. That’s what really good teammates do. These aren’t teammates, they are bluffers.”",
      "Man Utd captain Fernandes admits he accepts all different opinions but what he doesn’t do is “judge people until I know them”.",
      "When asked by the BBC about what people most commonly get wrong about him, Fernandes said: “Nothing. People have an opinion about me and I can’t change that. It’s the way people want to judge you about what they see on the pitch, some of them what they see on television, some of them what they see on interviews.",
      "“I can’t change that. They have the freedom to think the way they want about me, as I have the same freedom to think about them. But what I don’t do is I don’t judge people until I know them.",

      "It is not often in recent years that City approach a Manchester derby with as much trepidation as United. But the hosts at the Etihad on Sunday have just as many reasons – if not more – to fret over a game both managers could really do without.",
      "The timing is rotten for Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim. Coming on the back of a post-transfer window international break, the preparation for derby no.197 will be sub-optimal for both sides even before you begin to consider the wider contexts. And those wider contexts give Guardiola more grounds for concern than Amorim.",
      "Pep’s big worry: a title race in which City are already struggling with the pace in the wake of the worst start to a season in his managerial career.",
      "It is not an unrealistic prospect that City could be nine points behind Liverpool and seven off Chelsea by Sunday evening. The Reds and Blues face opponents fancied by many to struggle this season. That those teams, Burnley and Brentford, are on the same number of points as Guardiola’s men is a damning indictment on City, even at this early stage.",
      "That is what Guardiola will have spent most of the last fortnight stewing over. The City boss flew to New York for the US Open but he must have been preoccupied at Flushing Meadows by the thought of City pulling the chain on their title prospects with a derby repeat of the performances that reaped no points from Tottenham or Brighton.",
      "City were not especially wretched in either defeat. But more worrying for Guardiola than those performances in isolation is the absence of the aura that made them so dominant for so long.",
      "Guardiola would have hoped that last season was but a blip and that a summer reset, even around the FIFA Club World Cup, would give City a more familiar air of superiority, if not yet infallibility.",
      "But Tottenham and Brighton proved that the rest of the Premier League won’t simply get down on their knees again.",
      "Spurs are City’s weird kryptonite, but there was still an added zip and swagger about Thomas Frank’s side at the Etihad, especially on the break, that portrayed an absolute confidence that the hosts were vulnerable.",
      "At the AmEx, City assumed the control that Guardiola so craves before they relinquished it whole. And all it took was a quadruple substitution. After that, Brighton unleashed a storm on their visitors that the City of old would usually weather with little inconvenience. But this version of City, one evidently still traumatised and in transition, wilted.",
      "“We forgot to play,” as Pep put it and his four changes – two doubles – to counter Brighton’s, initially to steady the ship and then to stop it sinking, failed to have the desired effect.",
      "More lasting changes came in the following days, with Ilkay Gundogan, Manuel Akanji and Ederson waved off, the trio following Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Jack Grealish through the exit. It is a turnover that City planned for – most of it, at least – but one that sees a lot of stoic experience leave a dressing room already on the back foot.",
      "Such an overhaul prompts immediate questions over how Guardiola reacts to two defeats before a game that looks more than ever like a must-not-lose affair.",
      "Does Gianluigi Donnarumma make a derby debut after barely a few days in Manchester, immediately putting James Trafford’s nose out of joint? Donnarumma arrives in England after conceding four to Israel while getting away with punching a corner into his own net amid scathing reviews of his performance.",
      "Might it be an overhauled defence in front of whichever under-pressure keeper Guardiola goes with? There are question marks over the right-back and at least one of his centre-backs.",
      "MORE ON UNITED AND CITY FROM F365\n🔴 Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?\n🔵 Man City ‘gain something substantial’ from APT settlement\n🔴 Man Utd must accept now that Senne Lammens will f*** up…",

      "Guardiola is accustomed to making big decisions, but these are strange times for the City boss amid unfamiliar uncertainty over his options. And not often have there been so many to ponder at once.",
      "Which ought to empower Amorim and United to go to the Etihad on Sunday to follow Spurs and Brighton’s lead. The United boss won and drew his first two Manchester derbies, with 180 minutes of wretched mediocrity punctuated only by City caving in on themselves in the final minutes on their own patch.",
      "Amorim has plenty to ponder himself. Which goalkeeper gets the gloves? Are Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount fit? The outcome of those health checks will likely hold considerable sway in whether Bruno Fernandes remains in a deeper role alongside Casemiro.",
      "Whatever decisions Amorim takes, the United boss should be picking up the scent of blood wafting on the air from east Manchester. The Red Devils remain vulnerable enough to justifiably feel that a point would be a satisfactory outcome, but on Sunday, they have the opportunity to secure some respite from the harsh spotlight and thrust it upon their neighbours.",

      "And now Romano has explained what Lammens’ role will be at Man Utd this season, the transfer journalist revealed on GiveMeSport‘s Market Madness podcast: “I think they will be competing for the spot for the first-team goalkeeper, so it’s not going to be 100 percent guaranteed for anyone, but I’m sure that Senne Lammens is also a clear favourite.",
      "“I think Manchester United really trust him for the present, but also the future. They believe that this is one of the best young goalkeepers in the world, and so they really trust this boy.",
      "“They wanted Lammens strongly. Obviously, there was also the opportunity to go for Emi Martinez, which is a completely different profile – obviously to add some leadership, but also with different costs in terms of salary and transfer fee.",
      "“So they decided for Lammens, because they believe this is the ideal solution for the present and the future. I’m sure that Lammens has a very good chances to be the starting goalkeeper at Manchester United.”",
      "In his press conference, Amorim added on Lammens: “We are really pleased, he is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "“We are in a moment where we need a goalkeeper to be really strong, have a lot of experience, but also in a moment we have to look at the present, but with focus on the future, a little bit both. He is one more option to play. He will be ready.”"

      "When asked how long they will be out for, Amorim replied: “I don’t want to say. If you talk to Cunha he will say he is able to play this game. So I don’t know. We will manage day-by-day. They are pushing really hard and that is a good thing.”",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo will once again attempt to persuade Bruno Fernandes to leave Man Utd in January and move to Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "Al-Hilal made Fernandes their priority early on in the summer with the Saudi Pro League side willing to give the Red Devils midfielder a tax-free contract worth £700,000-a-week plus bonuses, which is around three times what he earns at Old Trafford.",
      "After talks between Fernandes’ agent, Miguel Pinho, and the Saudi club, the Man Utd captain decided to stay at the Premier League club for the time being.",
      "Revealing why he opted to stay at Man Utd over a move to Saudi, Fernandes – who has also attracted interest from Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad – said: “The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it.",
      "“There was a waiting period for me to think about the future. As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so.",
      "“I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go! The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave, that it was not a financial issue.”",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Fernandes added: “It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "“Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",
      "“But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions. and I feel capable of it.”",
      "In a fresh update on Saudi interest in Fernandes, Fabrizio Romano revealed earlier this week that clubs in the Middle East are ready to return for the Man Utd captain in 2026.",
      "Romano explained on his YouTube channel: “From Saudi, they want to return in the future. For 2026, keep an eye on Saudi because they will return. And then, it’s going to be up to Bruno to say ‘yes, I want to come’ or ‘no, I want to stay in Europe, no, I want to stay in Manchester United’.",
      "“But from Saudi, they want to return for Bruno Fernandes, and they keep the name of Bruno Fernandes in their list for the future targets. Keep a close eye on the situation of Bruno Fernandes because Saudi want to return.”",
      "And Spanish website Fichajes claim that current Portugal international team-mate Ronaldo ‘pressures’ Fernandes to join a Saudi club in January.",
      "Ronaldo has ‘stepped up his efforts to convince his compatriot to join the Saudi Pro League’ as the former Man Utd striker’s ‘role in Saudi Arabia’s football project goes beyond his performance on the pitch’.",
      "Although he failed to persuade Fernandes to join him in the summer transfer window, the report adds that ‘interest remains alive and could be revived by January 2026’.",
      "The report continues: ‘The English club is experiencing financial difficulties and could seriously consider selling one of its most valuable assets if an attractive offer comes in. Fernandes is entering the final stretch of his contract, increasing the pressure to define his future.’",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has hit back at pundits and former players who have questioned his demeanour in the past.",
      "Are you really a world-record holder if you have to lower yourself to counting goals scored against Scotland? Cristiano Ronaldo is an embarrassing fraud.",

      "The Premier League roars back after the international break with an absolute cracker of a weekend in store.",
      "There’s a Manchester derby where the Heavyweight Crisis Club belt is on the line, there’s the return of Ange Postecoglou, there’s the prospect of Alexander Isak and all manner of other shiny late-summer signings making their debuts, and in the Championship the long-awaited return of a south-coast derby to the league schedule after a 13-year absence.",
      "It is, in short, a very Big Weekend. Enjoy.",
      "A Sunday afternoon treat in store for us all in one of those games absolutely guaranteed to provide narrative out the wazoo no matter what happens.",
      "The fixture computer has been cruel indeed to Manchester City, compelling them to play their first two home games against the teams who inflicted the most embarrassing league defeats upon them at the Etihad last season.",
      "History has already repeated itself thanks to Spurs’ alarmingly controlled and tension-free 2-0 victory a few weeks ago, and City really cannot afford any kind of repeat of the late nonsense United pulled on them in a 2-1 win during the depths of City’s late 2024 despair.",
      "Whoever loses this really is in big trouble.",
      "If it’s United, then the difficulty of the fixture list will provide only scant mitigation for a poor league start (not to mention the Grimsby unpleasantness) in which Ruben Amorim has been lucky to nick a point against Fulham and even luckier to beat Burnley at home.",
      "He already sits atop the reformed Sack Race now Nuno Espirito Santo has been Marinakised and has both Chelsea and Liverpool to worry about in the weeks ahead.",
      "If it’s City, then the early crisis club mantle passes to the blue half of Manchester after three straight defeats and a title challenge petering out in mid-September and renewed questions about whether Pep Guardiola has the energy or desire to follow through on building himself another great City side on the back of all 24/25’s relative struggle.",
      "The most damning thing for City would be the fact that those three straight defeats would have come without a meaningful title rival in sight; that looms with next week’s trip to the Emirates which really would start to look like a fixture that could end City’s Premier League season before we’ve even reached the second international break.",
      "Or it could be a draw, in which case no firm answers can be reached but they’re probably both f*cked.",
      "So yeah. A Sunday afternoon treat for absolutely everyone, except for anyone who supports at least one and very possibly both of these clubs.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "",
      "Here he comes. He’s back. Angeball is inevitable.",
      "Nottingham Forest insisted they really didn’t want to get rid of Nuno Espirito Santo and had no intention to do so right up until the moment they, alas and alack, felt they simply had no choice given the breakdown in trust for which they were in no way responsible. Which all means the negotiations to appoint a replacement they hadn’t given a moment’s thought to previously were conducted in record time, with Ange Postecoglou appointed mere hours after Nuno’s midnight axe.",
      "Really, it’s just another reminder of what an efficient, well-run club Nottingham Forest are these days. That’s just the speed at which they can get things done.",
      "And another example of how efficient and clear-headed Forest are is in the way they’ve gone straight out and snaffled themselves a manager to provide seamless, frictionless continuity given the obvious similarities in the way he and Nuno operate.",
      "Yes, if unfortunate circumstances outside your control just after the end of the transfer window force you to replace the manager who last season delivered success wildly beyond any reasonable expectation, then really all you can do is go out and appoint the closest thing you can find to what you’ve lost.",
      "Or, of course, there’s the other option, which is to look at what’s worked so well for you and that departing manager and the squad you’d built for him over the last 18 months, and then appoint literally the most polar opposite manager it is possible to imagine, one whose tactics led a bigger and wealthier and far more established club to 17th place last season.",
      "It’s a genuinely brilliant slice of nonsense, this, and one that has absolutely no downside. It’s a plan so stupid that it might in fact be genius and actually work, in which case: great. There really are few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works.",
      "But do you know what is one of the few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works? Angeball when it doesn’t.",
      "If you’re not enormously excited by the prospect of Nikola Milenkovic playing a high line then we really are very different people.",
      "At the other end, though, Forest absolutely do have the attacking tools to cause teams serious pain when given freedom and licence to roam and with chests swelled with pride by one of Ange’s patented inspirational team talks.",
      "There’s a reason everyone who has played for Postecoglou seems to adore the bloke. It’s just who he is, mate.",
      "And of course the fixture computer has sent him to Arsenal for his first game back in the Premier League.",
      "It’s unlikely Ange has had time to get all his ideas across to his new charges, which for this game might well be for the best. It is a bit of a free hit for him anyway. Just pump the players’ tyres and send them out there. Get any kind of result and it sets him up for potentially the sort of instant ‘WTF?’ impact he had in those very early games at Tottenham.",
      "Lose, and he can just come out in the post-match interview and say ‘Warra trophy, mate’ and he still wins. Perfect.",
      "",
      "Always a highlight of this first post-interlull matchday, of course. We’ve all been starved of delicious Barclays for an agonising, drawn-out fortnight but when it comes back it comes back strong with all those late summer signings set for debuts, from Isak against Burnley to his assorted replacements for Newcastle, to Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani at Spurs, or Harvey Elliott for Villa, and the quite brilliant fact we really don’t actually know with any compelling certainty who will be in either goal for the Manchester derby.",
      "But Isak is clearly the star attraction here. Given that he’s short of match sharpness and had precious little time with his new team-mates due to confirmation of his move coming so late in the window and having to head pretty much straight off to international duty with Sweden, it’s very possible – likely even – that he is only on the bench for Liverpool at Turf Moor.",
      "That’s only a minor consolation for Burnley, though, who will have to deal with a still-elite attack posing nightmarish threats from every direction while also knowing that just as the fatigue of chasing Wirtz and Ekitike and Salah around for an hour or so really starts to kick in, they’re likely to have to deal with perhaps the Premier League’s best centre-forward stepping off the bench with sky-high motivation and myriad points to prove. Very best of luck to you.",
      "",
      "West Ham’s 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest just before the international break was perhaps the single most discombobulating result of that entire 30-match intro to the new Premier League season.",
      "Kneejerk assessments had been made of West Ham in the previous fortnight, and the consensus was clear: they were rubbish, and many people feared for them, they really did. We did. We do.",
      "But the chaotic final 10 minutes at the City Ground changed everything. It provided cover for Forest to do what they obviously wanted to do to Nuno, for one thing, but also sent the Hammers into the international break looking a very different beast and with potentially a very different season to the one everyone had prescribed for them.",
      "There is still the sense that it was just a freak nonsense. The goals coming in a rush at the end as they did certainly adds to that sense.",
      "So the challenge for Graham Potter and his players is to immediately disprove that theory. To immediately use it as a springboard to launch a season that had started so miserably.",
      "And for that reason there really are few better fixtures to follow it for West Ham than Tottenham at home. Spurs fans have long mocked West Ham for this game being the Hammers’ cup final, noise which quietened when West Ham inconveniently reached and won an actual cup final while Spurs were languishing in trophyless banterland.",
      "Last season’s Europa League win means that noise will return for a fixture that has a compelling history of high-level nonsense, one that has featured dramatic late winners for Spurs from names as varied as Paul Stalteri, Eric Dier and Gareth Bale, to Manuel Lanzini halting Tottenham’s bid to put the pressure on Chelsea in 2017 and more recent match-winning exploits from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard.",
      "West Ham haven’t lost at home to Tottenham since 2019, when Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of Spurs produced a chaotic 3-2 win that was in no way whatsoever a sign of things to come.",
      "The last three have ended in 1-1 draws, and even that would be enough to give West Ham something to work with moving forward. Which really didn’t look likely after those two miserable opening defeats and pitiful Carabao exit.",
      "",
      "The real El Clasicoast returns as a league fixture for the first time since a 2-2 Championship draw in April 2012, and 13 years in which assorted miseries have befallen both clubs. Especially Southampton, but especially Portsmouth.",
      "A Premier League team in 2010 became a League Two one by 2013 and it’s been a long slow climb back to the second tier and renewed acquaintances with their local rivals.",
      "Southampton themselves were in League One during Portsmouth’s final Premier League season, and just seven years later were completing a fourth successive season in the top flight’s top eight under managers like Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman.",
      "They then fell off, bobbed around a bit and last year, as Portsmouth finally dragged themselves back up into the Championship, Southampton tumbled back into it after the second worst Premier League season in history.",
      "And it’s Portsmouth who’ve now made the better start to this season ahead of the short trip to St Mary’s.",
      "",
      "Juventus bid to make it three wins from three at the start of the Serie A season against an Inter side whose opening-day high of a 5-0 win over Torino was followed by a real back-to-earth-with-a-bump of a home defeat to Udinese after taking an early lead.",
      "Juventus haven’t, in truth, been wholly convincing against either Parma or Genoa, but two wins from two games without conceding a goal is never to be sniffed at.",
      "We’ll have a better idea about where both these teams might be heading this season by Saturday evening.",

      "The newly-promoted Lionesses host their first ever WSL match this weekend, with life not getting much easier after a chastening defeat at the hands of Arsenal last week.",
      "There are plenty of reasons to think this weekend might go differently, though. World-record signing Grace Geyoro could come straight into the side, while a thin-looking United squad could well be a touch weary after a 1-0 midweek defeat in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Brann.",
      "That result also leaves Marc Skinner’s side likely to have one eye on the crucial return leg next week and vulnerable to a London City side who will have laser focus and history-making on their mind.",

      "As a defensive midfielder, Luis could have his work cut out against Liverpool on Sunday, just as he does in this woefully-imbalanced XI. But it represents the 26-year-old’s first opportunity to impress while he looks to secure a club-record £20.8million permanent move that Burnley have the option of completing with Benfica next summer. Should he start at Turf Moor against the champions, it would be Luis’s first of the season having come off the bench three times for Benfica prior to his big move.",

Simons has also played for club and country in recent weeks; Kolo Muani has done neither.

However the game is going, though, surely the travelling Reds will get a glimpse of their £125million man in action?",

That’s reportedly the impression he’s given his new team-mates in the few sessions he’s taken part in after returning from an international break with Germany that became a trying experience for the Toon’s record signing.

      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "People will say Amorim has created much of his own mess at Old Trafford with his tactical stubbornness and outspoken, speak-before-you-think nature in press conferences and interviews.",
      "But he is cleaning up an unholy mess left by his predecessor. A mess that was, admittedly, enabled by the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "The new-ish Red Devils hierarchy has already made several mistakes. One was keeping Ten Hag after a worst-ever Premier League campaign in 2023/24. Another might well be picking Amorim as his replacement less than four months after his contract extension.",
      "There may be a vastly different boardroom, personnel-wise, but the same mistakes the old hierarchy made with Ten Hag have potentially been repeated with Amorim. And if his fate is the same, a club in transition could end up in an even bigger mess than the one the Portuguese inherited.",
      "READ: Amorim sent resignation warning as Rangnick the only Man Utd manager of six still standing",
      "In Ten Hag’s first summer at Man Utd, he was backed with a monstrous, club-record transfer window, spending £227million on Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer and Martin Dubravka on loan.",
      "Man Utd had their foreshadowing moments, such as the 7-0 defeat at Liverpool and the Europa League meltdown against Sevilla, but overall, it was a positive first season for Ten Hag, who guided the Red Devils to third in the Premier League, the FA Cup final, and Carabao Cup glory.",
      "The club clearly got giddy and backed Ten Hag with more of ‘his own players’. Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Altay Bayindir, Jonny Evans and Sergio Reguilon all joined for a combined £166million.",
      "Ten Hag was clearly obsessed with signing players he had previously managed, or at least those with Eredivisie experience.",
      "That approach was again evident in a 2024 summer full of uncertainty surrounding his future, as Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui were among those to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fast forward to January 2025: Amorim is two months into the job, not being backed with heavy spending because Man Utd’s hands are tied, but supported with the signing of wing-back Patrick Dorgu — a clear sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his board are buying into their head coach’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Six months, two domestic cup exits, a Europa League final defeat, and a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League later, they did it again.",
      "Amorim was backed with an enormous transfer kitty as the club remained confident in his managerial ability and in a formation that’s still not working.",
      "But while he has been supported with new signings and patience, he has also been tasked with finding solutions for a host of underperforming players signed by his predecessor.",
      "Onana has now followed Ten Hag signings Antony and Hojlund out under Amorim’s watch.",
      "Those are three extremely expensive mistakes. There are suggestions that Ten Hag preferred other strikers, like Harry Kane, over Hojlund, but there’s no doubt the Dutchman desperately wanted Antony and Onana, both of whom he managed at Ajax.",
      "The goalkeeper situation was one Amorim wanted to address in the summer but knew it was easier said than done with more pressing issues in attack and a restricted budget.",
      "A pre-season injury suffered by Onana got the ball rolling, as Man Utd ended up signing Senne Lammens on deadline day, with the 29-year-old falling from first to third choice in just two months.",
      "Signed for a reported £47m from Inter, Onana has now joined Trabzonspor, who finished seventh in last season’s Turkish Super Lig, on a season-long loan.",
      "It’s another catastrophic transfer loss for Man Utd, who thought they were getting a world-class goalkeeper but ended up with one of the most error-prone and least commanding keepers in the club’s recent history.",
      "Amorim might be creating his own mess, but he’s hardly being helped when he has to find new clubs for a bunch of players he knows aren’t good enough, despite costing big money under Ten Hag’s watch.",
      "READ: Man Utd goalkeepers ranked: Onana flops out of top 10 ahead of Turkey transfer",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start ahead of Senne Lammens against Man City in the Manchester Derby on Sunday.",
      "Man Utd forward Joshua Zirkzee is one of the players on Juventus’ list to replace Dusan Vlahovic in Turin, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United squad was ‘relieved’ to see Andre Onana leave the club for one reason, according to a report.",
      "Man Utd are increasingly ‘unhappy’ at how head coach Ruben Amorim deals with certain situations in the media, according to reports."

      "Phil Foden headed City in front inside the first half but Ruben Amorim's side were in the game until Haaland took it away from them in the second half. Jeremy Doku and then Bernardo Silva twice sent him clear and the Norwegian striker did the rest.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma did have to pull off one spectacular save on his Premier League debut to keep out Bryan Mbeumo but Benjamin Sesko struggled for service and for all United's endeavour they lacked the cutting edge that Haaland brings to this City side.",
      "That was proven late in the game as United missed chance after chance. City's win puts Pep Guardiola's side back on track after back-to-back defeats prior to the international break, lifting them above a United side who now have four points from their four games.",
      "In the closing stages, it was the name of Ricky Hatton chanted repeatedly by the home support. News of the boxing legend's shock passing had broken earlier in the day and there were emotional tributes beforehand. He would have enjoyed the result.",
      "Man City: Donnarumma (8), Khusanov (7), Dias (7), Gvardiol (7), O'Reilly (7), Rodri (7), Bernardo (7), Reijnders (6), Foden (8), Doku (8), Haaland (9).\n\n\nSubs used: Gonzalez (6), Savinho (6), Bobb (n/a), Ake (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (5), Mazraoui (5), Dorgu (6), Ugarte (5), Fernandes (5), Mbeumo (6), Sesko (5), Amad (6).\n\n\nSubs used: Mainoo (6), Maguire (5), Casemiro (5), Zirkzee (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Erling Haaland.",
      "This was Foden's first start of the season, having skipped England duty to work on his fitness. There were no signs of his ankle troubles, playing with confidence when deep and still making those forward runs in support of Haaland from a central position.",
      "Doku was the architect of his goal, the tricky winger shifting the ball quickly to break United's back line before finding his team-mate's head with the cross at the second attempt. But there was more to Foden's display than that with silky skills throughout.",
      "A delightful flick to Doku allowed the Belgian to assist Haaland for the key second goal. Foden was not at his best last season after winning the player-of-the-year award in the previous campaign. If he can get back to that level, what a boost that would be for City.",
      "Haaland came into this derby clash fresh from putting five past Moldova for Norway and it was his sharpness that took the game away from United after the break. He could have had a hat-trick, hitting the post when it appeared easier for him to score.",
      "But his two finishes were emphatic, the first of them coming at a time when United were pushing for an equaliser. Haaland has now scored five goals in four Premier League appearances this season, showcasing the sort of firepower that took City to two titles.",
      "Amorim's Premier League win rate stands at 26 per cent. Among managers to have taken charge of at least 20 top-flight games for Manchester United, only Alfred Albut (20 per cent) and Scott Duncan (24 per cent) have a lower win ratio at this level for the club.",
      "Their four points from four games is also their poorest start to a Premier League season since doing the same in the inaugural campaign over 30 years ago. Sir Alex Ferguson's side recovered to win the title that season. Nobody is expecting a repeat of that feat.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "\"I think there will be some pressure applied to the manager and his rigidity of sticking with the system,\" said Neville about the ramifications of the loss to City.",
      "\"City have beaten them well and comfortably. United had some good moments in the game - the first 15 minutes and the first five minutes of the second half. City, in big moments, have had better players. Foden, Doku, Haaland have stood out.",
      "\"There have been times when I have seen United lose this type of match when I feel angry and frustrated.",
      "\"I just feel nothing, which is even worse. This has been a nothing of a performance. United have just been beaten.",
      "\"With Chelsea next week, another defeat and big questions would start to be asked.\"",
      "United have four points from four Premier League games this season - but they have also just picked up 31 points from just 31 Premier League games since Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford.",
      "That is the worst record out of any ever-present Premier League team in that time. Spurs, who finished 17th in the Premier League last season, have leapfrogged them into 16th place this weekend.",
      "West Ham - who have been managed by both Julen Lopetegui and current boss Graham Potter in that time - also have a better record than Amorim's Man Utd.",
      "Amorim now has the unenviable record of having the worst win percentage of any Man Utd boss since the Second World War.",
      "In fact, among managers to take charge of 20+ games with Manchester United in the top-flight, only Alfred Albut (20 per cent) and Scott Duncan (24 per cent) have a lower win ratio at this level in the league than Amorim's 26 per cent (8/31).",
      "United also have huge struggles in front of goal, failing to score in 13 of their 31 league games and finding the net just 36 times.",
      "Amorim has only won four of 26 Premier League games against non-promoted teams since taking charge.",
      "United have won just one of their last 20 Premier League away games against the traditional big six teams, conceding 53 goals in those matches.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
