      "Pep Guardiola will face off with Micahel Carrick this weekend(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola previously hailed Michael Carrick as one of the best players he’d ever seen as the pair prepare to go head to head as managers. Former Manchester United midfielder Carrick is set to be appointed by the Red Devils on an interim basis following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "He beat fellow ex-United star Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the job. The Norwegian was previously in talks but a host of senior Red Devils stars spoke to United chiefs in an attempt to veto his appointment.",
      "That leaves Carrick as the only real candidate and, should he be appointed as expected, he will lead the club into this weekend’s Manchester derby at Old Trafford. The former Middlesbrough boss will attempt to take on Guardiola, who has previously sung Carrick’s praises.",
      "Speaking during the now 44-year-old’s playing career, the Spaniard said: “I am a big fan of Michael Carrick. He is one of the best holding midfielders I’ve ever seen in my life by far. He’s the level of Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets in Barcelona and Munich.”",
      "Carrick will certainly have a job on his hands this weekend in his debut game. Away from his previous caretaker spell at Old Trafford, he has held just one permanent position at Championship side Middlesbrough.",
      "He spent nearly three years at the Riverside, leading the club to the playoffs in his debut campaign. Middlesbrough also reached the Carabao Cup semi-finals during the 2023/24 campaign but was sacked last summer following a disappointing campaign.",
      "Guardiola, in the meantime, is one of the most decorated managers in world football, having lifted six Premier League titles, the Champions League, two FA Cups and four League Cups during his time at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "Guardiola was a big fan of Carrick as a player(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Away from his time with Middlesbrough, this weekend’s clash with City will represent only Carrick’s third Premier League game as a manager. He previously led United in a caretaker spell in 2021 following the sacking of Solskjaer.",
      "He at first secured a 1-1 draw with Chelsea as Jorginho’s penalty cancelled out Jadon Sancho’s opener at Stamford Bridge. Carrick then secured an impressive 3-2 win against Arsenal before handing the reins to Ralf Rangnick.",
      "A Cristiano Ronaldo brace, as well as a goal from Bruno Fernandes sealed victory for United that day.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick has emerged as the favourite to take over as interim manager(Image: PA)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has already expressed his opinion on Manchester United's managerial candidate Michael Carrick, who is now the leading contender for the interim role. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was previously considered the favourite after discussions with club officials, a move that would have marked his comeback following his sacking in 2021.",
      "Further negotiations took place on Monday as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox aim to finalise an appointment. Carrick seems set to clinch the position and could be announced within the next 48 hours.",
      "The club is keen to give their new manager ample time to prepare for the derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on Sunday lunchtime. Carrick stepped up following Solskjaer's dismissal in November 2021, guiding the team to a Champions League victory in Villarreal, a home win against Arsenal, and a draw with Chelsea.",
      "United legend Solskjaer managed the club from 2018 to 2021, ultimately being let go after winning 54 per cent of his 168 games in charge. Before Carrick's potential appointment, Ronaldo had already praised his former Red Devils' teammate.",
      "Back in December 2021, Ronaldo posted on X: \"Michael Carrick was a class act as a player and he can become a great coach as well. Nothing is impossible for this guy. Personally, I'm proud to have played with him by my side as well as with him as a manager on our bench.\"",
      "Carrick has been without a club since leaving Championship outfit Middlesbrough in June. It's anticipated that he will oversee his inaugural training session on Wednesday, before the Manchester derby clash with City.",
      "Michael Carrick coached Cristiano Ronaldo during his caretaker spell at Man United in 2021(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United have secured victory in just one of their previous seven fixtures across all competitions. Fletcher oversaw the 2-2 stalemate with Burnley and the 2-1 FA Cup loss to Brighton on Sunday.",
      "He said afterwards: \"I have to report tomorrow morning (Monday) to Carrington. That's all I know. So I'll find out whatever I need to find out tomorrow morning.",
      "\"I've given it my best, and ultimately, I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result today. But I feel like there were some good things in there, created a lot of chances, shots, things like that.",
      "\"But ultimately it wasn't enough. So I am more disappointed than anybody really because I care for the club and I want the club to do well. I want the players to do well. And I tell you what, it's not about me. I've had my time as a player. It's in the bank now, it was fun. Loved every minute of that. I was very lucky.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has thrown his hat in the ring to join Michael Carrick's coaching staff(Image: The Wayne Rooney Show/YouTube)",
      "Wayne Rooney has thrown his hat in the ring to join Michael Carrick's coaching staff at Manchester United. The Red Devils are poised to appoint Carrick as the club's new interim manager until the summer.",
      "Carrick, 44, first held talks with United board last week following Ruben Amorim's exit, and he has since pulled ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in the running to lead the club for the remainder of the season. With Carrick's appointment set to be confirmed on Tuesday, former teammate and United legend Rooney has offered to help the ex-Middlesbrough boss out as part of his backroom team.",
      "Asked if he would join Carrick's coaching staff, he told the BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show: \"Of course I would. It's a no-brainer. I'm not begging a job here by the way. Just so everyone knows, if I was asked to go in of course I would. Appointing the manager is the most important thing.\"",
      "Solskjaer and Carrick were both seen as the leading contenders to lead United until the end of the season, after United made the decision to find an interim before bringing in a permanent replacement for Amorim in the summer. Former United manager Solskjaer had been the clear favourite to take the role and was interviewed twice.",
      "But he was ruled out when some players went to club bosses and told them they didn't want Solskjaer to come back. It's understood the players made it clear they had little confidence in Solskjaer, and wanted Carrick, who has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough last June, to lead them for the remainder of the season.",
      "Rooney believes that Carrick is a \"great fit\" for the role. \"Whether Michael goes in or if that's Fletch [Darren Fletcher] or John O'Shea or myself, it needs people who know the football club,\" said Rooney, who has recently been on holiday with Carrick and his family in Barbados.",
      "Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick were teammates at Manchester United(Image: John Peters)",
      "\"Roy Keane - I know Roy has had his opinions, I said about Roy going in earlier in the season. Having people who know the club, who care for the club and understand what it takes to be a Manchester United player - that's where the club needs to be.",
      "\"The club has lost its identity, it's lost that family feel, if you like. Whether it's Ole [Ole Gunnar Solskjaer] or Michael, this is an opportunity to bring that back, bring the spirit of Manchester United back to the football club.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher had taken caretaker charge for United's 2-2 draw at Burnley on Wednesday and the 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup to Brighton on Sunday. But he is now set to be replaced by Carrick, with his first game in the dugout coming in the Manchester derby against Manchester City this weekend.",

      "Danny Welbeck once shared the contents of a congratulatory call from Sir Alex Ferguson after his FA Cup heroics(Image: Richard Sellers/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "Danny Welbeck once revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson called him following his FA Cup heroics. The former Manchester United forward received a call from his old manager following his role in guiding Brighton to last year's quarter-finals.",
      "It was Welbeck's extra-time strike that secured victory at Newcastle last season, earning Brighton a place in the FA Cup's last eight. He replicated that success by netting the winner in a 2-1 triumph over his old club at Old Trafford on Sunday.",
      "The 34-year-old broke through United's backline to unleash a ferocious finish into the top corner past Senne Lammens. And whilst Benjamin Sesko maintained his recent scoring streak with a late consolation, Welbeck and Brighton came out on top.",
      "Ferguson, 84, may be less enthusiastic about congratulating his former striker after knocking his cherished United out of the competition. Nevertheless, he has previously demonstrated considerable backing for Welbeck, having handed the forward his senior debut aged just 17.",
      "\"After the Newcastle goal, I think he [Ferguson] was away in South Africa, and he rang me and he was talking about the goal and the performance,\" Welbeck told BBC Sport last year. \"It's 'No caller ID' that always rings, and I was just like, 'Hello?'",
      "\"Sometimes I don't even answer as I don't know who it's going to be, but it was him and he was just buzzing. To have that connection...he's a manager who was always looking out for his players, always wants the best for them, and still to this day we're still in contact.\"",
      "The warmth Welbeck feels towards the boss who gave him his chance at such a young age is evident. The 42-times capped England star lifted the League Cup and FIFA Club World Cup during his debut season as a first-team player before being loaned out by United.",
      "For a brief while, Welbeck appeared destined to become United's star striker for years to come. He notched a personal-best tally of 12 goals across 39 matches for United throughout the 2011/12 season, Ferguson's second-to-last campaign at Old Trafford.",
      "He also secured his sole Premier League title in 2013 as Ferguson himself departed United. Yet despite subsequent moves to Arsenal, Watford and ultimately Brighton, Welbeck's occasional communication with such an influential figure hasn't weakened their bond whatsoever.",
      "The defeat at home to the Seagulls marked the end of United's four-match unbeaten streak. And it may prove to be Darren Fletcher's last match as caretaker manager, with Michael Carrick set to take over as interim boss.",
      "Senne Lammens had little chance of stopping Welbeck's winning strike on Sunday(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "Welbeck's winning goal serves as another stark reminder of the success that former United players often find after leaving the club. While that's not to suggest that Welbeck would be a better fit for the current side, it's worth noting his nine goals this season surpass any tally from a United player so far this term.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is currently leading the squad with seven goals in 16 matches across all competitions this season. The forward has been away at the Africa Cup of Nations but is set to return following Cameroon's exit from the tournament in what could be a much-needed boost.",

      "Ethan Wheatley has returned to Manchester United after a loan spell at Northampton Town(Image: (Photo by Cat Goryn/Shutterstock))",
      "Manchester United have recalled Ethan Wheatley back from his loan spell at Northampton Town, with a new interim manager set to take the reins this week. The 19-year-old striker made a big impact at the Cobblers, scoring three goals and providing four assists in 25 appearances during the first half of the season.",
      "BBC Sport has reported that there's considerable interest in the young forward from other clubs. Given Northampton's current position - fifth from bottom in League One - it seems likely that Wheatley could be headed for a club higher up the league ladder.",
      "However, any potential move may be delayed due to an injury he sustained in a match against Huddersfield in late December. Despite missing the last two league games, he was a regular starter for Northampton, leaving head coach Kevin Nolan both 'disappointed but proud' following United's decision to cut short his loan stint.",
      "Nolan said: \"We are disappointed Ethan has been recalled but we are proud of the work we have done with him and believe he leaves us a far better player than he arrived.",
      "\"I know he enjoyed himself here, I know his family were appreciative of how we looked after him and I know Manchester United were pleased with how the loan went.In that announcement confirming his early exit, Wheatley added: \".",
      "In the announcement confirming his early departure, Wheatley said: \"I have loved my time at Northampton Town. I'm very grateful to the manager and the staff who put their trust in me and helped me every single day, both on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I'd also like to thank the supporters for their backing home and away who have been superb this season. It has also been a pleasure sharing the dressing room with a great group of lads and I wish the club and everyone connected with it all the very best for the future.\"",
      "Wheatley's departure is unlikely to be the sole major decision or announcement made this week, with United anticipated to shortly name a new caretaker manager until the end of the campaign. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick have emerged as the two remaining candidates, with United having held direct talks with both last week, according to the Guardian.",
      "Carrick is set to be appointed instead of Solskjaer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Carrick appears to be the former United favourite who has edged ahead in the running, with some senior squad members reportedly expressing reservations about the prospect of Solskjaer returning for a second stint. Darren Fletcher has occupied the dugout for United's previous two matches since Ruben Amorim's dismissal and was questioned about his own immediate prospects following the loss to Brighton.",
      "He said: \"I have to report tomorrow morning [Monday] to Carrington, that is all I know. I will find out tomorrow morning. I have had zero indications.",
      "\"All my focus has been on this. It is a massive responsibility to lead this club and I have given it my best and I am disappointed not to win a game.\"",
      "Whoever replaces Fletcher confronts a challenging opening period, with the Manchester derby followed by a journey to face league leaders Arsenal at Emirates Stadium. One silver lining for the next manager is that Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be available for selection.",
      "Both Ivory Coast and Cameroon were eliminated at the quarter-final stage of AFCON, while Noussair Mazraoui's Morocco have advanced to the semi-finals.",

      "Former United striker Danny Welbeck sealed the club's departure from the FA Cup fourth round over the weekend. Youngster Shea Lacey was sent off in a disappointing 2-1 home defeat, which saw Welbeck come back to haunt his old employers.",

      "Not only is the England international in a battle to earn game time after slipping down the pecking order in Madrid, but he's also supposedly available at a cut-price fee. However, The Times has reported Aston Villa have stolen a march in the hunt.",
      "Unai Emery's side are believed to be exploring a loan deal for the former Chelsea and Crystal Palace star. However, there's no agreement as of yet, with Atletico supposedly keen for any deal to include a guaranteed £35million purchase option.",
      "That could open the door for United to stake their claim on the player. They may have to agree to those terms or kick up an increased figure up front in order to do so, but the main positive is the door isn't completely shut just yet.",
      "Gallagher, 25, could still represent a significant bargain at £35m in today's market and would address a big need in midfield. Kobbie Mainoo is still hoping to make his way back into the team after being an outcast under Amorim, while Manuel Ugarte is being linked with an Old Trafford exit.",
      "There's also the looming threat that captain Bruno Fernandes could leave in the near future following back-to-back windows being targeted by clubs in Saudi Arabia. However, Villa have the allure of Champions League football and are in the conversation for a Premier League title challenge, something United can only dream of at present.",

Other clubs lived in fear of facing them. But fast forward to 2026, and rival teams cannot wait for the chance to rub United's noses in the dirt again.",
      "A team which can't even beat Grimsby Town. A club which now has a captain, in Bruno Fernandes, who cannot wait to leave. He's had enough. While the climate is so humiliating, the squad will once again be cancelling the end of season prize-giving night.",
      "What's the point in staging such an occasion, when no-one is deserving of an award? People used to raise glasses to United to toast their relentless success. But these days there isn't enough alcohol on the planet for those associated with them to be able to suitably drown their sorrows. From a football club to a comedy club - but no-one inside United is laughing.",

      "Michael Carrick is set to return to Old Trafford(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick looks set to be the man to take the reins at Old Trafford for a second time after the ex-midfielder beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the job as interim boss until the end of the season.",
      "But the Norwegian is now out of contention following talks over the weekend. That has left the door open to Carrick to return to management after being sacked by Middlesbrough in the summer.",
      "It would also signal a return to Old Trafford, having acted as a coach following his retirement, while he was also handed the managerial reins in 2021 for a three-match spell following the exit of Solskjaer.",
      "After the sacking of Solskjaer, United acted quickly in appointing Carrick on a caretaker basis on November 21, 2021. The former midfielder had been a coach under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer.",
      "He enjoyed a dream start, having overseen a 2-0 win against Villarreal in the Champions League. Cristiano Ronaldo had given United the lead late on, with Jadon Sancho securing victory deep into stoppage time in Spain.",
      "Attention then turned to Carrick’s first league game in charge, with Chelsea his first opponents. Sancho was on the scoresheet once more as he gave United the lead at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Carrick is set to be appointed instead of Solskjaer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Is Michael Carrick the right man for Manchester United man? Share your thoughts in the comments section",
      "Ahead of Carrick’s third game in charge against Arsenal at Old Trafford, it was announced that he would be stepping down in favour of interim boss Ralf Rangnick after the match. However, his move was not formalised in time, meaning that Carrick remained the decision maker for the clash with Arsenal.",
      "And it produced arguably his most impressive result, with a 3-2 comeback win. Emile Smith Rowe had given the Gunners the lead at Old Trafford before Bruno Fernandes equalised on the stroke of half time.",
      "Ronaldo then put the hosts ahead shortly after the break, only to see Martin Odegaard level minutes later. United and Ronaldo would not be denied though as he netted once again to secure victory.",
      "Asked what he had learned from his spell in charge, Carrick replied: \"Good question. I think obviously a lot has happened in the last week or 10 days and I've had to certainly adapt and take on a new challenge and some skillsets maybe out of my comfort zone that I've never had to tackle before.",
      "Michael Carrick rounded off his previous caretaker spell with a 3-2 win vs Arsenal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I've enjoyed seeing how I've coped with that at times. You don't know until you're in that situation and you have to learn on the job. I can say, for the most part, I've enjoyed it.\"",
      "He eventually left at the end of his caretaker stint and had 10 months away from football before being appointed by Championship side Middlesbrough. Carrick had just under three years at the Riverside and led the club to the playoffs and a Carabao Cup semi-final spot before being jettisoned in June of this year.",

      "The 40-year-old's arrival was revealed on the social media platform TikTok, teasing the Premier League champion's upcoming first appearance. The announcement showcased clips from Valencia's illustrious playing days, accompanied by the message: \"Soon to be running out at the Avensure Community Stadium very soon [fire emoji].\"",
      "Their starting XI reads like a who's who of the football world. It features recognisable names such as Danny Drinkwater, Emile Heskey, George Boyd, Maynor Figueroa, Oumar Niasse and Papiss Cisse.",
      "Before City's 3-0 victory over Liverpool last year, the national press flocked to cover the club's stunning 13-0 demolition of South Liverpool. In a thrilling top-of-the-table showdown, former Newcastle United player Cisse netted seven goals.",

      "Manchester United have been informed by a former Premier League official that he would have preferred to see Shea Lacey not shown a red card during the FA Cup clash with Brighton. The 18-year-old was brought on just past the hour mark at Old Trafford, but his appearance was cut short after receiving a second yellow card.",
      "His initial booking came from Simon Hooper after a mistimed tackle on Yasin Ayari, with his second arriving shortly afterwards due to his response to committing another foul. After being penalised, he slammed the ball into the turf, prompting Hooper to brandish the red card.",
      "Multiple opinions have emerged regarding the contentious moment, which left Lacey visibly emotional, whilst interim boss Darren Fletcher was incensed by the decision. Mark Clattenburg, who officiated in the Premier League for 17 years, has now weighed in on the major flashpoint.",
      "Speaking via United in Focus, he said: \"Shea Lacey was sent off against Brighton, not for the tackle, but for his reaction at throwing the ball to the ground in disagreement at Simon Hooper's decision. To the letter of the law, it's the correct decision.",
      "\"But it shows how the game has changed. I would prefer the referee to warn the player to calm down and manage the situation.\"",
      "In the wake of United's most recent disappointment, Fletcher commented: \"True character reveals itself in difficult times. You know in difficult times true character is going to show so they have to dig and make sure they want to be part of Manchester United's future.",
      "\"And ultimately, if you're not, then I don't think you should be here or will be here. It sounds strong, but that's just the reality and the way it should be.\"",
      "Addressing the challenges confronting United, Fletcher continued: \"That is where we're at, we can't hide behind that.",
      "\"We've got to face that and we've got to deal with that and it's not Manchester United level or what's expected of Manchester United.",
      "Darren Fletcher was brutally honest in his Manchester United verdict after defeat in the FA Cup to Brighton(Image: Matt West/Shutterstock)",
      "\"The players have to group together, take responsibility. Find a way of improving quickly and taking on the challenge for the rest of the season. Don't waste the season.\"",
      "Fletcher subsequently disclosed he hasn't been informed whether he'll remain in charge for the league encounter against Manchester City, though this appears doubtful given the latest managerial developments.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick were the remaining contenders who could assume temporary control, but it is the latter who appears to have won the race.",
      "As reported by the Guardian, Solskjaer had a meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada over the weekend, but it is Carrick who will be installed as the club's new interim boss after some of United's senior players rejected the prospect of former boss Solskjaer returning to the Old Trafford dugout.",

      "But he was ruled out when some players went to club bosses and told them they didn't want Solskjaer to come back. It's understood the players made it clear they had little confidence in Solskjaer, and wanted Carrick to lead them for the remainder of the season.",
      "United legend Solskjaer managed the club between 2018 and 2021, before getting sacked after winning 54 per cent of his 168 matches in charge.",
      "Carrick's appointment is expected to be confirmed in the next 24 hours following a process led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. It is hoped the 44-year-old will take his first training session on Wednesday, ahead of his first game this weekend when United face a crunch showdown with neighbours Manchester City at Old Trafford.",

      "Danny Welbeck scored to knock Man Utd out of the FA Cup(Image: )",
      "Manchester United's recruitment over the past decade has, rightly so, got pelters for the constant failings, over spending and under delivering of players.",
      "That said, their retention hasn't always been that much better. For so long they were conned by the shiny new thing on the continent, the fashionable name, and so overlooked some of the less flashy players they already had in their ranks. Some whom had come through their own system.",
      "United's spend is astronomical when compared to the lack of success they've had and whilst their shortcomings have often come with squads of players who cost huge sums, in other parts of the country and in Europe players they deemed surplus to requirements have excelled.",
      "On Sunday, for the fifth time in his Brighton career, Danny Welbeck scored against the Red Devils. His strike ultimately dumped them out of the FA Cup as their former player celebrated at the stadium he once called home.",
      "He is one of a number of players who have enjoyed their post-United career. Many have looked on and claimed the veteran frontman could still do a job up top for the Manchester outfit.",
      "Welbeck is just one of a number of players to find that life away from Old Trafford is far more fruitful, but the question remains why were they sold in the first place. We take a look at some of the names to depart Manchester and have since left the club second guessing themselves.",
      "The 35-year-old has never been the easiest player on the eye, but he can more than contribute in the final third, both as a link man but also a poacher himself. He was good enough to be trusted by Sir Alex Ferguson in his final years, yet those who've come after the Scot haven't always agreed.",
      "Sold to Arsenal in 2014, he has scored at Old Trafford on more than one occasion and now finds himself at Brighton via Watford. He's among the top English scorers in the Premier League and has continued to be an example of how United shouldn't look to admiringly at players outside their four walls, whilst undervaluing those they have.",

      "Scott McTominay has been a huge success at Napoli(Image: Getty Images)",
      "For so long deployed in more of a holding position, he showed just what an appetite he had for goals under Erik ten Hag, scoring 10 times. That wasn't enough to keep him though and Napoli came calling - landing him for a mere £25m. Within a year he was a Serie A champion and an icon in Naples. United never seemed to understand what they had.",
      "His numbers alone probably speak for themselves in the years post-United. Signed by Jose Mourinho, fitting the profile of striker he wanted, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had less time for the Belgian and sold him at the first opportunity.",
      "Whilst his return to Chelsea was underwhelming, in Italy Lukaku has won titles with Inter Milan and Napoli, scoring with regularity.",
      "He was at United by his mid-teens but his exit was largely down to Solskajer's inability to read the room. The club had a choice to make regarding when to transition from the ageing David de Gea to Henderson, who had been tearing up trees in a loan spell at Sheffield United.",
      "Dean Henderson won the FA Cup last year with Crystal Palace(Image: Sebastian Frej/Getty Images)",

      "When you look back, the Argentine was perhaps the first example of a culture gone wrong in Manchester. Gary Neville himself has declared it a 'graveyard for players'. Di Maria was signed from Real Madrid off the back of a Man of the Match performance in the Champions League final.",
      "His one year in Manchester was underwhelming and he was sent packing to PSG, where he was again a star. A World Cup winner with Argentina, scoring in the final. Quite how the Red Devils didn't find a way to harness his talent is beyond many.",

      "The very public nature of Manchester United's hunt for a manager is a troubling indication of the club's current state, according to Alan Shearer. The former Newcastle striker is alarmed that the club's search for an interim solution has become public knowledge, pointing to deeper problems at Old Trafford.",
      "United have been in discussions with former players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick about taking the reins until the season's end. Carrick, who last managed Middlesbrough, is reportedly the leading candidate for the role.",
      "Darren Fletcher was given temporary control of first-team affairs after Ruben Amorim's dismissal. The former Scotland international was unable to secure a victory in fixtures against Burnley and Brighton, with United also suffering an FA Cup exit.",
      "Following the defeat to the Seagulls, Shearer delivered a scathing verdict on the team. The former England captain didn't hold back in his criticism of both the players and those running the club.",
      "\"They're just not very good. That's the truth. The whole club, there's so many errors and mistakes,\" said Shearer on the Rest is Football podcast.",
      "Micah Richards responded: \"I am looking here, Mount, Fernandes, Cunha and Sesko as your front four, it's good enough, isn't it?\"",
      "\"It should be, but it's not,\" Shearer replied bluntly. \"It's not a happy place.",
      "\"Fletcher is in there at the moment; he's had Burnley away and Brighton at home and drawn one of those. They've spoken to Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer over the weekend, I gather, in terms of the interim until the end of the season.",

      "\"How does everyone know what's going on? How does everyone know they've been spoken to and that's their plan? That in itself tells me there are issues. How's that getting out?\"",
      "Shearer also remained sceptical about United's tactical shift to a back four following Amorim's departure. He added: \"It turns out it wasn't five at the back that was the problem then?",
      "\"They weren't very good, Brighton were the better team. Danny Welbeck got a goal and an assist. They are what they are, aren't they?\"",
      "Fletcher, currently at the helm, recognises that his players need support to navigate this difficult spell. Yet the United boss also stressed the squad must take responsibility.",
      "\"It's a massive responsibility to lead this club, and I've given it my best and ultimately I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result today,\" he commented after the Brighton match.",

      "Michael Carrick's wife, Lisa, once hit out at Roy Keane on social media(Image: 2022 David M. Benett)",
      "Michael Carrick's wife once slammed Manchester United icon Roy Keane on social media. Former Red Devils player and coach Carrick looks set to become the club's interim boss until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was sacked last week.",
      "Carrick previously oversaw a United defeat by Greek outfit Olympiacos in 2014, and his wife Lisa infamously took to X to hit out at the criticism he received from former United captain Roy Keane.",
      "\"Roy Keane what a **** says anything to provoke a reaction... That's all... Done...\" she posted, before promptly deleting the tweet and replacing it.",
      "She then wrote: \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me... Just disappointed.\" Keane had taken exception to Carrick's explanation for the defeat.",
      "In classic fashion, Keane had said: \"That interview was just like the performance: flat. He should say a bit more, have a bit more urgency, even in his interview. That just reflected United's performance tonight: flat, with no urgency.\"",
      "Yet it's now Carrick who has emerged as the leading contender to become United's head coach for the remainder of the season, after the former midfielder impressed the club during face-to-face talks.",
      "United have been leading the search for a replacement for Amorim and have held discussions with Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, while caretaker Darren Fletcher has also been under consideration.",
      "The former Middlesbrough manager could even be appointed within the next few hours, with United eager to give Carrick ample time to prepare for the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime.",
      "Manchester United legend Michael Carrick could be set to return to the club(Image: PA Wire)",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox were reportedly keen to appoint an interim head coach for the remainder of the season, with Fletcher in charge for the games against Burnley and Brighton.",
      "Carrick met Berrada and Wilcox last Thursday, and Solskjaer held talks with the duo on Saturday. The Norwegian, who managed United for three years between November 2018 and November 2021, quickly emerged as the favourite and has been back in the north west since being sacked by Besiktas in August.",
      "Manchester United legend Roy Keane has been linked with a return to management(Image: )",
      "\"I know he has his critics, but I like what he's done at Newcastle, even at Bournemouth. He's managed 700, 800 games. I like his calmness - I think Man Utd sometimes need a bit of that.",
      "\"I like people with emotion, I'm quite an emotional person, but his calmness, what he's done at Newcastle. Getting them into the Champions League, winning a Cup. I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "Asked if the former Republic of Ireland captain could ever see himself managing United, Keane said: \"No, not at this current time. The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships I have with the people around me. Now, that's not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club. But, at the moment, I am very happy.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim was appointed as United boss in November 2024 before being sacked last week. (Image:  Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United reportedly made an enquiry over Aston Villa manager Unai Emery before appointing Ruben Amorim last season. The Portuguese coach replaced Erik ten Hag in the hot seat at Old Trafford in November 2024.",
      "But after 14 months in charge of the club, he was sacked by the United hierarchy last week. It came following an explosive post-match press conference after the 1-1 Premier League draw with Leeds United.",
      "Since making the decision, United have been on the lookout for a replacement. They have made the decision to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season before making a more permanent appointment in the summer.",
      "Caretaker manager Darren Fletcher has taken charge of the last two matches - a 2-2 draw with Burnley in the Premier League and a 2-1 defeat against Brighton in the FA Cup third round.",
      "United are expected to make an interim appointment ahead of the Premier League clash against Manchester City on Saturday (12.30pm kick-off). Michael Carrick is now the favourite to return to the club, with the former Middlesbrough boss holding more talks today (Monday).",
      "While it seems that progress is being made on the appointment until the end of the season, there is still uncertainty about who may take the reins in the summer. The Daily Mail suggests that Emery may be of interest.",
      "United are reported to have made contact with Villa over the manager before they appointed Amorim. With the Spanish boss continuing to impress, it’s likely that the interest will still be there.",
      "However, there is expected to be ‘obstacles’ to any appointment. Unsurprisingly, Villa will fight hard to keep hold of the manager who has led them to Champions League qualification.",
      "That would make any deal very expensive to complete. It is added that Emery is a manager who likes complete control at a football club.",
      "Manchester United are reported to have made an enquiry for Aston Villa boss Unai Emery ahead of appointing Ruben Amorim. (Image: Vince Mignott/MB Media/Getty Images)",
      "Amorim’s resistance against a lack of autonomy was one of the reasons behind his exit from Old Trafford. It’s therefore likely to need structural changes at United if an appointment of Emery is possible.",
      "Among the other names linked with a potential permanent move to United in the summer are Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, Fulham’s Marco Silva and former Barcelona boss Xavi Hernandez. Reports in Spain suggest the latter may be open to joining United.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo was back in the Man Utd starting XI on Sunday(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick believes there is a place for Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United with the potential interim boss having the chance to bring the midfielder back into the fold.",
      "After months of warming the bench under Ruben Amorim the midfielder was handed a start in the FA Cup loss to Brighton. With the changes in the dugout it looks as if the academy graduate could find himself receiving more minutes than he had done previously.",
      "Amorim's sporadic use of Mainoo had seen him linked with the exit door, but the club had been keen to retain him and with the Portuguese head coach now gone it is almost certain that he will remain. Carrick is the favourite to take charge of the team until the end of the season.",
      "He had a spell as caretaker in 2021, which followed his time as assistant to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The former United midfielder claimed in the summer that Mainoo's connection to United makes him a huge asset.",
      "Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that has come through the academy, knows the club and feels it - that's massive. To have a talent like that, as he's already shown, you've got to say: 'Right, he gets it, he knows it - let's help him, build on him, and stick with him. I think there's definitely a place for him.\"",
      "United have been linked with midfield reinforcements - which was something Amorim wanted but never got in his tenure. Before he was axed it was clear that the team needed more legs in the middle of the pitch, with the 3-4-3 formation often seeing the Red Devils outnumbered in midfield.",
      "They were linked with the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, but ultimately landed no one. They have also been eyeing up Wolves' Joao Gomes, but he is now being targeted by Napoli as the Italians look to raid more Premier League talent.",
      "Joao Gomes is a target for Manchester United and Napoli(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Napoli had been keen on Mainoo amid talk of a loan move. But United's decision to refuse any offers for their academy star has led the Serie A outfit to turning their attention to Gomes, reports the Daily Mail, as he continues to be a bright light in what is a struggling Wolves side.",
      "Wolves boss Rob Edwards has already claimed that the club will be open to doing the right business - even if it means players leaving. When quizzed on striker Jorgen Strand Larsen he said: \"I just said that every good player we have at the moment, there will be interest. If it’s right for the football club we will see, but at the moment there is nothing to talk about. He is showing his commitment to the football club.”",

      "Scott McTominay played a starring role in Napoli's draw against Inter Milan(Image: AP)",
      "Hindsight is great in life and even better when it comes to analysing mistakes in the transfer market. There is not a club out there who has not been made to look slightly silly by parting with a player who then goes on to be a roaring success elsewhere.",
      "And the truth is that, under several managers, Scott McTominay was not an automatic starter, far from it. But in his last season with Manchester United, McTominay scored ten goals and made three assists in 43 appearances across all competitions.",
      "And whenever he was on the pitch, he was a powerful presence. Whatever you thought about his limitations, it was impossible to deny his indefatigability and his commitment.",
      "Again, hindsight is a wonderful thing and as much as McTominay was mainly popular with United supporters - not least because he showed fantastic determination to come through the ranks - no-one could have anticipated him being Player of the Year in his first season in Serie A. Few could have imagined him being such an important cog in Napoli’s title-winning machine.",
      "Few could have imagined his sale turning out to be somewhere close to the equivalent of Liverpool letting Steven Gerrard go. On a weekend when Danny Welbeck again scored against United, on a weekend when Marcus Rashford won his first medal for Barcelona, McTominay - after his mistake gave the home side a lead - was again inspirational for Napoli in a 2-2 draw at Inter Milan, scoring both goals.",
      "The 29-year-old’s performance was greeted with unanimous acclaim by the Italian media. Over in Saudi Arabia, Rashford was enjoying Barcelona’s win over Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup final but he had only been brought on as an 83rd minute substitute.",
      "Marcus Rashford has celebrated winning his first honour as a Barcelona player (Image: Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "And there is no way Rashford has been given a rough deal by United. If anything, he has been indulged down the years.",
      "Just because Rashford is enjoying his time at Barcelona does not mean United have messed up by letting him go out on loan. It is easy to be revisionist. That applies in the McTominay case and even more so in the Welbeck timeline.",
      "There might have since been a case for buying him back at some stage but when Welbeck was sold, he had a lot of high-quality strikers ahead of him at Old Trafford. But the relative success of Welbeck and, in particular, McTominay elsewhere, does highlight what United - regardless of coaching and executive failures - appear to be missing.",
      "Danny Welbeck scored the second Brighton goal in their FA Cup win at Old Trafford(Image: )",
      "Character, spirit, an infectious attitude. These are qualities that come instinctively from the player, not from the manager. They are qualities that seem to be in short supply at United right now.",
      "That might change. The new signings from the summer look mainly made from the right stuff, for example.",
      "And in August, 2024, most observers considered £25million to be a decent fee for McTominay. In August 2024, most observers would not have had McTominay down for finishing 18th in the 2025 Ballon d’Or voting. But his drive and commitment in Naples - and in Milan at the weekend - shows just how standards at United are slipping.",

      "Michael Carrick has emerged as the leading contender to become Manchester United head coach for the remainder of the season after the former midfielder impressed the club's powerbrokers during face-to-face talks.",
      "United have been leading the search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and have held discussions with Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, while caretaker Darren Fletcher has also been under consideration.",
      "But it is Carrick who looks set to win the race and he could be appointed within the next 48 hours, with United keen to give the new man time to prepare for the derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on Saturday lunchtime. Chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox are set for more talks on Monday as they aim to finalise an appointment.",
      "Amorim was sacked a week ago and Berrada and Wilcox quickly resolved to appoint an interim head coach until the end of the season, while putting Fletcher in charge for games against Burnley and Brighton.",
      "Carrick met Berrada and Wilcox last Thursday and Solskjaer held talks with the duo on Saturday. The Norwegian, who managed United for three years between November 2018 and November 2021, quickly emerged as the favourite and has been back in the north west since being sacked by Besiktas in August. That seven-month spell in Turkey is his only job since leaving Old Trafford.",
      "It was Carrick who stepped in when Solskjaer was dismissed, leading United for three games before stepping down from a coaching role when Ralf Rangnick was appointed until the end of the season. The 44-year-old former United man oversaw a Champions League win in Villarreal and an Old Trafford success against Arsenal, along with a draw with Chelsea.",

      "Carrick is the leading contender for the interim job.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "Four years after stepping down as Manchester United caretaker and declining the chance to coach alongside Ralf Rangnick, Michael Carrick is preparing for another crack at the job.",
      "Carrick has emerged as the frontrunner for the interim position for the remainder of the season after impressing during his interview. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also been in contention for the role and United are expected to formally announce who will assume the position in the next 48 hours.",
      "\"It's Carrick, you know, it's hard to believe it's not Scholes,\" was aired at Turf Moor last week. United fans are disillusioned with Ineos' decision-making, and they are set to protest against the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe before facing Fulham, but Carrick is guaranteed to receive strong support from matchgoers.",
      "The former midfielder is hugely popular and only enhanced his reputation during his caretaker stint, in which he oversaw wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, and a draw against Chelsea. Rangnick was appointed as interim to oversee the second half of 2021/22, and Carrick declined the opportunity to continue as part of his coaching staff, partly out of loyalty to Solskjaer.",
      "“It is 100% my decision,” Carrick said at the time. “I respect a new manager coming in. I made the decision before speaking to him. It wasn’t an easy one but [it is the] right decision for the club. The loyalty to Ole is a little bit of a factor, but there were a lot of things that came into my decision.",
      "“I was conscious of making my decision before any real conversations with Ralf. It was nothing personal at all. He’s got a good group of players to work with. I’m proud of the players over the past three games. I just told them and they were a bit shocked and surprised, a bit emotional in the changing room.”",
      "Carrick was asked what he would do next. “I can honestly say I’ve given it no thought. Take the kids to school then we’ll see,” he said. “My time at this great club will always rank as the best years of my career.”",
      "Carrick has unfinished business at United.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "In management, what Carrick did next was take the Middlesbrough job in his native north east. He guided Boro to the play-offs in 2022/23, but was sacked in June 2025 after eighth and tenth place finishes.",
      "Carrick worked with limited resources at Middlesbrough, who have played just one season in the Premier League since their relegation in 2009, and it felt like his tenure had run its course.",
      "There is a feeling that Carrick has unfinished business at Old Trafford. And he should give himself a pat on the back for declining to work with Rangnick in 2021, as he wouldn't have been considered for the job in 2026 if he'd been part of the German's disastrous coaching staff that season.",
      "Carrick decided to walk away from a campaign that was about to unravel with Rangnick in charge. The irony is that he could walk into Carrington with this season threatening to unfold in the same manner.",
      "The 41-year-old's first game if he lands the job will be against Manchester City, followed by a trip to Arsenal. It doesn't get much trickier than playing the Premier League's pacesetters.",
      "United could slip into the bottom half of the table if results don't go their way. They have already exited the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, and the campaign would become bleak if hopes of securing Champions League football are dashed before mid-February. Carrick will be desperate to make a quick impact.",
      "Carrick dropped Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge.(Image: 2021 Getty Images)",
      "He is a winner and was popular among players during his coaching stint, which should help him. Bruno Fernandes was a close ally and will act as a sounding board if Carrick is formally announced.",
      "The Newcastle-born boss has demonstrated his ability to make big decisions, which is another plus. Carrick had the courage to drop Cristiano Ronaldo at Stamford Bridge in December 2021 and intelligently disarmed the media when he played down the significance of the decision after that game.",
      "\"I didn't see it as being a major decision,\" he said. \"It certainly wasn't within the camp or group. We all got on really well. The game went well to an extent and it wasn't a drama at all.\"",
      "It's those kinds of decisions that a United manager must make with conviction to be successful. Carrick is not afraid to axe players from the team and he should be able to give the current crop a kick up the backside.",
      "United looked like they needed a jolt against Brighton last weekend. Darren Fletcher described the group as \"fragile\", and a club source recently questioned the mentality of those in the dressing room.",
      "Carrick was part of various United dressing rooms over the years with no concerns about mentality. He will need every bit of his coaching experience to secure a spot in the Champions League this season.",

      "Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have both managed Manchester United in some capacity(Image: IAN KINGTON, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United opted for Michael Carrick as interim manager after some players rejected the idea of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returning to the club, according to reports.",
      "Carrick will assume control until the season's end, marking his second interim tenure in charge. He oversaw the club for three matches in the 2021-22 campaign, winning two games and drawing one.",
      "Solskjaer had been the frontrunner to replace the recently dismissed Ruben Amorim - who was relieved off his duties 24 hours after his explosive press conference which proceeded the 1-1 away draw with Leeds United - and was interviewed twice for the position.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, it's been claimed many of the current crop of players were not enamoured by the idea of the Norwegian taking over again. According to the Mirror, the former United striker was ruled out when certain stars expressed their lack of confidence in him to club officials, stating they did not want Solskjaer back.",
      "Reports understand the players made it clear they preferred Carrick to guide them for the rest of the season. Solskjaer, a United legend, managed the club from 2018 to 2021, before being sacked after winning 54 per cent of his 168 matches in charge.",
      "Carrick's appointment is expected to be confirmed within the next 24 hours, following a process led by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "The 44-year-old is anticipated to conduct his first training session on Wednesday, ahead of his inaugural match this weekend when United face local rivals Manchester City at Old Trafford in a crucial encounter. This will be a challenging initiation for Carrick, with United having secured just one victory in their last seven matches across all competitions.",
      "Many United players expressed their doubts about Solskjaer returning, according to reports(Image: OLI SCARFF, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "The ex-midfielder was put in charge as interim manager shortly after Solskjaer's dismissal. He secured two victories and one draw in those matches, before departing following the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager.",
      "He has been without a job since being dismissed by Championship side Middlesbrough in June. Carrick guided Boro to the Championship play-offs in the 2022-23 season, only for them to be defeated by Coventry in the semi-finals.",
      "His team then narrowly missed out on the top six in consecutive seasons, leading to Carrick's dismissal. The former England midfielder made 464 appearances for United and clinched 18 major trophies, including the Champions League title in 2008.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough in June(Image: Neal Simpson/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "He joined Jose Mourinho's coaching team at United after retiring at the conclusion of the 2017-18 season. When Mourinho was sacked, Carrick remained as a first-team coach throughout Solskjaer's 168-game tenure.",
      "Darren Fletcher has managed United in their last two matches following the dismissal of Amorim. The under-18s coach presided over a 2-2 draw with Burnley in the Premier League before Sunday's 2-1 loss to Brighton in the FA Cup third round.",

      "Rooney is convinced Carrick represents an ideal choice for the position. \"Whether Michael goes in or if that's Fletch [Darren Fletcher] or John O'Shea or myself, it needs people who know the football club,\" former Plymouth and Birmingham boss Rooney said, having recently holidayed with Carrick and his family in Barbados.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's future at Manchester United has been in doubt for several months(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been tipped to stay at Manchester United beyond the January transfer window after months of speculation about his future. Mainoo has previously been linked with a move away from United this winter after spending the majority of the season on the bench.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s departure as United head coach last week has led to rumours that Mainoo may not be heading for the exit door at Old Trafford before the February 2 deadline.",
      "United handed Darren Fletcher the job on an interim basis, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick being linked with being appointed on a caretaker basis until the end of the season. Carrick is understood to be leading the race with the former midfielder close to agreeing a return.",
      "There had been rumours suggesting that Mainoo could leave United on loan this window in order to get more minutes, but that could be about to change.",
      "Transfer expert Gianluca Di Marzio has claimed that United may not look to part ways with Mainoo before the deadline after Amorim’s exit, with Napoli previously being linked with a move for the midfielder.",
      "“I think things will change for Kobbie Mainoo after this,” Di Marzio told AceOdds.com. “I hope Man Utd make another mistake like they did with [Scott] McTominay and [Rasmus] Hojlund. Players that were not performing at Man Utd are top performers at other teams. It's good for us in Italy and Napoli.”",
      "“In Italy, we say, ‘there is no two without three’. So obviously Napoli said after McTominay and Hojlund, we’ll try to get Mainoo too.”",
      "“With a new coach I don't think they'll try to sell Mainoo and will try to give him more minutes.”",
      "The view of Mainoo being more likely to stay at Old Trafford is shared by United legend Dwight Yorke, who has explained why he thinks staying at the club would be the best move.",
      "“Would I go on loan if I were Kobbie Mainoo? I've never been on loan, when you hear players go on loan,” Yorke told PokerScout.",
      "“Even as a young kid, the club never allowed me to go on loan. That's when you kind of realise how good you were.",
      "“Normally a young kid who's not playing, you go on loan, but they didn't allow me to go on loan. So that speaks volumes. I had no other ambition but to be the best until over that period of time, and I managed to accomplish that.”",

      "Dalot reacted after the FA Cup defeat.(Image: MUTV)",
      "Diogo Dalot believes Manchester United must improve their defensive record. United crashed out of the FA Cup on Sunday evening after losing 2-1 against Brighton at Old Trafford. The defeat means United will play 40 games this season, their fewest in a campaign for 111 years.",
      "Michael Carrick is the leading candidate to take interim charge of the team for the remainder of the season, and the former midfielder will try to steer the club into the Champions League places. United have conceded 36 goals in all competitions this season. The Reds have recorded just two clean sheets in the Premier League, and Dalot believes the defensive record is a clear area for improvement.",
      "Speaking after the Brighton defeat, he told MUTV: \"Really difficult to take. The last couple of games, you try to find ways to win the game, and I think we did enough to win, but in the end, it's really frustrating because in the second half, we gave them so few chances to score goals, and we created enough to win, and we controlled the game.\"",
      "When it was put to Dalot that United continue to concede goals despite conceding few shots on target, he said: \"I think that's something we have to look at. We are in the phase where every attack they have is a threat to us, we are conceding so few shots on target.",
      "\"But we concede one goal at least every game. I still believe we're going to score every game. We are a threat, but when it's time to defend, we need more urgency as a team.\"",
      "Carrick is expected to land the interim job, which means his first game in charge will be against Manchester City this weekend. City are winless in their last three league games but are still in second position.",
      "\"Not just the leaders, but the whole group,\" said Dalot about how United must respond. \"You have to find ways to overcome this, to find energy between each other to come to training, be professional and prepare for a big game.\"",
      "United will be boosted by the return of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo for the Manchester derby. The pair will be available for the first time since reporting to the Africa Cup of Nations with their respective nations.",

      "Manchester United's defeat to Brighton and Hove Albion in the fourth round of the FA Cup was particularly disappointing for the club. With the Premier League realistically out of reach, the famous competition was the last chance for silverware this season for the Reds.",
      "With that now out of the window too, United must focus solely on the Premier League to offer themselves a chance of success. As such, the incoming interim head coach will be looking to play his strongest possible team available to him in the remaining fixtures of this season to put United in the mix for Champions League qualification.",
      "There will now be little room for rotation and three players are going to be the biggest losers in that scenario. MEN Sport has therefore taken a look at the trio who are set to suffer the most by the FA Cup exit.",
      "The United winger was sent off against Brighton on Sunday. The 18-year-old will learn from this experience. Lacey may well be given further opportunities this season but they are likely to be few and far between without the FA Cup. Bryan Mbeumo is back from the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) this week, as is Amad, so the teenager is dropping down the pecking order by the minute.",
      "The FA Cup would have allowed for more experimentation and rotation but dropping out of the competition will see Lacey miss out on chances to start.",
      "On paper, the move away from 3-4-2-1 should be good news for Fletcher. United will open up another central midfield position with Fernandes playing further forward again in attacking midfield.",
      "But in practice, the teenager is going to find himself lower down the order with fewer matches to come. When everyone is fit, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and Fernandes will be the three players playing centrally.",
      "Fletcher is in a prime position to replace Mainoo when necessary but considering the lack of minutes Mainoo has had in the first half of the season, and the fewer opportunities to rotate, the current boss' son will be the one missing out more often than not.",
      "Similarly to Fletcher, Ugarte is in a position where he is the second choice to Casemiro. Out of the trio, he has the most chance of taking that position back.",
      "Against Burnley, it was Ugarte who stood out ahead of Casemiro and he got the nod to play in the FA Cup against Brighton. But he was flat against the Seagulls and the Brazilian will win his place back for the derby.",
      "Everyone knows Casemiro struggles with two games in quick succession but there is only one more midweek matchday remaining for United now. Without the extra FA Cup fixtures, the Uruguayan will have to wait patiently for another shot.",

      "Lacey looked like a player worthy of wearing the famous No.7 shirt in the future when he came off the bench at Turf Moor on Wednesday night. The youngster came close to making a fairytale cameo, but that appearance in Lancashire should only be the start of his next chapter.",

      "\"I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game. I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "United have exercised patience with Lacey, who has struggled with muscle injuries, and the youngster deserves credit for staying determined to reach the first-team despite his progress having stalled.",
      "Lacey has been forced to watch as academy peers have been given their debuts over the last 18 months. United wrapped him up in cotton wool to protect him, and that foresight should now pay off.",
      "Lacey came close to scoring against Burnley.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "The youngster has carried a huge reputation within youth circles since he was a boy. For some, expectation and pressure are too much, but Lacey got his head down and stuck to his task.",
      "Ruben Amorim praised Lacey for his exemplary behaviour, which comes from his strong family grounding in Merseyside. The importance of hard work and staying humble was drilled into him from the start.",
      "At Turf Moor, he acknowledged a fan before getting on the team bus. A few years ago, Lacey went out of his way at Carrington, going back inside the building to gift boots to a fan.",
      "Lacey often took time to take photos with fans at Leigh Sports Village after academy fixtures and signed autographs before leaving the ground. The signature requests might be about to skyrocket this year.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his senior bow against Aston Villa in the Premier League last month, and Tom Heaton gave him words of encouragement as he prepared to come on from the bench.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made a beeline for Lacey when he didn't get a chance to make his debut against Wolves at Molineux. United were leading 4-1, and it felt like the perfect moment for Lacey to come on. However, he had to bide his time and was rewarded at Villa Park just a few weeks later.",
      "Harry Maguire, who is represented by the same agency as Lacey, has also provided the youngster with advice. There is recognition from senior players about his quality and potential.",
      "Fernandes speaks to Lacey at Molineux.(Image: 2025 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's rare to find someone who was born in Liverpool who supports United, but the youngest of three brothers, Shea is that anomaly. Lacey once had a season ticket at Anfield, but his middle brother, Luis, would complain that he wasn't interested in watching Liverpool.",
      "\"I can’t go from hating Liverpool in the morning when I’m playing against them, to supporting them,\" Lacey told his family, referencing how it felt to represent United's academy.",
      "Lacey's father is the reason he chose to join United's academy over Liverpool when he was just a boy. Shea's oldest brother, Paddy, came through Liverpool's youth system, despite his father telling him that Manchester was the best place for him to develop due to the better coaching.",
      "Neil Harris, former United academy coach for two decades, now a coach educator, spoke to the MEN this week and reflected: \"Shea was always cheeky, funny, mature when he was a boy, and he could hold his own with his coaches when it came to having fun. He was very mature for his age.",
      "\"As a footballer and a young player, he was exciting, and obviously being left-footed, he was always aesthetically pleasing when you looked at him. He could go past players and loved nutmegging people.",
      "\"The shot he did against Burnley, cutting in from the right, all the wonderful coaches who have worked with him down the years, we've seen that strike from Shea a thousand times.",
      "\"He loves cutting in and curling the shot into the top corner. Stuart Leicester at Ashton on Mersey on a Thursday, he would continually practice that shot with Shea whenever we worked with him.\"",
      "Lacey has spent over 10 years at the academy.(Image: )",
      "Harris continued: \"He always played with no fear. If something didn't come off on the pitch, he would just try it again. There would be no beating himself up, he wouldn't show any frustration, and he would just do it again. He had that arrogance about him - in a hugely positive and elite way.",
      "\"He's an exciting talent, and we're all hoping he kicks on now to the next stage. Hopefully the club give him time, but it would be exciting to see him play at the weekend in the FA Cup. He's a great kid, with a great family behind him, with wonderful brothers and mum and dad. We're dead proud of him.\"",
      "Those who know Lacey best noted he was probably the most frustrated they've seen after the final whistle at Turf Moor. A stunning last-minute winner from an academy graduate in Fletcher's first game as caretaker? Lacey's oldest brother was watching from the away section. It would have been perfect.",
      "Lacey was inches away from a special moment, but that would have spurred him on during sessions at Carrington this week as he trained hard in an attempt to win a place in the starting XI.",
      "The youngster must be under consideration to make his full debut at Old Trafford this weekend. Lacey is the kind of player worth paying an entry fee just to watch in person.",

      "Manchester United will soon be able to call upon Bryan Mbeumo again(Image: Visionhaus/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup at the third round stage having lost 2-1 to fellow Premier League side Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford.",
      "United, under the watch of interim head coach Darren Fletcher, were hit by goals from Brajan Gruda and former United striker Danny Welbeck either side of half-time. Benjamin Sesko bundled the ball over the line in response, but with 85 minutes gone it was always going to be an uphill struggle to find a way back into the tie.",
      "Shea Lacey was then sent off - shown a second yellow for venting his frustrations with referee Simon Hooper's decision regarding a foul - and the afternoon ended in the ultimate misery of elimination from the cup.",
      "It leaves United, who will name a permanent successor to Ruben Amorim after the season's end, out of both domestic cup competitions, with no European football, and only a top-six Premier League finish to play for.",
      "For that sole purpose Fletcher - or whoever is interim manager for the remainder of the campaign - will want a number of absent players and restore the squad to full strength.",
      "United's injury list has actually depleted in recent weeks, leaving just Matthijs de Ligt the only individual sidelined. In his case this has been due to a back problem since November, though the central defender does not yet have a return date outlined.",
      "Meanwhile, Lacey's red card on Sunday means he will have to serve a one-match suspension. The 18-year-old will miss next weekend's Manchester derby at Old Trafford and only becomes available again for the January 25 trip to face Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Following on, United have three more absentees who have represented their countries at this year's Africa Cup of Nations since December - Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "The tournament has advanced to the semi-final stages, which are to be played on January 14. Both Amad's Ivory Coast and Mbeumo's Cameroon were eliminated at the quarter-final stage.",
      "It means the two attackers should return and become available for the clash with Manchester City on January 17.",
      "As for Mazraoui, he and AFCON hosts Morocco are part of the last-four and will play Nigeria for a place in the final. Regardless of the outcome, the full-back will only be available for United's meeting with Arsenal on January 25 because the losers of the semi-final will contest a third-place play-off on January 17, with the final scheduled for January 18.",

      "Referee Simon Hooper shows a red card to Shea Lacey in Manchester United's miserable FA Cup exit to Brighton at Old Trafford(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Simon Hooper was correct to send off Shea Lacey for his act of dissent during Manchester United's FA Cup third-round elimination at the hands of Brighton & Hove Albion, says Keith Hackett, the former head of refereeing body PGMOL.",
      "The 18-year-old had been introduced as one of Darren Fletcher's second-half substitutes and rippled the top of Brighton net shortly before Benjamin Sesko's 85th minute goal brought United back into the cup tie at 2-1 behind.",
      "A full fightback was not to be for the home side, who now only have Premier League football to play for the remainder of the season. Heaping more misery on the FA Cup exit was Lacey's sending off.",
      "The forward had been booked by referee Hooper for the first in the 87th minute for bringing down Yasin Ayari. Two minutes later, he did the same to Ferdi Kadioglu.",
      "Although the second foul was not deemed a second bookable offence itself, Lacey reacted by throwing the ball in anger and this was the action that earned his dismissal.",
      "In review, former PGMOL chief Hackett told Football Insider: \"Simon Hooper is correct in cautioning this rather petulant action which, of course, was a clear act of dissent.",
      "\"Hopefully the player will not do it again,\" he added about the United teenager from Liverpool, who was visibly distraught with the sending off in just his third senior appearance for the club.",
      "Lacey protested Hooper's decision before making his way off the field. He pulled his shirt over his face as he approached the Old Trafford tunnel, and television cameras caught the youngster kicking a wall in further frustration over the incident.",
      "After the dust had settled, the United player took to Instagram to post an apology to the club's supporters. He wrote: \"I want to apologise to all of my teammates staff and the fans [sad pensive face emoji]. I let everybody down tonight I shouldn’t let my emotions get the better of me I will do everything I can to make this right [praying emoji].\"",
      "Lacey will now serve a one-game suspension as a result of receiving two yellow cards in one outing. Because these carry across English domestic competitions, it means he is ruled out of next weekend's Premier League Manchester derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford on January 17.",
      "The 18-year-old will next be available for selection for United's trip to the Emirates Stadium, where they will play league leaders Arsenal, on January 25.",

      "Darren Fletcher at Turf Moor.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Darren Fletcher refused to be drawn into whether he is the obvious choice to manage Manchester United on an interim basis for the remainder of the season. Fletcher has assumed caretaker duties following Ruben Amorim's sacking and oversaw the Burnley game on Wednesday night.",
      "Fletcher spoke to the media on Friday afternoon ahead of facing Brighton in the FA Cup third round, which could be his final game in charge before an interim appointment is made. United have held discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick this week over the vacancy. The Norwegian was sacked by Besiktas in August, and Carrick was axed by Middlesbrough in June.",
      "Fletcher was asked whether he was surprised that he wasn't the obvious job to manage for the remainder of the season. \"No, I was surprised I got offered for the two games because I wasn't expecting it,\" he said. \"I don't think like that. I think about the job that I've got in hand. I really do, and so it wasn't something that was on my radar at all, but when I do get asked to do it, I know that I can do it.",
      "\"I know that I'm comfortable doing it. I know the environment, I believe in myself. I feel like I've learned a lot in the five years that I've been here. I've had great experiences as a player. I've taken my time to develop and learn as a coach and other parts of things off the field, which I'm glad I've done because I think it's put me in a great position now, or a better position now than it would have been five years ago.",
      "\"So I've had five years of learning under good coaches and good people. As I said, I feel like I've developed a rounded approach to the game and football and (am) comfortable in a lot of different situations, academy, technical or obviously coaching and leading.\"",
      "When it was put to Fletcher that he seems like the obvious candidate to lead the team on an interim basis, he responded: \"Maybe, yeah. I appreciate you saying that and but honestly, it's two games. I'm the obvious choice for these two games. Thankfully, an amazing opportunity, but that's all my focus and energy is going on just now anything beyond that is out of my control.\"",
      "Discussing how he has found the experience, he added: \"I've always been quite relaxed about my future. I've enjoyed it. I really have. I've enjoyed the challenge of it and and it's amazing. I've tried to relish it.",
      "\"I've tried to go with my instincts as I said, I think I'm quite well prepared. And. I've always tried to prepare myself to be a manager in the future was something I always thought that I would maybe be quite good at or something that I'd enjoy doing, or enjoy the challenge of.",
      "\"But at the same time, I wanted to be really careful and make sure I was ready for the moment, but it's not something I'm saying I'm desperate to do. I think circumstances in life dictate that, where you're at yourself personally. Health, family, lots of different factors dictate that.",
      "\"And I've got two young boys at the start of their football career. I've got another set of young twin girls which takes up a lot of my time. So those things are on my mind. I've experienced how intense it has been a manager for less than a week.",
      "\"So yeah, there's not much time for much outside the family life and things outside the football. I want to prepare myself to be a manager and that opportunity might come for me one day.",
      "\"I know I'll be ready to do it. But if it doesn't (materialise), I'll be more than comfortable with that, and if it remains staying as the under 18's coach, I'm really happy, I enjoy doing that, and I'm going to help develop players for Manchester United.\"",
      "When Solskjaer was appointed as interim United boss in 2018, Fletcher made an appearance on BBC Radio 5 Live and said: \"United should never be in this position. They're almost writing the season off.\"",
      "When asked whether his stance had changed, Fletcher smiled and responded: \"Good research, that. I was young and naive when I said that, wasn't I? And no, that was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is it's not my decision, and ultimately, the club need to do what they think's best, the people in the higher up in the roles in the club.",
      "\"They need to do what they think is best. They need to know what their plan is going forward for the success of Manchester United. And I'm sure they'll do that. I think that they'll be strong enough to think to to do.",
      "\"To accept and to deal with that pressure and to make the right decision for what's best for them and for what Manchester United is just now.\"",

      "Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup against Brighton on Sunday afternoon.",
      "United fell at the first hurdle in the Carabao Cup to Grimsby Town, and another disappointing defeat against Brighton means they will play just 40 games in all competitions this season.",
      "The Reds came into the game on the back of a 2-2 draw with Burnley on Wednesday. There were positives to take from Turf Moor, but Brighton drew first blood at Old Trafford in the first half of the game.",
      "Former United striker Danny Welbeck netted to extend Brighton's advantage. Benjamin Sesko scored with five minutes remaining to give hope of forcing extra time, but Shea Lacey was shown a second yellow card.",
      "Recap what happened at Old Trafford here.",
      "At some point this week, a Manchester United great will ride back into Carrington and look to rescue a season that has hit rock bottom.",
      "Surely it can't get any worse than this. Fans of nostalgia will remember Mick McCarthy's iconic response to a press conference question along similar lines. \"It can,\" came the droll response. They are certainly fans of nostalgia around these parts and it's Manchester City and Arsenal up next.",
      "United's cup endeavours are over for another season, embarrassed by a team from the east coast and humbled by one from the south coast. This is a team all at sea. Darren Fletcher's chances of being the white knight are almost certainly over after his team were beaten by a smarter, slicker and more streetwise Brighton.",
      "Defeat in the FA Cup third round means United will play just 40 games this season and they have lost at the first hurdle in both cup competitions.",
      "This season is turning into an annus horribilis, but then so do most of them at Old Trafford these days. A trawl through the record books is difficult in the search for easy comparisons, but 1981/82 was the last time they went out of both cups at the first hurdle.",
      "Read the full report here.",
      "Senne Lammens: One horrible moment with the ball at his feet in the first half, when he was lucky he wasn't punished. Did at least shrug it off well. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Early miss set the tone. Struggled defensively and got decisions wrong in the final third. Brighton got a lot of joy down United's right. 4",
      "Leny Yoro: In no man's land for both goals and his form is becoming a major concern. Just not alert enough at times to deal with danger and not aware of what's going on around him. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Handed the corner kicks and twice went close from shots in the opposition area, but struggled with the movement of Brighton's attackers. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Moved to another new position and deserves some sympathy for that, but poor defensively. Lost sight of Gruda for both goals. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Passing continues to be a major weakness and United need more from their No.6. His days are numbered. 4",
      "Read the full player ratings here.",
      "That's the final whistle at Old Trafford.",
      "There will be no silverware this season.",

      "Sesko scores a header from a corner and we suddenly have a game on our hands.",
      "Casemiro and Maguire ON.",
      "Ugarte and Martinez OFF.",
      "There were positives to take from the Burnley game, but this has been regression from United.",
      "Lacey beats his man down the right and plays a wonderful cross to Sesko in the box. That was oldschool wing player from the youngster. Fans around the press box jumped to their feet to applaud the move.",

      "Making the right runs but needs to time them better 6",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Fletcher needs to have words during the break because this has been poor. Brighton made six changes to their team today, but they are leading at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes just screamed in frustration as his pass to Sesko failed to be controlled by the centre-forward. There was a little bit too much on it, meaning Sesko had little chance of latching onto the pass.",
      "United’s right side is malfunctioning at the moment. A lot of the play coming over this way, but Dalot been poor and Mount struggling with the width. Kadioglu also really exposing Mount when it comes to running in the other direction. It’s a strength for Brighton at the moment.",
      "United are struggling to build up from the back because Brighton are so well-coached.",
      "Brighton almost played all the way through United from their goalkeeper, but Dorgu recovered to thwart the danger. Dorgu has been in decent form over the last few weeks and has started well again today.",
      "United made a really quick start to the game, creating a handful of chances, but have faded.",
      "That is a disastrous goal to concede for United. The space and overload against Dalot was worked so easily and the marking in the middle was poor as well. They had started so well but that is basic stuff. Lucky not to concede a second with some poor distribution from Lammens. Suddenly rocking here and need to steady the ship. They have to get better defensively.",
      "I'm not sure what was going on down that flank. Brighton were given far too much space and time. Fletcher is watching a replay of the goal alongside Binnion on the bench, trying to work out who was responsible. Mount was pulled out of position and Dalot was left totally exposed.",
      "Brighton have taken the lead through Gruda at the Stretford End.",
      "Fletcher turned around to his bench and shook his head.",
      "\"We want the Glazers out,\" is the chant currently coming from the Stretford End.",
      "It felt like United would start games very passively here under Amorim, there was a strange lack of tempo and intensity, but they’ve come flying out the blocks today. No surprise under a head coach like Fletcher, who had the shackles off on Wednesday, but it has immediately got the crowd into it as well.",
      "Fletcher applauds Mainoo for dropping in between the defenders, picking up the ball from Lammens and turning. Mainoo is brilliant at that - he provides the team with an outlet to play from the back.",
      "Huge chance for Dalot but his finish was tame and straight at Steele.",
      "It was a gorgeous ball from Cunha, who picked the ball up from deep."

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",

      "Carrick and former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer were the two candidates considered for the interim role, but the club’s hierarchy ultimately decided against bringing the latter back to Old Trafford after holding talks with both.",
      "Carrick was sacked by Middlesbrough at the end of last season following a 10th-place finish in the Championship, while Solskjaer was dismissed as Besiktas boss in August after the Turkish club exited both the Europa League and Europa Conference League during the qualifying rounds.",
      "The 44-year-old previously served on Solskjaer’s coaching staff and, following the Norwegian’s sacking in November 2021, stepped into a caretaker role himself. Carrick oversaw wins against Villarreal in the Champions League and Arsenal in the Premier League, as well as a draw with Chelsea.",

With Carrick, however, they are getting a more tactically astute coach and someone who commands respect in the dressing room, having won five Premier League titles as a player at Old Trafford.",

      "MEDIAWATCH: Is everybody still ‘thronging around’ Darren Fletcher after that defeat?",
      "Still, appointing an interim manager for six months is familiar territory. The previous board did the same with Solskjaer, then again with Rangnick, before Erik ten Hag was eventually appointed on a three-year contract in April 2022.",
      "Solskjaer was outstanding during his interim spell, winning 14 of his 19 matches, but the wheels came off after he was handed the job permanently.",
      "Rangnick’s tenure, meanwhile, was a disaster. Part of his agreement involved moving into an advisory role at the end of the 2021/22 season, but even that failed to materialise after Ten Hag decided he did not want to work with the German.",
      "This latest appointment feels like another disaster waiting to happen.",
      "That said, appointing Amorim mid-season proved to be a bigger calamity than any permanent managerial decision since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement in 2013.",

Last summer, he was tempted by an enormous offer from Saudi Arabia, which he rejected out of sporting conviction. He wanted to continue competing at the highest level.’",
      "That latest report comes hot on the heels of a story claiming Fernandes has ‘decided to leave’ this year, while a report from Hooligan Soccer said last week that Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal are preparing a new £100m offer for the Man Utd captain.",

The bid is reportedly $135M (£100 million), and Fernandes would receive a $810K (£600K) per week wage.

This is due to their ‘perceived advantages’, which include ‘their proven track record of success, Champions League pedigree, and the allure of working under one of football’s most respected tacticians’.",
      "Were Man City to actually make a serious play for Anderson in the summer, the outcome of this saga would be the same as the Semenyo situation; Man Utd would miss out on a key target.",

      "Forest have repeatedly stated no interest in selling in January, emphasising their desire to retain key assets amid their push for a stable Premier League position.",
      "Other clubs, including Chelsea and Bayern Munich, remain in the conversation, but the narrative increasingly frames this as a potential City-United showdown. With City’s midfield requiring fresh legs to complement stars like Rodri (as he returns to full fitness), Anderson represents a strategic long-term investment.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. When that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Seven wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",
      "That Brentford now sit a whole six points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 10 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton, it’s now five points from their last three games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games, and suddenly Wolves find themselves as close to West Ham as West Ham do to safety.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are still absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But he’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in nine games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like seven points away.",
      "",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes is reportedly finding Ruben Amorim’s departure tricky to get over as the Red Devils receive a huge deal for his serviced.",
      "The Tottenham board are “split” on the future of Thomas Frank with some concerned the head coach is “not a good fit” for Spurs, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "An insider account has revealed that some Tottenham stars feel Thomas Frank is ‘waiting to be sacked’ by the club, where there he will earn around £20million.",
      "A Tottenham journalist how long he feels Thomas Frank has left at the club as they are “dysfunctional” and his “lifeline is getting shorter and shorter.”",
      "Spurs were almost entirely awful for all but five great second-half minutes against Aston Villa – and that will keep Thomas Frank in gainful employment."

      "Fletcher is reporting to Carrington on Monday morning to hear what Manchester United have in mind for the rest of the season. Reports suggest Michael Carrick has emerged as most likely to take over.",
      "He may not have won any games, losing to Brighton after a draw at Burnley, but Fletcher’s brief reign wasn’t a dead loss. There were some positives to take despite the bleak overall outlook.",
      "Handily for features like these, we’ve counted five…",
      "",
      "Mainoo v Amorim was in danger of becoming 2026’s Pogba v Mourinho, especially while the midfielder’s idiot half-brother was hellbent on milking his sibling’s exile for all the attention he could.",
      "Still, it was very clear that if Amorim remained in charge, Mainoo was finished. The manager did not trust the England star to play at the base of his midfield and he was way down the pecking order for the more advanced positions. A parting seemed inevitable…another academy product sold off and most likely to go and be a huge success elsewhere.",
      "But Amorim’s exit makes that prospect far more remote. There is a role for Mainoo in a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, but the 20-year-old still has plenty to prove after almost a lost year.",
      "Upon returning from injury for the first post-Amorim game – convenient timing, that – Fletcher has given Mainoo the platform to build upon for the remainder of a season that may be all-but finished for the club, but the next 17 games are crucial for the player.",
      "",
      "Funny though it would have been to see Fletcher stick with a back three after Amorim, the interim-interim boss was never going to pass up the easiest win imaginable by reverting to a back four.",
      "Not only to highlight a contrast between himself and Amorim; a back four simply suits the players at his disposal despite the previous manager’s desperate attempts to shoehorn them into a 3-4-2-1.",
      "Especially the full-backs. Had Amorim stayed, United would have needed at least one, probably two new wing-backs. Literally all those who have played in the position over the last year are more comfortable as full-backs.",
      "It times of struggle, it is always easiest to revert to what comes natural and we would be stunned if any of United’s defenders have grown up more used to a three than a four. These Red Devils evidently don’t catch on quick (ask Ralf Rangnick), so it makes complete sense to simplify things, and the principles of defending in a back four are less taxing on the brain.",

      "MORE: Michael Carrick next? Man Utd have snubbed one of six best caretaker managers",
      "",
      "Another easy win, especially at Old Trafford, can usually be achieved by throwing in a kid. Fletcher resisted the temptation to do that with his sons but threw in Lacey, an 18-year-old who has been tearing it up in the academy.",
      "That is not to say that Fletcher promoted Lacey ahead of time for his own ends; the teenager has earned his promotion. But Fletcher has clearly been more willing than Amorim to facilitate it.",
      "Coming off the right flank, Lacey was bright against Burnley, almost scoring a stunner with his first senior touches, and against Brighton, it was evident his senior team-mates trust him. Of course, his two yellow cards were stupid and United have to hope it serves as a steep learning curve. But Lacey has whetted the appetite for more cameos through the remainder of the season.",
      "To ham up his association with the academy and all that represents at United, Fletcher could have included 15-year-old JJ Gabriel in his squad for Brighton. That he didn’t is a positive. At least let the lad finish school before throwing him into the circus ring.",
      "",
      "Sesko has been a tough watch since he arrived from RB Leipzig for around £70million in the summer. He’s certainly not the only big money striker to arrive from abroad and take some time to settle, but the Slovenian’s confidence appeared to be draining to dangerously low levels.",
      "That’ll happen when you don’t see the ball. Granted, there have been times when it has been slung his way and he’s been shrugged off it too easily for a lad of 6’5″, but far too much of his involvement in United’s play was far too far from the opposition goal.",
      "That seemed to change against Burnley. Not only did he score twice, doubling his tally through the first 16 games in one night, but there was undeniably a greater emphasis on finding Sesko around the box. His two goals came as a result of seven shots on target – the most any player has managed in a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Another goal though ultimately inconsequential followed against Brighton, with his three goals all different finishes: a first-time volley to meet a cross; a one-v-one after a run in behind; and a header from a set-piece.",
      "Whoever comes in needs to make sure Sesko retains a similar supply line that Fletcher has laid for the centre-forward.",
      "",
      "United’s search for a new manager is obviously their most pressing business. But their skipper’s situation needs plenty of attention too.",
      "Reports suggest he’s had enough of United’s s*** and fancies getting away in the summer. You cannot blame him. Fernandes has been brilliant for United since he came through door in 2020 and perhaps only after he leaves will his contribution be truly appreciated by some.",
      "From United’s perspective, hopefully there is still time to show Fernandes that it doesn’t have to be this bleak because literally no one would trust the club to replace his record-breaking creativity – he’s created double the number of chances of any other United player – in a summer when they are preoccupied with a manager.",
      "On that, Fletcher has made a positive start simply by playing Fernandes in a position closer to his best. Under Amorim, he had to play at the base of the midfield and he made a decent fist of things. But United – and Sesko – need him closer to the opposition goal.",
      "Against Brighton and Burnley (he played only an hour upon return from injury) in attacking midfield positions, Fernandes created five chances in each game, above his season average of 3.3 per 90. At Turf Moor, his withdrawal and United’s loss of control was no coincidence.",

In other words, they can’t actually be that bad. But everyone tells them they are, all of the time. It has to be demoralising for a previously highly-rated player. Certainly every bit of skill, decent pass etc, seems immediately followed by a clumsy error.",

It may be a low bar to qualify as United’s best player but it’s not sensible to alienate him and treat him like a prime cut of beef to be sold at a premium. Only to compound their idiocy, they don’t actually sell him, leaving a man on the books who feels disrespected and the team’s confidence on the floor. Stupid at every turn.",
      "It really is like literally every single thing they do is wrong and everything they think is wrong, though West Ham might have something to say about terrible ownership.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "The task of running the club is patently beyond them. They got so big in the successful years that it was a wild dog; they thought if they just kept feeding it red meat, it would never turn on them and they would never need to have a plan B. Obviously they don’t know what they’re doing and are making fools of themselves. But they see themselves as competent execs being let down by the players. It must be galling for the staff.",
      "As an example of some of the worst contemporary management styles, they can’t be beaten, frequently making terrible decisions that any of us could warn them against. Jason Wilcox has got a lot wrong and yet is kept in a job. What would he have to do to be dismissed? And what next? Install Tim Sherwood as club hairdresser?",
      "The players have to perform with clown cars bursting into flames all over the place, all of the time. Is it any wonder things sank to a nadir and have barely recovered? It’s clear to everyone that the problems with everything stem from this idiotic ownership. You can’t expect a team to perform well in a toxic atmosphere which is telling them they’re rubbish. Admittedly, they are rubbish, but they said that about Rasmus Højlund and he’s transformed at Napoli, which is hardly a model of stability. United is a curse for players that cannot be lifted.",
      "Every poor performance is another humiliation, not just a mid-table team losing. And the poor performances aren’t just narrow losses. Like against Brighton, they’re played off the park and look totally deflated.",
      "Obviously, playing staff isn’t the problem. They can play well, but not for United. They’re not useless wasters, even if United seem to have turned them into exactly that. Until the entire ownership goes away, the problems will continue. But history suggests they’ll keep throwing money at it to ever-decreasing effect and the players will continue to be booed for the failures of amateur executives who’ll continue to say nothing. As an example of how not to run a club, they are in a league of their own.",

      "According to reports, Darren Fletcher could soon take up a new role at Manchester United, who have placed a manager in ‘pole position’.",
      "It is now a week since the Red Devils decided to part ways with former head coach Ruben Amorim, who exited the club following a disastrous 14-month reign.",
      "Amorim‘s position became untenable after he appeared to fire shots at club chiefs over an apparent lack of support, while he faced heavy criticism over his failing formation and shambolic performances.",

      "However, the situation has changed in the last 24 hours as several outlets are reporting that Carrick has overtaken Solskjaer in the running.",
      "This has now been confirmed by The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell, who claims Carrick is in ‘pole position’, while Fletcher could soon take up a new position.",
      "Whitwell explains: ‘Carrick has emerged as the leading candidate after he and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer held face-to-face talks with club executives. Darren Fletcher, in caretaker charge for two games following Ruben Amorim’s sacking, is in line to potentially assist Carrick as a coach. It is thought another coach coming in to support Carrick would also be on the cards.",
      "‘United insist no final decision has been made, but an announcement is anticipated in the next 48 hours. Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada have led the process to appoint an interim head coach, with sign off required by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family.’",
      "A report from The Sun, meanwhile, has shed light on why Solskjaer has not been favoured for the interim role, with certain individuals at the club ‘miffed’ by the club legend.",
      "The report claims: ‘Sources say Solskjaer has “bunkered down” over the last week, having been widely visible since he relocated to England’s north-west after he was sacked by Besiktas in August.",
      "‘Some figures at United were slightly miffed at the noise that quickly grew around Solskjaer, who has had one job in management in the past four years.’",
      "Man Utd have chosen tactics over vibes but are treading familiar ground with the appointment of Michael Carrick, who will reportedly join this week.",
      "Two factors have reportedly contributed to Manchester United opting to favour Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the interim manager’s role.",
      "‘Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford’. Has he though?",
      "Darren Fletcher was unable to part the dark clouds above Old Trafford, but the interim-interim manager has achieved some little victories, if no actual wins…",

      "Man Utd‘s transfer business has generally been dire over the past few years, but their business in the summer was positive as they got a lot right.",
      "The Red Devils managed to offload most of their deadwood on their terms, while they spent around £230m to sign Senne Lammens, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Each of these signings have made a positive impact this season, with Sesko improving in his last two matches by scoring three goals.",
      "Sesko had been prematurely written off before this upturn, though it remains whether he can reach his potential at Man Utd.",
      "The 22-year-old has been put in a difficult position as he’s been tasked with leading Man Utd’s attack without enough back-up, with Hargreaves explaining why this is a recurring problem for the club.",
      "READ: Man Utd fans plead for Wilcox sack after season ends v Brighton",
      "“He’s a threat, he’s shown that and I think there’s so much room to improve. Physically, he’s got some amazing traits. I think he’ll get better and better. But the onus shouldn’t just be on Benjamin Sesko to score goals.",
      "“Back in the day, United had four or five strikers. You think about Andy Cole, Dwight Yorke, Teddy Sheringham, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Then they had young lads coming through: Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, [Carlos] Tevez.",
      "“It shouldn’t just be Benjamin Sesko, a young man still learning his trade. We saw that with Rasmus Hojlund and how that ended, he’s on loan.",
      "“So you’ve got another young lad that’s trying to bear the burden of scoring all the goals and I think that’s a lot for one, young player.”",
      "Despite this, Hargreaves thinks Man Utd “should” qualify for the Champions League this season, though they have one “biggest issue” to overcome.",
      "“They are only three points off fourth, they should get Champions League football,” Hargreaves added.",
      "“They are the only team in there that doesn’t have any European competition. They’ve got one game a week, they can be well rested, they can work on things on the training pitch. I genuinely believe they should.",
      "“They have enough firepower; they are the third-highest scorers. They concede too many goals. That is the biggest issue they have. So going to a back four might help. But I do think they have the personnel to finish in the top five, and I think they should with the personnel they have.”",
      "Pundit Tim Sherwood has explained why he thinks Manchester United summer signing Benjamin Sesko is “not good enough” for the Premier League giants.",
      "Man Utd refused to buy seven players requested by Ruben Amorim during the Portuguese head coach’s time at the club, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford is now ‘highly likely’ to return to Man Utd in the summer after Ruben Amorim was sacked by the Premier League club, according to reports.",

      "United‘s captain is the only world-class asset in their current squad, and he can certainly hold his head high for his individual performances as the club has remained a shambles.",
      "Despite this, Fernandes was heavily linked with a transfer in the summer as he was targeted by Saudi Pro League clubs and Man Utd were reportedly open to his sale to raise funds for their rebuild.",

      "Now, a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Fernandes has ‘decided’ that he ‘will leave Man Utd at the end of the season’.",
      "It is claimed that his ‘breaking point’ was reached on Sunday as Man Utd lost 2-1 to Brighton to exit the FA Cup, with the midfielder leaning towards an exit because the club has ‘list its way’ and his ‘priority’ is ‘sporting’ rather than ‘financial’ as he could continue playing in Europe instead of the Middle East.",
      "Man Utd could also sell Marcus Rashford this year as he has surpassed expectations during his loan stint at Barcelona, who have a buy option worth around 30 million euros (£26m).",

      "“Marcus would be more than happy to stay at Barcelona. Both sides want to continue together. Now it’s going to be technical and financial, and it will take some time.",

      "It looks very much like Manchester United will opt for Michael Carrick over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the caretaker role.",
      "It’s bold because Solskjaer has form; we rate his previous stint in charge as one of the best best spells in football history.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nSolskjaer was a surprise choice to step in when Jose Mourinho burned his bridges at Manchester United in December 2018. His senior management credentials consisted of a couple of spells at Molde in Norway around a failed tenure at Cardiff.",
      "But United didn’t need tactical acumen and complex man-management nous, apparently. All that was required was a big smile, an abundance of positivity and endless references to 1999 to lift the Mourinho fog.",
      "Solskjaer was due to return to Molde at the end of the season but United stumbled upon the next Sir Alex Ferguson when they appointed their former striker. Or so it seemed from the Red Devils’ form. Under Solskjaer, the Red Devils went unbeaten for a dozen Premier League games, winning 10, before a stunning fightback to beat PSG in the Champions League last 16.",
      "So giddy were United after that night in Paris, they gave Solskjaer a three-year contract. Which was hardly the wrong call at the time. We all egged them on.",
      "But, alarmingly quickly, it all went to sh*t. Solskjaer’s players reverted to type, taking their foot off the gas to win only two of their last 12 games.",
      "Solskjaer’s two full seasons in charge brought third and second-placed finishes, but never did he convince the majority that he was the right man for such a prestigious position. His third campaign was a disaster, leading to the sack when United dropped to eighth with an appalling defeat at Watford. United appointed another interim, Ralf Rangnick, but the players paid due attention for roughly 12 minutes.",
      "He wanted to repeat the trick after the sacking of Ruben Amorim but it seems the club has chosen Michael Carrick instead.",
      "",
      "Roberto di Matteo\nChelsea were fifth in the Premier League, three points behind the top four – and were still in two of the other three competitions open to them – when Andre Villas-Boas was sacked at the start of March in 2012. In relative terms, this was not even close to a crisis. But at a club that had not finished outside the top three during Roman Abramovich’s ownership, panic buttons were pressed far more readily.",
      "Villas-Boas’s assistant was subsequently thrust into the limelight. Di Matteo won his first four games in charge, including a famous 4-1 victory over Napoli in extra time of their Champions League last 16 second leg, and a crushing 5-2 win over Leicester in the FA Cup quarter-final. He would go on to beat Tottenham 5-1 in the semi-final and Liverpool 2-1 in the final to lift one trophy, but that was only the half of it.",
      "After the thrill of the Napoli tie, Chelsea strode past Benfica comfortably in the quarter-finals. Against all odds, Barcelona were beaten in a Gary Neville orgasm-inducing semi-final, before Bayern Munich found the Di Matteo tidal wave irresistible in the final. From caretaker to history-maker, Di Matteo had finally delivered Abramovich’s holy grail, 18 months after being sacked by West Brom.",
      "Chelsea handed a full-time contract to the Italian in the summer, unable to part with a man who had finally guided them to Europe’s summit. He was sacked within the first three months of the following season.",
      "",
      "Tony Barton\nDi Matteo was only following in the footsteps of Tony Barton. Appointed caretaker manager of the flailing but reigning First Division champions in February 1982, Aston Villa’s former chief scout made enough of an instant impact to be given the permanent job within a couple of months.",
      "Barton oversaw no miraculous improvement in league form, taking Villa from a relegation-threatened 17th to a safely mid-table 11th. But again, it was in Europe where he conjured magic from nothing. By the time Dynamo Kiev were beaten in the European Cup quarter-finals, Barton’s future in the hotseat was still far from certain.",
      "Two weeks after that success, Barton was given a three-year contract. But the honeymoon had only just begun: Tony Morley laid waste to Anderlecht in the semi-finals, before Peter Withe helped slay Bayern Munich in Rotterdam. Having begun the season with no prior first-team coaching experience, he ended it inflicting Bayern’s first ever defeat in a European Cup final.",
      "Villa simply couldn’t keep that remarkable pace. They finished sixth the following season, reaching the quarter-finals in defence of their European crown. After coming tenth in 1983/84, Barton was sacked and soon fell by football’s wayside, with Villa themselves suffering an ignominious relegation three years later.",
      "",
      "Glenn Roeder\nNewcastle were floundering in February 2006. With just six points separating them from the bottom three, the Magpies were compelled to act; Graeme Souness was sacked, the Scot blaming a 12-year-old Paul Pogba for his demise.",
      "His replacement was the unassuming, wholly unqualified Glenn Roeder, promoted into a role as Batman to Alan Shearer’s Robin with a remit to make St James’ Park great again.",
      "A five-game unbeaten run was ended with three consecutive defeats in March, as the club continued to struggle for consistency. But six wins in their last seven games lifted them into seventh, and meant that Roeder won ten of his 15 league matches in charge, compared to Souness’ seven wins in 23. Yes, he was given the permanent job. Yes, he barely lasted a full season. There’s a theme here.",
      "",
      "Guus Hiddink\nChelsea have a history of successful caretaker managers. One season after Di Matteo guided them to Champions League glory, Rafael Benitez completed the set by winning the Europa League. They combined to provide the filling in a Guus Hiddink sandwich.",
      "Chelsea were mired in fourth-placed crisis when they pulled the trigger on Luiz Felipe Scolari in February 2009; they would go on to finish third, win the FA Cup and lose a ‘f***ing disgraceful’ Champions League semi-final against Barcelona under Guus Hiddink. They found themselves in actual dire straits when he returned for a second stint in December 2015, but the Dutchman took them from one point outside the relegation zone to mid-table comfort.",
      "Hiddink has been Chelsea manager for 49 games in all competitions, winning 26 and losing just seven. He still holds the record for longest unbeaten start to a Premier League tenure with 12 games in 2015/16.",
      "",
      "",
      "Kenny Dalglish\n‘Such is Liverpool’s transformation under Dalglish, a reinvigorated team now sixth, it can only be a matter of time before he is confirmed as long-term manager,’ wrote Henry Winter after a 1-0 win for Liverpool over Chelsea in February 2011. ‘Martin Kelly’s vibrancy, defending hungrily and attacking with pace and persistence, rivals Meireles in embodying the new model Liverpool under Dalglish.’",
      "It was a weird time. As Roy Hodgson was busy picking fights with Frank Rijkaard, signing Milan Jokanovic, losing to Northampton Town and admitting Liverpool were “in a relegation battle” as early as October, the spectre of Kenny loomed. The Scot returned to Anfield in summer 2009 in a role at the club’s academy, but would soon find himself steering a sinking senior ship.",
      "Liverpool were 12th when Hodgson was sacked and replaced with Dalglish in January 2011 – the club legend’s first managerial role in 13 years. They lost their first two games but an eight-match unbeaten run restored some pride on Merseyside. A 3-1 win over Manchester United, assisted by the worst hat-trick in Premier League history, saw the Reds finish strongly in sixth.",
      "Dalglish was rewarded with a three-year contract in May 2011, but his permanent reign is less fondly remembered. He was sacked after just one full season that included two cup finals, an eighth-placed finish and a misguided, regrettable defence of actual racism from one of his players.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after draws against Leeds, Fulham and Arsenal. And now Xabi Alonso is available…",
      "Arne really hasn’t handled the slings and arrows of Our League’s outrageous fortune particularly well this season.",

I also wrote that I don’t think he has been helped by “Handsome Hughes” changing half the team. Allow me to explain a bit further.",
      "Last year, as soon as we won the ball, a defender would look to Diaz or Nunez for a quick break; a ball over the top or down the line was often the option. If that wasn’t on, VVD would look for the cross-field ball to Salah. However, with those two quick outlets now gone, and the resulting change in style, these options are no longer available.",
      "The slower transition has led to a more congested midfield, which in turn has negated last year’s other outlet: the drilled pass into Gravenberch, allowing him to turn the press and glide through the centre of the park.",
      "With Slot putting Frimpong wide and high on Thursday, the team finally seemed to rediscover a bit of last year’s mojo. Yes, there were no shots on target, but Frimpong’s pace and directness forced Arsenal to drop deeper in the second half. This, in turn, gave Gravenberch and Mac Allister space to pass between the lines and break the press, something we had not managed for several months.",
      "I only hope that Slot recognised this and keeps Frimpong higher up the pitch despite Bradley’s injury. Sometimes, playing a lesser player in the correct position, while keeping the other ten in their natural roles, is the better option. I am reminded of when we lost all four centre-backs five years ago and played the inexperienced Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams. Keeping them at centre-back allowed Henderson and Fabinho to remain in midfield and helped us secure a top-four finish.",
      "Speaking of the top four, I am heartened by Man United reverting to type when trying to find a solution to their 253rd crisis since Sir Alex left. However, if I were on the interview panel and a candidate mentioned “Fergie” and DNA, I would thank them, end the interview, and reject them out of hand. Sir Alex is a legend, one of the best managers of all time. He deserves his stand, a statue, and everything that comes with it.",
      "But hearing that interims, caretakers, and members of the Class of ’99 still seek his advice, permission, and even refuse to park in his space is embarrassing. Guys, it’s been 13 years. Bill Shankly was asked to stop coming to the training ground because of his status. In Klopp’s first interview, he said (circa) that the weight of history is like a backpack, it needs to come off. United (and I am quite happy that they are) are choosing to carry this Fergie-sized bag.",
      "Onto another example of sycophancy. I am surprised that so little has been made of the atrocious coverage of the Arsenal–Liverpool game on Thursday. I don’t think Liverpool were praised as much for winning the league as Arsenal are for being six points clear. The noises from Nevillier and the fawning adjectives pouring from the a$$-chapped lips of Drury were embarrassing. The producer and director also spent more time showing the Lego Sith Lord than I have seen devoted to other managers combined this season.",
      "This continued, unwarranted flattery is one of the reasons the club, in general, behaves so appallingly. The manager demands, and receives, respect he has not yet earned. A reminder to the suck-ups: he has spent close to a billion pounds and has one FA Cup and three second-place finishes in a beauty contest to show for it. Being constantly told you are brilliant and the best has fuelled Arteta’s ego and afforded him a level of impunity, evident in his touchline antics.",
      "Persistently operating outside his technical area, instructing his players to slow the game down at set pieces (then complaining when others do the same), and, in one instance, dragging an injured player back onto the pitch to time-waste sends a message to his squad. This is why I think Martinelli acted as he did. It is learned behaviour from the one person at the club who should know and act better. A few years ago, F365 ran an excellent comparison of Klopp and Arteta; it may be worth dusting off for a new generation.",
      "So I am torn. I don’t believe Liverpool or Villa will win the league, which leaves a choice between this Arsenal side or Man (115) City. Which of the two would be the least soul-destroying?",

      "Because you sure as hell can’t claim that you genuinely have the interests of the fans at heart? Surely?",
      "In 2017/18, Spurs were better than Liverpool. Since then they’ve won 2 league titles and a champs league. In 2019 Villa were in the championship and Spurs were in the champions league. Now look at them.",

You have had some world class footballers and not built around them. You currently have some footballers who actually seem to care. They’re as angry as the fans. But you have a manager who despite being a nice fella, is a bit of a doughnut. Micky Van der Van does not like or respect Thomas Frank. It’s clear. That isn’t the basis for a successful team.",

      "United fought their way back with an 85th-minute Benjamin Sesko strike – his third in two games – but could’t mount any more pressure on Brighton, with youngster Shea Lacey’s late sending off not helping them in that respect.",

      "“The second goal knocked the stuffing out of them. There’s no real belief in this team.",

      "Out of the cup and, if reports around their managerial search are to be believed, Manchester United are completely out of ideas.",
      "Darren Fletcher’s two-game spell as the interim-interim manager concluded with the Red Devils’ first ever FA Cup defeat to Brighton. Which sounds stark, but the wrong context in which to view this latest defeat. The Seagulls have now won four of their last five visits to AmEx North. Losing at home to Brighton is just one of those things that Manchester United do.",
      "Not to worry, though, Reds because here comes Ole Gunner Solskjaer and/or Michael Carrick. Just what this situation needs: another blast from the past.",
      "It worked before, right? At least until it didn’t. Solskjaer swept in at the end 2018 and powered by little more than sunshine and smiles, enticed a string of results from a squad that decided it cared little for the standards demanded by Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer lost one game in 17 – even that defeat to PSG provided the platform for a stirring fightback in Paris – which got him the permanent job. The United legend took Mourinho’s team from sixth in December to, at the end of the season…. sixth.",
      "Still, given how tight the Premier League is this season, a similar run now would go a long way to securing a Champions League place. Which Jason Wilcox reckons is achievable. Especially since literally nothing else is.",
      "That may be one reason Wilcox feels that, right now, United need a shot in the arm of nostalgia. More likely, the director of football believes that United fans will be more uncomfortable showing their dissent if one of their own is back at the wheel.",
      "Wilcox, not for the first time, would be wrong. Fletcher’s past glories could not spare him boos at half-time and full-time today from a fan base that isn’t likely to be fooled again by the novelty. The Stretford End have Wilcox and Sir Jim Ratcliffe in their sights and no one on United’s roll of honour will serve as a human shield big enough to spare them the flak.",
      "They will do it anyway, because what else can they do? Few would back the United brains trust to find a suitable manager in the six months between now and the summer. In a week? No chance.",
      "There is an important difference too which Wilcox may well have missed: this group is not as good as the group Solskjaer inherited from Mourinho.",
      "A few months before Mourinho lost the dressing room, he drove them to a runners-up finish in the Premier League. As they showed under Solskjaer, when the whim took them, that squad could play.",
      "This one, by any measure, is not a very good team. For a long time it was believed that they were being held back by Ruben Amorim and his weird devotion to a system that was never going to work at Old Trafford. And that was certainly a factor. But as we’ve seen in the week since the Portuguese was axed, a change of shape cannot compensate for an inability to consistently get the basics right.",
      "This Manchester United is a moments team. For good and bad. And the bad will always render the good a wasted effort.",
      "We saw it before 15 minutes had ticked over at Old Trafford. In the Brighton box, United created a couple of big chances, one for Diogo Dalot and another Benjamin Sesko, that were struck straight at Jason Steele, one of six changes made by Fabian Hurzeler to United’s three. This was hardly the Seagulls’ stiffs, but still.",
      "Defensively, United allowed Brighton the freedom of their box to take the lead. Fault could be found across the back four for not getting close enough to avert danger, or even sniff it. It is a recurring problem among these United players: the lack of willingness or capability to deny opponents space, perhaps assuming that everyone else is as wasteful as they are.",
      "Confidence is low, sure, and that will be a factor in the attacking flaws. Defensively, though, the easiest way to take encouragement is by winning duels and battles. United too often take the approach that you can’t lose the ones you don’t enter.",
      "We have heard lots on United’s ‘DNA’ this week, a concept so loose that no one can really define it. Indisputably, it features youth, and one of the few wins this week were the cameos of Shea Lacey. But he and United even managed to turn that into an L.",
      "United’s support urged the players to find Lacey on the right after the 18-year-old replaced Mason Mount and, always eager to shirk responsibility, his senior team-mates were happy to oblige. Lacey again went close to a first senior goal before he showed that the self-sabotage streak runs down from the first-team to the academy.",
      "A poor tackle earned him his first caution on 87 minutes and, two minutes later, he reacted angrily to another foul given against him, slamming the ball to the floor. United may wish that Simon Hooper took a more lenient view, but what else could the official have done? In the modern game, it is as clear a caution as you can see.",
      "Of course, it won’t be held against the kid and nor should it be. Pre-match, Fletcher was talking about JJ Gabriel a 15-year-old also tearing it up in the youth teams. But there is no saviour coming though the ranks no mater how hard United cling to that particular comfort blanket.",
      "Instead, Wilcox will probably choose to let Solskjaer, United’s emotional support dog, run free in the hope of boosting morale at Old Trafford. But vibes won’t fix this United.",
      "A club so big cannot possibly write off the rest of the season. But they almost already have. Each action and every game between now and May will just be a box ticked before yet another great summer reset, led by men who have proved hopelessly incapable of even recognising one.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after draws against Leeds, Fulham and Arsenal. And now Xabi Alonso is available…",
      "Arne really hasn’t handled the slings and arrows of Our League’s outrageous fortune particularly well this season.",
      "Manchester United’s worst fears appear to have been realised when it comes to the capture of primary midfield target Elliot Anderson.",
      "‘Darren Fletcher has emerged as one of the big winners from a week of turmoil at Old Trafford’. Has he though?",
      "Manchester United will play the bare minimum number of games in their shortest season in 111 years. They might as well just go and appoint Roy Hodgson.",
      "Darren Fletcher was unable to part the dark clouds above Old Trafford, but the interim-interim manager has achieved some little victories, if no actual wins…"

      "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United last week; Michael Carrick is the favourite and is in detailed discussions about the interim role; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has also been spoken to by his former club",
      "By Rob Dorsett, Dan Khan, Vik Varange",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 19:37, UK",
      "Manchester United are close to agreeing terms with Michael Carrick for him to become interim manager until the end of the season.",
      "There is no final agreement as yet, and no paperwork has been signed, but the plan is for Carrick's contract to run until the end of June.",
      "Over the last few days, both Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have met with Jason Wilcox, United's director of football, who is leading the process to appoint a new boss.",
      "Carrick and Solskjaer were both candidates for the role and both former United players have met with the club's bosses and made their pitches for the job.",
      "The current short-term interim head coach, Darren Fletcher, said after the 2-1 defeat by Brighton in the FA Cup that he has now reached the end of his agreed period in charge of the first team, and he will report to the Carrington Training Centre on Monday to find out what the club want from him next.",
      "United only have the Premier League to focus on now, having been knocked out of both cup competitions, and so the focus for the interim head coach will be to qualify for European football next season.",
      "Carrick is believed to be keen for his former assistant at Middlesbrough, Jonathan Woodgate, to join him on the coaching staff at Manchester United.",
      "It's not clear as yet whether United are prepared to agree to Carrick's wishes in terms of giving a short-term contract to the former Leeds United defender, while talks continue over the make-up of the backroom staff.",
      "It is possible there is a coaching role for Darren Fletcher, who has his last game in charge of the first team against Brighton in the FA Cup.",
      "United's record goalscorer and former Derby and Plymouth Argyle boss Wayne Rooney has also expressed interest in joining Carrick's coaching staff.",
      "Speaking on the Wayne Rooney Show podcast, the former striker said when asked if he would be open to joining him: \"Of course I would. I think it's a no brainer if that's the situation but I think that the club needs is people around the place, so whether that's if Michael goes in for instance, Fletch or John O'Shea or myself or whoever it needs people around the club who know the football and Roy Keane, I think.",
      "\"Having people who know the club, who care for the club, who understand what it takes to be a Man United player I think that's where the club needs to be.\"",
      "\"They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge 10 years ago, then Ole came in charge and you go back to the old boys, then you go for a new one, then you go for more experience.",
      "\"It is almost like a cycle, like a movie we have all seen before and Groundhog Day.",

      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or less in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored a FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many. So what does the future hold?",

Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."

      "Defeat to Brighton sees United, who were given a late lifeline by Benjamin Sesko (85) before Shea Lacey was shown a red card (89) for two quick-fire bookings, knocked out both the FA Cup and the Carabao Cup at the first hurdle of the competitions for the first time since the 1981/82 season, leaving them with just the Premier League to focus on as they look to qualify for Europe.",
      "The full-time whistle was greeted with boos before near silence ensued with the Man Utd supporters and players left stunned by yet another lacklustre performance. The loss means United will play just 40 games this season - their lowest since the 2014/15 campaign when they played 44 games, and Fletcher said that the fans had every right to show their displeasure.",

      "Welbeck received a pass from Gruda and was all too easily able to take a touch and slam a 65th-minute shot into the top left-hand corner.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the message from the United fans as they urged their side to get back into the game. Benjamin Sesko headed home Fernandes' corner to bring some hope, but United's day got worse with 18-year-old Lacey receiving two quick yellows in succession, the second for dissent, as a late equaliser evaded them.",

      "Roy Keane has called for Newcastle United boss Eddie Howe to succeed Ruben Amorim at Man Utd; Gary Neville has told the club to \"remove the risks\" in the search for Amorim's successor and cited Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti as ideal example candidates",
      "Friday 9 January 2026 00:09, UK",
      "Roy Keane has called for Eddie Howe to succeed Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, as Gary Neville tells the hierarchy to \"remove the risks\" while citing Thomas Tuchel as the perfect appointment.",
      "Amorim was sacked on January 5 with both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick at the forefront of the club's plans to take over on an interim basis, before a permanent successor is named in the summer.",
      "The exit of Amorim, 14 months after he arrived at the club, marked the sixth manager to be dismissed at United since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, with Neville now calling for the hierarchy to remove any form of risk when they make the final decision on his successor.",
      "The shortlist of candidates in the running to take over permanently in the summer is yet to emerge but Keane has suggested Newcastle United boss Howe could be the perfect blend of experience and calmness to lead the club forward.",
      "\"He's managed seven or 800 games. He's still a young man. I love his calmness. Maybe Man Utd need a little bit of that.",
      "\"We've seen with our previous [appointments], we like people with emotions, but he's got that calmness. The job he's done at Newcastle, Champions League and winning a cup, I'd be happy to see him go in there.\"",
      "The club have been impressed with the current interim, Darren Fletcher, both in terms of how he has conducted himself in the media and around the Carrington training ground, and the rapport he has quickly built up with the squad, many of whom are already well known to him.",
      "However, after overseeing a 2-2 draw with Burnley in his first game as interim, Keane was quick to put any talk of a permanent role for Fletcher leading the senior team to an abrupt end.",
      "\"Do I think Fletch is the man to do it? Absolutely not,\" he added.",
      "\"But he's stepping into do it for a few weeks and a few months. He'll probably win a few games. If they go with Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], good luck to them. I wish him well.",
      "\"They need to get a top manager in to get a grip of the dressing room.\"",
      "Neville echoed Keane's calls for experience at the helm, insisting the club need to \"remove the risks\" with their next head coach by appointing someone who knows the Premier League, thrives under pressure and has a proven track record of success.",
      "\"For so long, over 12 years, the football has been really poor. If you think about the appointments over that time, Jose Mourinho is the only one who fits the criteria of the club.",
      "\"Knowing the league, remove the risks. Have they managed in the league and do they know the game here? Have they managed in Europe and done well in Champions League?",
      "\"Have they been successful and won titles? Can they handle big pressure and big atmosphere? They have to fit that criteria.",
      "\"You're looking at [Carlo] Ancelotti and [Thomas] Tuchel.",
      "\"They've been in England, won leagues, won the Champions League and managed big players. They won't get a bit scared if a pundit says something.",
      "\"My point is, if you think about that criteria, it only points towards two or three people.\"",

      "On assessment, it seems that United's bosses consider both Solskjaer and Carrick as a natural 'No 1'.",
      "The club are remaining patient about the process, with any appointment now seeming unlikely before Sunday's FA Cup tie against Brighton.",

      "\"The other names that have been mentioned - Michael Carrick, Ruud van Nistelrooy - these are really fantastic people.",

      "\"Whoever is going to get it out of those three who are being mentioned, I wish them all the best because it is a tough role.\"",

      "Glasner has six months left on his deal at Selhurst Park but shut down any talk of the position during a press conference earlier this week.",
      "\"I am Crystal Palace manager. It's wasted time for you to ask any more questions. I don't talk about any other club other than Crystal Palace,\" he said.",

      "\"I'm 100 per cent here, working as hard as I can, head down, ignoring all the stuff that you guys write, good or bad, because it's irrelevant,\" he said.",
      "\"It's about today's work and trying to prepare the team as well as we can for Leeds [on Wednesday], so that will never change from my perspective, my commitment to my work and my job.",
      "\"As long as I'm happy and able to express myself in the best way that I can to help the team, nothing will change.\"",
      "Asked if there was anything which could tempt him away from St James' Park, Howe replied: \"No, not at this current time.",
      "\"The most important thing for me is happiness in the role, happiness in the job, the relationships I have with the people around me. Now that's not always been consistently good and things can change at any football club.",

      "Monday 12 January 2026 08:53, UK",
      "They chanted for Darren Fletcher. They chanted for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They chanted for Michael Carrick. Under the lights at Turf Moor, they played four at the back and saw an academy-graduate winger come close to scoring a stunning winner.",
      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",
      "Gary Neville is determined to see the club embrace their DNA and start 'playing the United way' again. Paul Parker thinks that means bringing back Roy Keane. And that is just the former England right-backs. Viv Anderson's views on the matter are unclear.",
      "Then there are the ginger ex-midfielders. Paul Scholes believes Keane's return would be greeted rapturously, comparing it to Cristiano Ronaldo's playing return - which was obviously a huge success. Nicky Butt thinks there needs to be a role for Steve Bruce.",
      "Rio Ferdinand is pleased that Fletcher has been appointed as interim coach - revealing that the former players' WhatsApp group agrees - and is even more delighted that Sir Alex Ferguson was consulted by his compatriot before taking on this temporary role.",
      "The devotion to the cult of Ferguson might seem like harmless deference to an octogenarian legend but it hints at a longing for what is long gone that retains a material influence on what must happen next. United are still searching for that secret sauce.",
      "Perhaps it is to be expected given Ferguson's outsized importance at a club of United's vast stature. Arguably England's biggest club and certainly its best supported, they have nevertheless only won the title under two men since the First World War.",
      "For context, that is the same number as Burnley. It is fewer than the number of different managers who took Chelsea to the Premier League title over a seven-year period in the 2010s. Manchester City managed to win it under three different men in just six years.",
      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",
      "The unfortunate truth is that there is no Ferguson coaching school, no thread of an idea passed down to the next generation, just the gut feeling of a great manager. One who showed throughout his long and successful career that he could adapt to the times.",
      "What would Ferguson do now? We do not know. Most likely, it would look as different as Norman Whiteside did to Carlos Tevez, as different as his Aberdeen team to his late-era United, not some facsimile of a system adopted when John Major was in power.",
      "Fresh concepts came via an ever evolving cast of assistants. He played with strike pairings until he didn't. He played 4-4-2 until he didn't. He played open and attacking football until Champions League success demanded a different approach away from home.",
      "The myth at the heart of all this is the idea that Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex are and were United incarnate, the products of some immaculate conception at The Cliff, rather than the outsiders they were. Both Scots, Busby even played for Man City and Liverpool.",
      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",
      "Speaking of Jurgen Klopp, one recalls an awkward conversation with Borussia Dortmund chief Carsten Cramer when it was pointed out that for all his talk of the need for what he likes to call 'Dortmund guys', it was Klopp, a Swabian, who won their last title.",
      "And yet, still the idea is seductive, a comfort to these clubs scrambling to recapture something lost. How else to explain turning to a man sacked by Middlesbrough in June or a man last at Besiktas who was sacked by Manchester United themselves in 2021.",
      "This is familiar ground for both, of course, Carrick and Solskjaer each having stepped in to steady the ailing ship before. Ryan Giggs did so before them. Ruud van Nistelrooy has done so since. Fletcher now joins that list as United try again to work out what comes next.",
      "But this is stasis not progress and it cannot be presented as some great restoration plan destined to Make United Great Again. It is the absence of an idea rather than a return to one, a club so weighed down by its own history that it gives up forging a new future.",
      "By all means, play positive football with a back four and try to bring through young players. This is hardly unique and it is the aim of most clubs in the country, funnily enough. As with Busby and Ferguson, you do not need to be steeped in United's traditions to do it.",
      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

      "Wilson, Silva and Fulham are reaping the rewards now.Peter Smith",
      "\"Because of my career and the teams I've managed, I've been through a lot of these awkward games.\" And Sean Dyche tends to succeed in most of them.",
      "Four consecutive defeats in a row set Nottingham Forest up to be dragged further into the relegation scrap by West Ham. After just 13 minutes, that was their reality.",
      "But Forest kept their cool and crucially made the most of the two big moments that went their way. Dyche's side recognised the lucky escape they had when West Ham's second goal was ruled out for offside at the start of the second half and went on the attack.",
      "Nicolas Dominguez's header soon brought them level before VAR intervened again and gave Morgan Gibbs-White the chance to complete the turnaround from the penalty spot.",
      "Forest had more xG, more shots on target, more touches in the opposition box and more possession. And with Dyche they had more experience in how to grind out a crucial victory in a relegation six-pointer.",
      "\"It's not easy on anybody,\" he concluded. \"The players, overall, have just about deserved it.\"David Richardson",
      "Fans wondered who would fill the void left by Ivan Toney. Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa stepped up.",
      "When those two left, it was left to Igor Thiago to step up. Having had his early Brentford career derailed with a serious injury, all the eggs were placed into his basket. And what a decision that was.",
      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Darren Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley has meant a temporary halt to the active talks with candidates as everyone at the club focuses on that match, but I'd expect things to accelerate towards the back end of this week.",
      "Jason Wilcox, the club's director of football, was key in the decision to sack Ruben Amorim, and is leading the search for his successor - both in the short and the long term.",
      "So far, he has held only informal talks with a number of candidates, including the two primary targets for an interim role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick. Much has yet to be decided about:",
      "It is clear that United prefer the idea of appointing an interim coaching team for the remainder of this season, to allow a more thorough process of due diligence on the greater number of big names who are more likely to be available in the summer (think Oliver Glasner, Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Roberto De Zerbi). But the timing of when that interim takes charge is a vital and difficult decision.",
      "While other top clubs might consider playing a changed team in this weekend's FA Cup third round to prioritise their Premier League campaigns, the competition is really important for Manchester United - who host Brighton on Sunday.",
      "For a start, it is their only realistic chance of silverware, and a route into European football next season. But it is also the only other competition they are involved with.",
      "United's elite players are attuned to a hectic schedule of perennial weekend and mid-week matches. When the fixture calendar is much more sparse than that, it can be discombobulating.",

      "If it is Solskjaer who takes over, his first spell in charge in 2021 saw him predominantly go with a 4-2-3-1 formation, which this current United squad has - famously - rarely used.",
      "Finding successful partnerships in the new system, working out which players are best in which positions, maybe re-integrating Kobbie Mainoo into the starting XI - all those things would be easier with the extra matches a cup run would bring.",
      "So, Sunday is not a game that United can take lightly. And part of their decision about the coaching quandary will be dictated by what is best for the team at that stage.",
      "Is it best to leave Fletcher in charge at Old Trafford for the tie, or better to bring the new man (or men) in at the first opportunity? A thorough assessment of the game against Burnley will be required.",

      "After paying around £10m in severance to Amorim and his staff, United will again want to try to avoid a big compensation bill for whomever they employ next.",
      "That is at least part of their thinking about why it is best to kick the can down the road, and postpone the big appointment until the summer.",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."
