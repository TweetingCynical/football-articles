      "Radamel Falcao flopped at Manchester United  (Image: \n   GETTY\n  )",
      "Radamel Falcao rejected Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in order to sign for Manchester United. It was in 2014 when the striker became the latest big name to sign for the Red Devils, and it was a decision he made on deadline day.",
      "According to the Colombian's father, Falcao considered United the most important club in England and was prepared to turn down offers from their biggest rivals in order to call the Theatre of Dreams home.",
      "The striker first emerged on the world stage with Porto before his time with Atletico Madrid saw him become regarded as one of Europe's most potent strikers. A record of 70 goals in 91 games in Spain saw Falcao lead Diego Simeone's side to back-to-back Europa League titles in 2011 and 2012.",
      "After netting 34 goals in his second and final season in Madrid, he signed for Monaco for a reported £50million but suffered a devastating knee injury six months into his career in the principality.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! ** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "Upon his return from injury the following summer, a loan move to United was triggered, giving United the option to make the transfer permanent for a reported £43.5m. United, then led by Louis van Gaal, were said to have beaten several of their domestic rivals to Falcao's signature.",
      "Radamel Garcia, Falcao's father and a former footballer who represented Colombia and played at the 1980 Summer Olympics, listed the clubs his son rejected in order to join United. \"Manchester United is the most important team in England and one of the most powerful financially,\" he said on Colombian radio.",
      "\"Juventus, Manchester City, Liverpool also approached him and Arsenal at the last minute. Fortunately, he ended up at Manchester United, a great team that he has to lead forward.\"",
      "Radamel Falcao failed to impress at Old Trafford(Image: Corbis via Getty Images)",
      "Days before Falcao inked a deal with Old Trafford, he sparked rumours of a cross-city move to Real Madrid after posting on social media: \"Hala Madrid.\" The apparent angling of a move to the Santiago Bernabeu broke down with his father revealing why.",
      "He explained: \"Things did not happen with Real Madrid because if you have money and you go to the shops to buy a shirt or trousers, you have to decide if you buy it or not. So Real Madrid opted not to do it, and you can't do anything about that. Apart from that, I don't know, I have a feeling they wanted the player to offer himself as a gift with a number of conditions and things like that.",
      "The striker scored just four goals in 29 games for the Red Devils(Image: PA)",
      "\"It didn't happen because, as I said, they decided to buy the trousers and the shirt they wanted, and they considered what was better for them, and you have to accept that because they are the ones who pay the money. Thank God, everything happened with Manchester United.\"",
      "Despite the reputation he built in Spain and France, 'El Tigre' never quite clicked in England. In his sole season at Old Trafford, he managed just four goals in 29 games across all competitions.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "After returning to parent club Monaco, he was subsequently sent back on loan to the Premier League, this time at Chelsea. However, Falcao's fortunes in the English top flight failed to improve, as he scored just one goal in 12 games before a serious thigh injury ended his season early.",
      "A permanent transfer to Galatasaray for Falcao was clinched in 2019, and he spent two years in Turkey before returning to Spain with Rayo Vallecano. After three years back in LaLiga, Falcao returned to Colombia to play for Millonarios and continues to represent the club.",

      "He added: \"I'm still only 24. I feel like I've been through a lot of experiences. I want to keep improving. I think the obvious one would be goals and assists, which is the one everyone wants to get better at.",

      "Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund could potentially be joined by another Manchester United colleague at Napoli. The Italian heavyweights are reportedly keen on securing Jadon Sancho.",
      "The winger has endured difficulties since his big-money switch to Old Trafford and he has spent periods on loan at Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and currently Aston Villa. Sancho experienced a rift with Erik ten Hag and, following Chelsea's decision to pay a fee to avoid making his transfer permanent, was forced to train separately from United's first-team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho has frequently been linked with a switch to Serie A. Juventus tried to secure the England international in 2024, while Roma seemed close to finalising a deal for Sancho before he moved to Aston Villa.",
      "The Giallorossi eventually recruited Leon Bailey from the Midlands outfit, instead. His loan arrangement has been cancelled this month, though, to open up a door.",
      "Now, Napoli are the latest club to be attracted by Sancho's abilities, despite his current loan at Villa Park. Antonio Conte's side have included Sancho among their targets, according to Tuttomercatoweb.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Napoli may consider entering the market following a significant setback to their squad, with David Neres set to undergo surgery for a tendon problem and potentially facing two months on the side-lines.",
      "Sancho's contract with United expires at the end of the season, though the club retain the option to extend his agreement by an additional year. Napoli are unlikely to be deterred by Sancho's spell at United - considering the displays they have secured from McTominay and Hojlund.",
      "The former was crowned Serie A's outstanding player following his role in inspiring their championship triumph.",
      "Jadon Sancho has been linked with a transfer to Italian outfit Napoli.(Image: )",
      "Denmark international Hojlund has netted a respectable nine goals in 26 appearances for Napoli - including a vital double against Juventus. That tally already sits just one strike short of his entire output from last season.",
      "For the time being, Sancho remains on loan with Aston Villa, and he found the net for the first time in their colours during a 1-0 triumph over Turkish outfit Fenerbahce, in Thursday night's Europa League encounter. The 25-year-old's 25th-minute header proved the difference and Sancho took a swipe at his former managers afterwards.",
      "The United loanee is thriving under Unai Emery and he remarked: \"It's nice to have a manager who backs you and obviously believes in you. Again, every opportunity I get, I'm going to try and do 100 per cent, and hopefully I can deliver more goals.\"",
      "Speaking last month, amid rumours that Sancho's loan arrangement could be terminated prematurely, Emery also offered his support to the winger. He commented: \"Jadon's still being young.",
      "\"He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But, in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea. He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him, hopefully we can get it.\"",

      "Oliver Glasner will remain at Crystal Palace until the end of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Oliver Glasner does not regret his “emotional” outburst following Crystal Palace’s defeat to Sunderland but insisted “everything is cleared” with chairman Steve Parish.",
      "The Eagles boss said his side felt “abandoned” with “no support” following that 2-1 loss, Palace’s first match without former captain Marc Guehi, shortly before the defender finalised a move to Manchester City. Parish was forced to consider whether to sack Glasner before his contract expires in the summer and a potential move to Manchester United is on the cards.",
      "Glasner announced last week that he will not sign a new deal with Palace, putting him in the picture for the United job in the summer, when they will appoint a long-term successor to Ruben Amorim. His subsequent rant against the Eagles hierarchy could have spelled the end of his time in south London, but he has cleared the air with Parish.",
      "“No, I don’t regret (it),” said Glasner. “Do I think it was the best way? No, I don’t think so, but that’s Oliver Glasner. I think it’s also a part of what we achieved together, that I’m that emotional. I think it helps to create the spirit, that togetherness, that belief. Sometimes maybe it’s not the best possible way, but that’s me.",
      "“I don’t say I’m perfect. I would like to be. On the other side, I never attacked anyone personally. I just explained my feelings about the situation.”",
      "The Austrian last week confirmed he would be leaving last season’s FA Cup winners, who are on a 10-game winless run across all competitions, when his contract expires at the end of the season. Glasner added: “I don’t regret it because I know how I am, about who I am. I was asked, ‘Do you think, could this happen again?’ I said yes, because that’s how I am.”",
      "The 51-year-old revealed he had a “very long dinner” with co-owner Parish, one he felt was a “very, very good talk for both of us”, though added “nothing changed” about his decision to leave. Glasner also emphasised his issue was not with the idea of selling his captain in principle, but with how the situation was handled.",
      "Marc Guehi's exit to Manchester City annoyed Oliver Glasner(Image: PA)",
      "“One year ago in February I agreed to sell Marc. It’s all about timing and replacement,” Glasner revealed. “I know that Crystal Palace will always sell players if they have big offers from other clubs, but it was just the situation, telling the team 28 hours before a Premier League game that the captain is leaving. This was my feeling at that moment.”",
      "Glasner, who was adamant both he and Parish are “100 per cent committed” to a strong finish to the campaign, believes the situation around wantaway striker Jean-Philippe Mateta is “very clear”.",
      "He added: “He didn’t hand in a transfer request and we have no bid received right now. That is the situation.” But pressed as to whether or not he had informally spoken to the France international about a move away, Glasner would only say: “I speak with many players about different topics, but I think what they deserve is that I don’t tell it publicly.”",
      "Glasner likened the past week to a “thunderstorm” but predicted a brighter forecast, particularly with the returns of Ismaila Sarr, back in the squad after winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal, and a healthy Daniel Munoz. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson will captain Palace for the remainder of the season, including Sunday’s meeting with Chelsea at Selhurst Park.",

      "A filmmaker abandoned his boyhood dream of a football career due to fears about the size of his penis. Sikou Niakate, 34, grew up playing football in Paris and idolising Sir Alex Ferguson 's Manchester United sides.",
      "He aspired to emulate David Beckham and Patrice Evra at Old Trafford, showing promise and even drew comparisons to Manchester City legend Yaya Toure due to his tall frame and style of play. However, Niakate has now revealed how he let go of his dreams of joining a football club because he felt embarrassment about his private parts.",
      "In a fascinating new documentary titled 'Dans le noir, les hommes pleurent' (In the Dark, Men Cry), which addresses issues of masculinity and is available on YouTube, the director recounts two distressing incidents from his youth that fuelled his fear of ever changing in a dressing room. The prospect of communal showering quickly became unthinkable, ending his dreams of a career in football.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe, he said: “As a child, I only wanted one thing: to become a footballer. I dreamed of Manchester United, the red shirt, the number 7, David Beckham, and Patrice Evra. I gave everything for it. I played football for at least three hours a day. I was good. Excellent, even. I played midfield, sometimes as a number 10. I was tall, very tall. In middle school, I was already 1.92 m. I was technically gifted. Really technically gifted. Which is rare for a tall guy.",
      "“I had better passing accuracy than all the guys I played with; I was even the one who crossed the ball, even though I was the tallest, because I was so precise. I was a bit like Yaya Touré. I was playing in my neighbourhood, in Paris, in the 19th arrondissement. Naturally, the question of joining a club came up. But that would have meant accepting the idea of communal showers, and for me, that was unthinkable. Impossible. What I was hiding would become visible.”",
      "He had dreams of playing for Manchester United(Image: Wolves via Getty Images)",
      "He explained: “When I was little, one day, I was getting ready to shower while my sister was cleaning the bathroom. We started bickering, she got angry and said to me, laughing, 'With your tiny little d***.' When she said that, those words pierced me, they killed me. I thought I wasn't normal, that my body wasn't beautiful, and that I was going to have to hide it.",
      "“Later, after a football match, one of my friends showed me his penis, for no reason, just as a joke, and asked me to show him mine. His penis was much bigger and I didn't want to. He kept pressuring me, insisting it was weird that I said no. I had no choice. I pulled down my sweatpants and underwear. He looked, held back a laugh, then exploded: 'You have a tiny little d***, it's crazy.'",
      "“I was dying inside. I walked behind him, looking at the ground, head down. I'm a monster. So I decided never to play club football. Never, ever. So maybe when I did play, I was twice as good because I was compensating for not being able to play on a team. I'm not saying I had the talent for a huge career, but I think I could have played for a club, even a good one. But showing myself naked wasn't an option.",
      "Sikou Niakate was ridiculed for his penis size(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "He couldn't step into a communal shower(Image: Sikou Niakate)",
      "“I talk about the importance of penis size in my documentary, 'In the Dark, Men Cry'. And with all the feedback I received, I realised it affects a huge number of men. It's called 'the locker room syndrome.'",
      "“I used to think I was the only one whose mind was constantly saying, 'How embarrassing to have this body!' It never left me. In middle school, in PE, I always scored between 17 and 20, but when it came to swimming, I got a zero. I never went. It would have meant wearing a swimsuit that would cling to my crotch. Wearing a swimsuit in the shower? Forget about it!",
      "“If I played basketball in a club, it was because I could implement a strategy. I was in a hospitality school at the time. To avoid having to change in the communal locker room, I would explain that I couldn't be there earlier because of my classes and I would arrive after practice had started, still wearing my school suit. On game days, at worst, I had to take off a pair of pants, quickly put on shorts, turn around, talk, create a diversion, but the communal shower was out of the question.",
      "He claimed to play like Yaya Toure [pictured](Image: Getty Images)",
      "“I am aware that penis size has taken on an irrational importance in my life. It's my inner war. Very early on, I told myself, 'I'm finished.' As a child, I looked at my body with profound dislike but I kept telling myself, 'It'll change when I grow up.' I had this utopian vision. After a while, I realised that this body had a taste of permanence, so that utopian vision died and that's when I went very far. I told myself that I absolutely had to change. I researched surgeries and so on.",
      "“I feel like I've been punished by the genetic lottery, like I'm failing in my duty as a man and it shapes every aspect of my life. Obviously, it's excessive; I've seen with my partners how it wasn't an obstacle to pleasure, or even a topic of discussion, that they didn't perceive it the way I did. They would say, 'What are you talking about?' Probably, as a black man, I also thought that my normality had to be excess, that I couldn't just conform to the French norm. I imagine that can fuel a distorted view of oneself.",
      "“Things have gotten better since I've allowed myself to experience some shared intimacy, something that was unthinkable for a long time. But while the public self, the clothed self, is very comfortable, the naked self is much less so.”",

Recent form further highlights this gap: Arsenal are unbeaten in their last six matches, recording four wins and two draws, while United have managed two wins, three draws, and one defeat over the same period.",
      "The Gunners are enjoying an impressive unbeaten streak, now stretching to 12 matches with ten victories and two draws. Their home form has been especially formidable, as Mikel Arteta’s men have not lost at the Emirates since May 2025, when Bournemouth claimed a 2-1 win. Defensively, Arsenal have been rock-solid on home soil, ranking among the league’s best for clean sheets and conceding very few goals at the Emirates. Their matches also feature one of the lowest \"both teams to score\" percentages in the division.",
      "Manchester United, on the other hand, arrive with just one win in their last five outings. That victory, however, was a significant one: in Michael Carrick’s managerial debut, United defeated rivals Manchester City 2-0 in a commanding display. While this result offers hope of a new era at Old Trafford, Arsenal’s dominance—especially at home—presents a daunting challenge that may be too great for even an improved United side to overcome.",
      "With Carrick at the helm, United’s recent results may not fully reflect the team’s current trajectory, as the tactical setup has shifted since his arrival. In their last five matches, United have seen both teams score in four games, while only two have featured over 2.5 goals, suggesting a more disciplined defensive approach compared to earlier in the season.",
      "Overall, while Manchester United may be on the rise under new management, Arsenal’s consistency and strength at the Emirates make them firm favourites heading into this weekend’s clash.",
      "Mikel Arteta faces a potential selection headache ahead of this tricky home fixture: should he start Viktor Gyokeres or Gabriel Jesus up front? The likelihood is that Gyokeres will get the nod at the Emirates, as Jesus logged more minutes in midweek against Milan—though he did find the net twice, compared to the Swedish striker’s single goal off the bench. Until recently, Jesus had been limited to substitute appearances as he worked his way back from an ACL injury, but he’s quickly closing the gap on Gyokeres’s goal tally despite having played around 1,400 fewer minutes across the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "On the injury front, Riccardo Calafiori, Piero Hincapie, and Max Dowman were all absent from Tuesday night’s squad, casting serious doubt over their availability for the weekend.",
      "For the visitors, Michael Carrick may opt to stick with the same starting XI that secured a statement win over Manchester City last Saturday. Noussair Mazraoui is back in the fold following his Africa Cup of Nations campaign, but the match is likely to come too soon for the injured Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee. As a result, Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez are expected to continue as the central defensive pairing, unless Carrick decides to give youngsters Leny Yoro or Ayden Heaven a chance on this big stage. At left-back, Luke Shaw should retain his spot unless Patrick Dorgu—who has impressed as an attacking midfielder recently, including in the last match—returns to his former defensive role.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's situation at Manchester United has changed immensely over the past week(Image: Getty)",
      "A bright start to life under Michael Carrick has given Manchester United fresh hope for what to expect from the second half of the season. United rallied to a 2-0 derby victory over Manchester City in Carrick's debut as interim boss, where several stars stood out in particular.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was among those who impressed as he enjoyed his best display of the campaign to date. Not that he had set a particularly high bar after being largely shunned under Carrick's predecessor, Ruben Amorim.",
      "The youngster's absence from the starting XI has seen him widely linked with the exit after contract talks hit an impasse. And there's fresh news over the player's situation as his future begins to take shape.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "After not long ago looking destined for the Old Trafford exit, Mainoo's prospects have transformed altogether under Carrick's stewardship. And after just one game with the Champions League-winner in charge, the club are ready to open talks with their 20-year-old midfield gem.",
      "Mainoo's current deal is due to expire in 2027, though United have the option to extend that by a further 12 months. That being said, his salary is minuscule when compared with some of his team-mates, earning a relatively meagre £25,000 a week.",
      "Having failed to start a single league fixture under Amorim this season, Mainoo made a timely comeback at home to City last weekend. And the England international showed the fired boss exactly what he was missing in an iconic result for the Reds.",
      "Mainoo was being linked with the likes of Napoli and Chelsea as recently as this month, but any chance of an exit now seems far less likely. And it seems the more he's given a chance to shine under Carrick, Mainoo may only continue to raise questions as to why Amorim was so reluctant to play him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "On the same day that it emerged United were ready to move ahead in talks with Mainoo, Casemiro announced he'll depart at the end of this season. The Brazil veteran has confirmed he'll be leaving this summer despite the option for an extra year, and he won't be short of suitors, it seems.",
      "\"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,\" said the South American on Thursday. “From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "Casemiro's departure could also influence Mainoo's future and United's desire to keep the youngster(Image: PA)",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months. We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",
      "And that winning mentality is precisely what's attracting a list of admirers as he prepares for free agency. The Daily Mail report Major League Soccer giant LA Galaxy are one such suitor, while clubs in Saudi Arabia and home country Brazil are also understood to be registering interest.",
      "MLS could be of particular interest given franchises are exploring their opportunities to capitalise on the FIFA World Cup boom. However, teams in Brazil and the US would struggle to match the riches on offer in Saudi Arabia, with Casemiro currently United's top earner on £375,000 a week.",

      "But Manchester United and England icon husband David knows exactly what some ex-team-mates think of his wife. Rumours of a familial rift within the Beckham clan have swirled since Brooklyn's 2022 wedding ceremony, when he married actress Nicola Peltz.",
      "Birthday snubs and reported social media blocks followed before the power couple's eldest released a scathing statement online, which included accusations against both of his parents. He specifically accused mother Victoria of trying to \"ruin\" his relationship with Peltz, \"hijacking\" his first dance with her at his wedding and making him feel \"uncomfortable\" and \"humiliated\" with the \"inappropriate\" dancing.",
      "Reports suggest that Victoria is heartbroken by her son's public accusations. Husband David responded to the claims levied at him and his wife, but two of his former team-mates for the Three Lions have already provided a glimpse into Victoria's true personality.",
      "Wayne Rooney is himself a United icon, but he never played alongside David for the Manchester club. He did, however, make 39 appearances for his country with the midfielder.",

      "David played alongside Rooney for England(Image: Getty)",
      "Michael Owen also starred next to David for the Three Lions but made a handful of appearances alongside him at club level for Real Madrid. One incident that came on the back of the 1998 World Cup helps paint a picture of how Victoria acts towards her husband, who did not enjoy the best of competitions.",
      "Both Owen and Beckham were key members of the England squad that reached the last 16 that year, before a fateful encounter with Argentina. Beckham was infamously sent off in the eventual penalty loss for a kick aimed at Diego Simeone.",

      "\"I got wind that Victoria was in some way disappointed in me,\" Owen penned. \"She felt, I was told, that while all the limelight was on me after the World Cup, I should have publicly and voluntarily come out and backed David.",
      "\"I didn't consider myself senior enough to pat David Beckham - twenty times more famous than I was at the time - on the back and say, 'Keep your chin up, mate'.",
      "\"Whether I thought his actions lost us the game or not didn't matter. For me, at that time, it was about hierarchy and standing. I was just a junior member of that squad. I was really just a kid.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko looked destined for Arsenal before signing for Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "In a parallel universe, Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko could - and maybe should - be on different sides at the Emirates on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United striker Sesko was so close to joining Arsenal after a long and painstaking transfer pursuit. And maybe, just maybe, United could be getting more out of Gyokeres who has struggled to adapt since his £64m move to Arsenal.",
      "They were two of the most eye-catching deals of the summer when the Premier League went on a huge splurge on strikers. Liverpool broke the bank to sign Alexander Isak for £125m and £79m on Huge Ekitike.",
      "Arsenal finally ended their long pursuit to sign a top class centre forward and put all their money on Gyokeres as they landed the Sweden striker from Sporting Lisbon after he plundered 97 goals in 102 games for the Portuguese giants.",
      "This marked a sharp turn for Arsenal who had previously been chasing Sesko, the young Slovenian striker at RB Leipzig. But the Sesko trail went cold for Arsenal after the arrival of their new sporting director Andrea Berta in March 2025 who almost immediately set his sights on Gyokeres.",
      "There can be no doubt Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta backed Berta’s appointment and has a big say in transfers so they were definitely singing from the same hymn sheet.",
      "The reasoning on Gyokeres over Sesko was that it was all about the here and now. Sesko, still only 22, was young, raw and a work in progress. Gyokeres is 27.",
      "Arsenal wanted an oven ready striker to score goals and get them over the line and winning trophies straight away. It really was that simple.",
      "Arsenal actually came closest to signing Sesko in the summer of 2024. They had strong dialogue with RB Leipzig, Sesko’s agent had been courted and Arsenal were ready to press the button on a deal which would have cost in excess of £45m.",
      "However, it was Sesko who - despite indicating that he wanted to move to the Emirates above anywhere else - wobbled at this stage because he was wary of moving to Arsenal and then having to share striker duties with the likes of Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus.",
      "He felt he would develop more by staying one more year at RB Leipzig who also used the opportunity to renegotiate his contract and insert a far more formal buy-out clause. Arsenal still maintained regular contact through the 2024/25 season.",
      "Even when Edu left and Jason Ayto - who took up the sporting director role on an interim basis and is now at Brighton - the club made regular visits to Germany, kept in touch with the family and agent and did all the things that a club pursuing a hot target do.",
      "But that changed when Berta came in. The regular trips tailed off and it became obvious that Sesko was no longer the stand-alone candidate. He was still in the mix but Berta was championing Gyokeres.",
      "Andrea Berta pounded the table to bring Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal(Image: (Photo by Jacques Feeney/Offside/Offside via Getty Images))",
      "However, it is fair to say that when Arsenal moved on Gyokeres, both RB Leipzig and Sesko were left high and dry. The German club were banking on his exit. Suddenly it looked far from certain.",
      "Sporting were not happy with Arsenal (who, in fairness, were just trying to do what every club does by driving a hard bargain) and it soon became clear the Portuguese club were pushing Gyokeres towards Manchester United.",
      "Gyokeres had played under former United boss Ruben Amorim at Sporting but the Swede made it clear he was not interested. At that stage, maybe he was more suited to United’s playing style than Arsenal because he is more focal point than pressing machine.",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko rejected Newcastle and it has been reported that, despite the Slovenian then setting his sights on Old Trafford, Amorim was not entirely convinced and wanted a more experienced striker. Gyokeres might have been a better fit.",
      "United ended up paying £74m for potential in Sesko with Arsenal paying £64m for Gyokeres.",
      "Sesko has taken some time to adapt - but there is confidence he will come good in the long run(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The United fan base are split on Sesko. Scouts still maintain that because of his age, athleticism and pace, he will come good and be a prolific centre forward. But, tellingly, Sesko was only on the bench for Michael Carrick’s first game in charge of United and they beat Manchester City 2-0.",
      "Arsenal fans have been supportive of Gyokeres. But, despite his super strike against Inter Milan in the Champions League, he has really struggled. He does not look on the same technical level as his teammates, he has not scored enough and looks sluggish.",
      "Back in August, Sesko and Gyokeres did not even share minutes on the pitch when Arsenal beat United 1-0. Sesko was a 65th minute substitute and Gyokeres was hooked after an hour.",
      "You suspect both will have a point to prove if they do go head-to-head on Sunday when Arsenal and United will also be determined to show they ended up with the right striker.",

The Red Devils have had long-standing issues with information leaking out of the club and have launched several internal probes before.",
      "Carrick would pick up three points in his first game in interim charge, with Patrick Dorgu and Bryan Mbeumo finding the back of the net at Old Trafford. Team leaks are not a new problem for United and have been ongoing for almost 10 years.",
      "Jose Mourinho, who also suffered with the problem, publicly acknowledged it by making a quip in a press conference before the 2018 FA Cup final. Carrick has not commented on the issue, which reared its head again last weekend, but Ruben Amorim's tenure was also plagued by leaks and led to frustration.",
      "Now, The Sun claims the club has launched an investigation in an effort to find the mole after the starting XI accurately appeared online hours before last week's derby victory.",
      "Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, Casemiro, Amad and Mbeumo all returned to the starting XI, while Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha dropped to the bench. It was a move that paid off, with Carrick utilising Dorgu on the left-hand side of the attack.",
      "United dominated the game and moved close to the top four, following Liverpool's draw with Burnley at the weekend.",
      "This is not the first time the club have looked into the source of the leaks. The Red Devils reportedly launched an inquiry in December into how Amorim's intentions to change his system came out on the day of a fixture against Bournemouth.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The Mail reported at the time that United were determined to identify who was offering up inside information to stop such occurrences from repeating themselves in future. A club spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "United were also reported to have been 'furious' in September following suggestions that Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes is 'unhappy'.",
      "The club's team line-up was also revealed well ahead of the Manchester derby in December 2024.",
      "\"I know that story,\" Amorim said at the time. \"I don't know, I think it's impossible to fix nowadays because you have a lot of people in the club, the players talk with agents.",
      "\"I don't know, you can talk with friends, so it's hard to know. It's not a good thing, but let's move on and go to the next one and see if they find the next starting XI.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim saw his Manchester United formation change leaked before a game against Bournemouth(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Countless other stories surfaced last season, including those regarding squad issues and team news, with United's senior management taking steps to identify the source of the leaks within the camp.",
      "Previous managerial tenures at M16, under Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Mourinho, were similarly impacted by leaks. While it clearly presents a major problem at United, Carrick's focus will now be on preparing his side for the Premier League clash with Arsenal.",
      "Speaking about the upcoming challenge, United's interim boss said: \"I am looking forward to the game. It's a big challenge. They are a very good team. It is pretty obvious to say that, they have so many strong points to their game. It is a big challenge.",
      "\"They are where they are for a reason in the Champions League, we are fully aware of that and not taking that lightly at all. We feel we are in a good place and we go there looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It is where we want to be; we want to be positive with that energy and enthusiasm, but we know it is not going to be easy.",

      "Indeed, if you hadn't been banned by Fergie, you were not deemed to be doing your job properly.",
      "Despite his fierce public persona, there was a lighter side to Fergie. After leading United to the title in 2013 before stepping down, champagne was poured for reporters at his press conference.",
      "As ever with Fergie, there was a sting in the tail, waiting until everybody had taken a sip before delivering the killer line: \"Don't worry, I've got the police waiting at the end of the road to breathalyse you all!\"",
      "‌When the Mirror reported a spy plane flying low over United’s training ground, to get intel on their tactics, Fergie could not resist a playful dig.",
      "When I asked Fergie about the plane, he burst into laughter. “I saw you flying it,” he said, using his hands as a pair of flying goggles. “I could see you up there - Biggles McDonnell! Biggles of the Mirror!”",
      "Nothing will beat Sergio Aguero's last-gasp winner against QPR to win Man City the title(Image: PA)",
      "A succession of managers have tried and failed to emulate his remarkable success and, as Fergie's reign was coming to an end, the Blue Moon was rising on the other side of Manchester.",
      "City emerged from the shadow of their more illustrious neighbours to begin a period of their own domestic domination and emulated United's 1999 Treble triumph in 2023, under the peerless Pep Guardiola.",
      "For sheer drama, nothing beats Sergio Aguero's 94th-minute winner for City to snatch the title on goal difference from local rivals United with virtually the last kick of the 2011-12 season, with the Red Devils already celebrating another famous triumph.",
      "The best game? A tough one, given there have been so many epic encounters, but it probably has to be the breathless Manchester derby of 2009, a Michael Owen goal in added time sealing a dramatic 4-3 win for United at Old Trafford, after which Fergie infamously branded City the “noisy neighbours”.",
      "Michael Owen's winner against Man City a Old Trafford in 2009(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The best goal? Again, too many to choose from, but for sheer audacity and technical brilliance, Wayne Rooney's spectacular 35-yard volley against Newcastle in 2005, while Cristiano Ronaldo's bullet header away to Roma in 2008 – I still can't fathom how he made up so much ground to reach the ball – remains an iconic goal.",
      "So after more than 1,000 games at home and abroad, six World Cups, three European Championships and 23 pre-season tours, not to mention half a dozen bans from Fergie, the time has come to say farewell.",
      "Thanks for reading over the past two-and-a-half decades. What a ride it's been!",

      "Kobbie Mainoo could sign a new deal with Manchester United(Image: Richard Sellers/Getty Images)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo once refused to to leave his car alongside the fleet of flash motors his Manchester United team-mates owned. But he now has the chance to park himself in the United midfield for the next decade if he chooses to.",
      "In the space of a fortnight, the humble Mainoo has gone from being an outcast, to someone United are desperate to tie down to a new long-term contract. Had Ruben Amorim still been manager, Mainoo would now be packing his bags for a trip to Napoli. A move to the Amalfi Coast to rescue his career, alongside Kevin De Bruyne and former United team-mate Scott McTominay.",
      "But instead, Mainoo has been released from his Manchester malaise to find himself reborn. Thanks to the common sense of interim manager Michael Carrick, United have woken up to the fact the club has a bona fide superstar in the building. A midfielder capable of starting for England in the final of a major tournament. A footballer United have spent years bringing through the academy, to represent the first team with all the qualities the club prides itself on.",
      "Amongst all the desperation and darkness of United's fall from grace, Mainoo's emergence has been a rare flash of light. And despite his progress to the top, he has remained on a contract worth just £25,000-a-week. A deal which runs until 2027, but needs ripping up and replacing with one which reflects Mainoo's long-term value to his hometown club.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Fellow midfielder Casemiro earns the equivalent of what Mainoo does before he's brushed his teeth on a morning. Which is part of the reason United have decided to release the Brazilian at the end of this season. His £350,000-a-week deal is no longer sustainable or justified.",
      "And while United bosses are having a rare moment of coming to their senses, it has dawned on them that some of this cash should be invested in the future, not the past. Mainoo will spend the next few weeks talking to United about a new contract. And with Casemiro heading towards the exit and Bruno Fernandes considering his position, Mainoo has United over a barrel.",
      "This is a footballer who wouldn't dream of holding his hometown club to ransom. Mainoo would rather go to Nando's than nightclubs - and drinks water instead of champagne. His initial impact at United earned him a new fan club, which included England and United legend Bryan Robson, no less.",
      "Michael Carrick has changed everything for Kobbie Mainoo at Manchester United(Image: Getty)",
      "Robson was so impressed and fascinated with Mainoo, he even made trips to Carrington just to watch him train. \"He's that good,\" said Robson, \"and he's only going to get better. He's shown nothing but maturity throughout his Manchester United career.\"",
      "That's quite a compliment, coming from someone who knew a thing or two about how to boss a midfield at the highest level. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe needs to look at Mainoo and appreciate the value he has. Since Amorim's sacking, Mainoo has been reintegrated into the senior fold.",
      "Interim boss Darren Fletcher started the 20-year-old in the FA Cup third round defeat by Brighton earlier this month, and Mainoo kept his place for Carrick's first game in charge as United beat Manchester City at Old Trafford. Mainoo signed a long-term deal in 2023.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is in a strong position ahead of contract talks(Image: Getty)",
      "And had hoped to pen a new one in the wake of his scoring contribution to United's FA Cup final triumph over City in 2024. But nothing was agreed. Mainoo had reservations about his club's attitude towards him. A feeling which strengthened when Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager.",
      "But Carrick has made United come to their senses. Giving Mainoo the kind of contract he deserves will cost United. But even a club as utterly dysfunctional as United should realise that it will be a small price to pay.",

The Barcelona loanee will return to action in La Liga on Sunday when Hansi Flick's side host Real Oviedo, hoping to improve his standing as doubts supposedly emerge over his future in Catalonia.",
      "And that encounter teases the prospect of seeing Rashford go up against former team-mate Eric Bailly, who has been on the books in Asturias since last summer. The Ivorian completed a free transfer to Oviedo after his contract with Villarreal expired and is currently in a dogfight to keep the club among Spain's top tier.",
      "Oviedo currently sit bottom of La Liga, while Rashford's Barca are one point ahead of Real Madrid at the summit. And the Blaugrana will expect to enforce their will upon the relegation favourites, who who are seven points from safety.",
      "Bailly, 31, has played a fairly minimal role in their return to the top flight and made just five league appearances to far this season. However, there's a risk he may not be a part of manager Guillermo Almada's squad after missing their last two games.",

      "It had looked like his form earlier this season would be enough for Barcelona to trigger the £26million purchase option in his loan deal. The Athletic reported bosses are concerned regarding the efficacy of his defensive work, a key demand of attacking players in Flick's system.",

      "Casemiro is leaving Manchester United this summer(Image: PA)",
      "Manchester United's announcement that Casemiro will leave Old Trafford at the end of the season is a clear sign the club are planning ahead for the summer transfer window. It emerged this week that the Brazilian veteran, 33, will depart this summer when his contract expires after four seasons with the club.",
      "United decided not to extend the five-time Champions League winner's enormous £350,000-a-week deal, having signed him in August 2022 during Erik ten Hag's tenure. Casemiro has featured in 146 matches and scored 21 goals for United thus far, with Michael Carrick's eventual managerial successor set to lose an experienced voice in the dressing room.",
      "However, his exit will provide an opportunity for a much-needed midfield rebuild given the space it frees up on United’s wage bill. United bosses were reported to be targeting midfield acquisitions this summer even prior to Casemiro's announcement.",
      "At the heart of midfield, there are two contenders to take over from Casemiro in Wharton, 21, and Baleba, 22. Brighton's Baleba was a well-documented target for United last summer. The club examined the terms of a potential deal but the transfer never came to fruition.",
      "Another prime target is Crystal Palace's Wharton, who could become the latest player to look to depart the south London outfit, with the club aware of the England international's ambition to compete in the Champions League.",
      "With Wharton valued at over £60m and more than £100m needed to persuade Brighton to part with Baleba, the former seems the more shrewd option, particularly given Baleba's underwhelming campaign so far. The physically dominant Cameroonian would represent more of a direct replacement for Casemiro but Wharton's Carrick-esque presence in midfield would signal an evolution in the role for United.",
      "The matter of who would play alongside Wharton is more complex given United already have academy product Kobbie Mainoo. Yet, there is one exceptional player whose displays this season indicate the club must secure him at any cost - Nottingham Forest's Anderson.",
      "Elliot Anderson [L] and Adam Wharton [R] would be two top signings for United(Image: 2025 the FA)",
      "Forest have no intention of selling the England international, 23, and competition from Premier League rivals would certainly drive up Anderson’s price, which is being reported as around £75m-£100m. But the all-action midfielder would be worth every penny as a statement signing and one who would instantly elevate the side.",
      "Should that move collapse, however, Wolves' Gomes - priced at £35m-45m - would represent a solid alternative. The Reds have been monitoring the Wolves talent since the summer as they look to bolster their midfield.",
      "That leaves the attacking-midfield position left vacant by Fernandes’ hypothetical exit. Matheus Cunha would be the favourite out of the current crop to take on the role as chief creator, though Chelsea’s Cole Palmer has recently been named as an ambitious potential signing.",
      "Cole Palmer is reportedly homesick(Image: Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)",
      "United supporter and former Manchester City player Palmer has established himself as one of the Premier League's finest players since his Chelsea move in 2023 but reports the playmaker is 'homesick' in London and might pursue a move closer to his home - Manchester.",
      "That certainly works in United's favour, with Palmer's wages also not thought to be a problem. However, the 23-year-old could cost a Premier League record fee close to the £150m mark, making his signing unrealistic.",
      "Instead, Cunha would likely step into Fernandes’ shoes in the case of his departure, with United able to sign Gomes from Wolves as a third midfield reinforcement. That could leave United’s midfield looking like this at the start of the 2026/27 season:",
      "Starters: Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson, Matheus Cunha.",
      "Depth options: Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Joao Gomes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chido Obi scored against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Derby look capable on the counter-attack. They've been tough to play against this evening and will fancy their chances of causing an upset. The Rams came close to scoring just there.",
      "Kukonki just made a positive run down the left but the referee flagged for a free-kick.",

      "Gabriel cannot believe that shot was saved. It was a decent stop from Derby goalkeeper Dziakluk, who was almost deceived by Gabriel going for the far corner after cutting inside in the box. Fletcher is now shouting from the touchline, saying: \"JJ, stay close to their centre-back.\"",
      "Derby are a pretty physical side - they have players who are capable of winning duels.",
      "Gabriel went on a brilliant run down the left but nobody could meet his cross in the box.",
      "Gabriel just evaded his marker with an impressive turn of foot - he was practising that movement in the warm-up.",
      "By all accounts, Derby are quite a decent side, so United shouldn't have it all their own way tonight, but you'd have to fancy them to progress to the next round given the quality they have on the pitch. It's really exciting to watch Obi and Gabriel start together for the first time.",
      "We're under way at Old Trafford, so stay tuned on the live blog for updates throughout the game.",

      "Casemiro has had one of the most eventful United careers of recent times(Image: )",
      "It will be two years in May since Casemiro was told to leave the football before the football leaves him. One of the greats of the modern game had just suffered a night of humiliation in South London. He had become a meme, dumped on his backside by Michael Olise and folded in two by Daniel Munoz.",
      "Give it three more games and call it quits, Jamie Carragher told him. Head to the MLS or the Saudi Pro League, where you won't be found out. Fortunately for Manchester United, Casemiro didn't listen to the advice.",
      "He was never going to leave Manchester United before Manchester United left him. He was paid too much for that. He probably couldn't believe his luck when he was offered a four-year contract on a salary of around £350,000-a-week as a 30-year-old in 2022. It was too good to turn down and too good to walk away from when the going got tough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "But he also cared too much. He never rested on his laurels. His passion, attitude and character were exemplary, and it is those traits as much as anything that have endeared him to United's matchgoing supporters.",
      "There were times when the club's best-paid player was below Toby Collyer in the pecking order, but a five-time Champions League winner with one of the most glittering CVs in the game never resorted to phoning it in. He always resolved to keep going and to bounce back, no matter how tough things got.",
      "The fact that he will leave the club as a fixture in the first team is evidence of that. He won his place back through hard work, and on Saturday he was the outstanding player on the pitch in a Manchester derby. His celebrations were enthusiastic, leaping on Michael Carrick's back at one stage after being subbed and embracing with Lisandro Martinez after running onto the pitch as they celebrated Mason Mount's goal before it was disallowed.",
      "Casemiro endured a difficult night at Crystal Palace in May 2024(Image: Zac Goodwin/PA Wire)",
      "He is a Brazilian import who won it all at Real Madrid, but he took to United as if he were a born-and-bred Mancunian. In an era when plenty of players find it difficult in Old Trafford's harsh glare, Casemiro was at home immediately. He \"massively cares\" about the club, as one source put it.",
      "There are plenty of positives around Casemiro, on and off the pitch. But it's hard to escape the astronomical cost associated with his time at Old Trafford. Signed from Real Madrid for an initial £60million in 2022 on that enormous salary, he came in during Erik ten Hag's first summer when the Dutchman had identified he had taken over a squad lacking character and personality.",
      "Casemiro had both. After watching his potential new employers lose 2-1 to Brighton and then 4-0 at Brentford in Ten Hag's first two games, he would have been forgiven for backing out. Instead, he picked up the phone to football director John Murtough after the second of those defeats and told him he still wanted to come and that he would fix it.",
      "For a while, he did. His standards were an example to everyone else in the squad. Described as an \"unbelievable professional\", he was always first in the gym for extra prep work and was respectful to everyone working at Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "One of Casemiro's senior teammates once told of the \"aura\" he carried in the dressing room. He wasn't a chest-beating leader but when he spoke, you listened. He didn't walk into the dressing room and lay his medals on the table, but he commanded instant respect.",
      "United fans quickly took a shine to Casemiro(Image: )",
      "Players were immediately impressed by his refusal to shirk a challenge, and his desire to stick up for teammates on the pitch helped unite a group that had been falling apart the previous season. His impact was immediate. United looked like they had found something under Ten Hag, and Casemiro was immense, never more so than in the Carabao Cup final in February 2023, when he celebrated like it was his first Champions League title.",
      "It's two Wembley trips that help understand Casemiro's time at the club. As good as he was in his first year, it came apart when he was exposed by Ten Hag's attempts to inject a more attacking approach, when games turned into basketball matches and the midfield was a barely patrolled zone.",
      "It reached a nadir that night at Crystal Palace, and a few weeks later, Casemiro was absent when United won the FA Cup against Manchester City. Ten Hag had said he wasn't fully fit going into the game, but named him on the bench, and he was on the official teamsheet. However, he then dropped out before United confirmed the team on social media, citing a tight hamstring in the dressing room.",
      "United pulled off a famous victory, but when Casemiro then left the after-party early, it looked like his days at the club were over. Had he not been on so much money, they would have been. He was on the market that summer, but there were no takers.",
      "That is why, despite Casemiro's many positives, it is impossible to ignore the financial aspect. When Sir Jim Ratcliffe was holding meetings ahead of his investment in the club, he cited the signing of the Brazilian as an example of United's transfer market waste, and that was in his first season when he was the apple of Old Trafford's eye.",
      "Casemiro celebrates a derby day goal on Saturday(Image: )",
      "That transfer fee paid to Real could have hit £70 million with add-ons, while his wages varied depending on whether United were in the Champions League. But it's fair to say the cost of four years of Casemiro is somewhere between £120million to £130million. You can kind of see Ratcliffe's point.",
      "But if United had more players of Casemiro's character and personality, with his standards and professionalism, then they might well be in a better place.",
      "He will almost certainly be in the starting XI at Arsenal on Sunday as he begins a farewell tour. You can also guarantee he will get a rapturous reception from the away end. He is a player who just got it at United and that endeared him to the supporters from the off.",
      "By the time he leaves, he will have clocked up around 160 games, but his Old Trafford career has been more eventful than most. The highs were high, but the lows were despairing. He will be missed by fans and teammates alike.",
      "He won't be missed on the balance sheet, but then United haven't tried to replace him yet.",

      "Michael Carrick has spoken to Casemiro this week after he confirmed he is leaving Manchester United(Image: )",
      "Michael Carrick revealed Casemiro is \"desperate\" to finish on a high at Manchester United after the midfielder confirmed he will leave the club at the end of this season. United confirmed the Brazilian will depart when his contract expires in the summer, with the announcement made on Thursday to provide clarity on his future.",
      "That allows Casemiro time to assess his options over his next move, but Carrick insists his commitment cannot be questioned. Confirmation of his exit after four years at the club comes just days after he produced an outstanding performance in the Manchester derby.",
      "Casemiro again showed his passion for the club with some jubilant celebrations in the Old Trafford victory against City and he is likely to keep his place in the side for the trip to Arsenal this weekend. Although United have only the Premier League to focus on for the remainder of the season, Casemiro can play a part in returning them to the Champions League and Carrick has held talks with him this week about leaving on a positive note.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I think the announcement for Case was for clarity as much as anything, it was decided anyway before I arrived so it's not just a knee-jerk kind of decision,\" said the United head coach.",
      "\"The type of personality, the character that he is, I think it shows with his performance last week, where he is mentally and how much it means for him to be here and to finish this season strong. I've already had that conversation with him and he's desperate to do well and finish well. It's good to see, so I've got no doubt about him at all.\"",
      "Harry Maguire is also out of contract at the end of this season and like Casemiro delivered an excellent display in the derby last weekend, returning to the starting XI after two months out with a thigh injury. His future isn't yet sealed and Carrick confirmed talks will be taking place over the next couple of months.",
      "\"I think that's just coming into that time of the season really with contracts. January is January in the window,\" he said. \"Coming towards the end of the season in terms of contracts and decisions and that will obviously be taken and discussed in good time really, and at the right time.\"",
      "Carrick did suggest he would offer his thoughts on Maguire's future, at least, with director of football Jason Wilcox set to take the lead on talks.",
      "\"I think the important thing for me is any decision I make or my staff make or the club make, it's not short-term, it's not just to get through to the end of the season,\" he said.",
      "\"I've got responsibility for whatever happens next to be in in a good place and moving forward to make the right decisions. So, as time goes on I'm sure I'll be part of it and we'll work our way through it.\"",

      "United have also made an offer to Sheffield Wednesday for Yisa Alao. Fabrizio Romano, though, claims Chelsea have beaten them and two other top Premier League clubs to him after agreeing a deal that includes an initial £500,000-plus fee as well as significant add-ons.",

      "Mateta has asked to leave the Eagles this month and United were linked with him when Amorim was at the club. \"I do think Manchester United were interested in him, Ruben Amorim was big-time interested in him,’ Morrison told Metro via Free Bets.",
      "\"But I just don’t think United could have done it there and then because they spent a lot of money in the summer bringing in Sesko, [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha.\"",
      "Liam Rosenior says Cole Palmer seems very happy at Chelsea after numerous conversations with the player, who is a huge part of their long-term plans.",
      "Rosenior said during his press conference today:",
      "I've had numerous conversations with Cole, and he seems very happy to be here. He's a huge part in our long-term plans. My job and the club's job is to get him into a situation where he can consistently perform to the level he wants to. There was frustration in the Brentford game. We need to look after him, and that's why I didn't involve him in the last game.",
      "Tom Heaton is in line for a contract extension before the third-choice goalkeeper's current deal expires at the end of this season, according to The Telegraph.",
      "United are said to be keen on keeping the veteran shot-stopper, who turns 40 in mid-April, around because of the way he works with the club's current crop of goalkeepers.",

      "Chelsea are a surprise suitor for Harry Maguire ahead of him becoming a free agent this summer, according to the Daily Briefing",

      "The former Manchester United chief scout, Mick Brown, believes Emiliano Martinez will again be one to watch for the club this summer.",
      "Brown told Football Insider:",
      "Martinez will definitely be one to watch for Man United. Lammens has done well since coming in, I think he's looked solid and reliable, but they could do with a real top-class goalkeeper in there. Martinez certainly fits that bill. I think he's still one of the best in the world when he's at the top of his game, and he would certainly be an improvement.",
      "So if Villa are going to be willing to let him go, then they'd be silly not to consider it at least. They wanted him in the summer, and nothing has changed since then. If he's available and the price isn't too much for them to afford, I would be surprised if they didn't make a move.",

      "United made the decision a while ago that the 33-year-old’s contract wouldn’t be renewed or extended and informed Casemiro that was the situation.",
      "But with speculation over his future hitting overdrive in recent weeks, he asked the club to make their plans public in order to \"bring external clarity\" to the situation, according to a source. Casemiro was keen to avoid incorrect speculation that the club would offer a new contract or trigger an option.",
      "That has become an issue in recent days, with the player holding a clause in his contract that extends his deal by a year if he starts 35 games this season. To hit that clause, he would need to start every remaining fixture, but that won't be happening.",
      "Read the full story here.",

      "Casemiro told the club's website:",
      "I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life.",
      "From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",

      "Man United are reportedly battling it out with Chelsea and Tottenham for Borussia Dortmund midfielder Felix Nmecha.",
      "Sky Germany have claimed that the Premier League trio are expressing an interest. Nmecha's contract expires in 2018, but the Bundesliga side want to extend his stay sooner rather than later.",
      "Former Man United defender Paul Parker has told the club that getting rid of Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw has to be a priority in the years.",
      "“I think Maguire and Shaw are a symbol of what has gone wrong at Man United, and I can’t get my head around people thinking they are the solution. Both of them should have been offloaded a long time ago, but they are still here collecting their paycheques,” Parker said in an interview with MyBettingSites.",
      "“The fact that they are still here is a joke. Are they the worst players in the team? No, but they have been here for so long, taking up space in the squad and performing below what you expect from a Manchester United player.",
      "“Has it been impossible to get rid of them? It is definitely a possibility that they just like being part of Manchester United and earning a lot of money, but that tells me a lot about their ambitions.",
      "“If they had real ambition, they would move on to a club where they could make a difference. They can play at Manchester United, but they can’t make a difference.”",
      "Man United have reportedly registered an interest in West Ham's Mateus Fernandes, according to SportsBoom.",
      "The report claims that Fernandes has a relegation release clause in his contract, which was inserted when he arrived from Southampton. Manchester City are also keen after his impressive individual season.",
      "Reports in Spain have claimed that Man United have launched a bid for Real Madrid star Federico Valverde.",
      "E-Noticies claim a club-record £104m bid has been put on the table and Valverde would be keen on the move. However, it's clear the move would only be feasible in the summer.",
      "Manchester United are interested in signing Micky van de Ven from Tottenham, according to TransferFeed. The Reds have tracked the Dutchman since his time at Wolfsburg.",
      "Liverpool are also interested, while Bayern Munich and Real Madrid are among the others keen on signing the centre-back.",
      "But in response to the interest, it's said that Tottenham have placed a stunning £100million price tag on Van de Ven's head.",
      "Reports this week from ESPN, suggest United are set to open talks with Fernandes over a new deal before the World Cup. In October, the captain seemed determined to stay at Old Trafford for as long as possible. Two months later, that position was thrown into doubt when in an interview back in Portugal, he suggested he did not feel wanted and outlined a number of opportunities he would like to pursue before retiring.",
      "Amorim said Fernandes had informed the club about the interview and things were smoothed over. However, last summer when the captain was weighing up a move to the Saudi Pro League, Fernandes explained it was Amorim who convinced him to stay. With the Portuguese head coach no longer at the club, it will be interesting to see how these talks transpire.",
      "According to TEAMTalk, Manchester United are expected to intensify their interest in Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson IF they miss out on Adam Wharton to Liverpool or Tottenham.",
      "United are expected to rival Manchester City for Anderson, who has been excellent since joining Forest from Newcastle in 2024. He is even set to be England's starting No.6 for the World Cup in the summer.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday spoke highly of United in the summer after they agreed to waive a fee to allow Harry Amass to join the Championship club on loan. This was due to the Owls' poor financial position under previous owner Dejphon Chansiri.",
      "Wednesday had hoped they could extend Amass' stay until the end of the campaign and their manager Henrik Pedersen was confident a deal could be done before last week's fixtures.",
      "However, the full-back is set to join Norwich City on loan for the remainder of the campaign which will be a blow for Wednesday. For United, the move to the Canaries makes more sense, particularly as Norwich will be involved in more competitive fixtures than the Owls between now and the end of the campaign.",
      "Still, it is unlikely this will go down well with them.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Aston Villa have expressed interest in Ruben Loftus-Cheek just days after he was reportedly 'offered' to United. The ex-Chelsea academy graduate has slipped down the hierarchy at AC Milan and could be loaned out as he aims to secure a place in the World Cup squad.",
      "Villa are seeking reinforcements following an injury to Boubacar Kamara, who is expected to miss the remainder of the season. According to The Athletic, Unai Emery's team could look to secure a midfielder on loan, with Loftus-Cheek among the candidates being considered.",
      "The Midlands club have already been unsuccessful in their pursuit of Conor Gallagher this month, with Tottenham presenting a permanent offer to Atletico Madrid. Loftus-Cheek was previously reported to have been proposed to United, and 'exploratory' discussions are said to have occurred."

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick has spoken to the media ahead of Sunday's trip to Arsenal in the Premier League.",
      "Carrick confirmed Matthijs de Ligt will be out of the game in north London as he continues to recover from injury. The Dutchman is understood to have recovered slower than anticipated from the back complaint picked up last year.",
      "Casemiro has provided reassurances to Carrick that he is fully committed to United and will have full focus on them despite leaving Old Trafford at the end of the season. The decision for him to leave was made before Carrick arrived at the club.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was praised for his performance and against Manchester City, with Carrick enjoying the freedom he played with. Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko has been encouraged to keep working hard as his time will come in future matches.",
      "Take a look at everything Carrick had to say in his press conference below...",
      "If Kobbie Mainoo felt his Manchester United career was stuck in the slow lane under the tutelage of Ruben Amorim, a coach who didn't seem to get what the academy graduate can offer, then it hasn't taken him long to get back on track under Michael Carrick. Mainoo has gone from considering a loan move away from Old Trafford to being back in the first-team picture since Carrick took over via Darren Fletcher, and he has spent the last few weeks back under the guidance of coaches who appreciate his talent.",
      "Carrick first got to know Mainoo when the Stockport-born midfielder was a 13-year-old whippersnapper turning heads in the academy with his close control and dribbling ability, and he is now relishing him giving him his head at first-team level.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Carrick revealed Casemiro is \"desperate\" to finish on a high at Manchester United after the midfielder confirmed he will leave the club at the end of this season. United confirmed the Brazilian will depart when his contract expires in the summer, with the announcement made on Thursday to provide clarity on his future. That allows Casemiro time to assess his options over his next move, but Carrick insists his commitment cannot be questioned. Confirmation of his exit after four years at the club comes just days after he produced an outstanding performance in the Manchester derby.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt could return to training at Manchester United in the next couple of weeks after overcoming a setback on his return from a back injury. The Dutch centre-back hasn't featured since the end of November, and his return has been halted after a setback during his rehabilitation a few weeks ago. De Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee are now the only players absent at United after a string of first-teamers returned to action in recent weeks. Zirkzee is set to miss a couple of weeks and Michael Carrick has confirmed De Ligt is still on the treatment table as well.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "That is all from the press conference. Those quotes have been tidied up and the second part of the press conference will be available later today.",
      "It is not losing momentum. It was a team last week to go into the game in a certain way. He is in a good place and trained really well. We are working with him and we are keep trying to improve him as much as possible but I have been really impressed with the way he has played and his finishing. I don't see it as anything else other than pushing on and using what he has done over the past month or so as a stepping stone to be here and be successful for a very long time.",
      "I thought he played ever so well last week. There was the incident with the yellow card so to go one-on-one with the winger for the rest of the game and to manage that and defend as well as he did was very impressive so I was delighted with him last week. It has been ups and downs with performance, not individually but collectively so it is not easy to get you rhythm and to find your top form. Diogo is really focused, desperate to do well, loves playing for the club, you can see that and, as I said he did fantastically well last week so a lot for him to build on.",
      "It is a variety in terms of strengths. I gave him a free role in many ways with the partnership with Bruno to drift and fill different spaces. Ben is very good playing on the last line and the runs in behind and we have seen that in recent weeks he has done really well to get his goals so he is in a good place. Josh can do a bit of both. He plays in drifts, plays in the hole and he leads and he is very good at bringing other people into play. It is just different styles. Certain games will suit different styles. It is great to have that flexibility. Matheus came on through the middle and made a huge difference for us in terms of carrying the game into the later stages and creating the second goal. We have got good options through there and we just thought last week that was the way to go and thankfully it paid off.",
      "We have got our ideas on what needs to be done and how we need to get there. Credit to Arsenal, they are in a really strong place for building a squad and recruitment. Mikel takes credit for that, he has done a fantastic job. We have our own ideas on what we need to do and what it is going to take get there and that is what we are working towards.",
      "I really enjoyed working with Kobbie. I have known him since he was young. I started working with him when he was 13, 14 years old when I was going through my badges. This club needs young players coming through and laying the foundation for understanding what it means, not only for the players or the squad, but for the club and the supporters. It is something we need to grasp and build on and Kobbie is a prime example. To come through so quickly and have that rapid rise, he had to play in some awfully big games and had to impact those it shows an awful lot of quality in terms of his character and being able to handle it. Part of a career is having a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories but we saw last week what he can bring. It was great. He is quite straight faced, he doesn't give you an awful lot but you can see in the way he played and expressed himself, he was enjoying himself and to see him like that was great.",
      "I am looking forward to the game. It's a big challenge. They are a very good team. It is pretty obvious to say that, they have so many strong points to their game. It is a big challenge. They are where they are for a reason in the Champions League, we are fully aware of that and not taking that lightly at all. We feel we are in a good place and we go there looking forward to the game. It is where we want to be, we want to be positive with that energy and enthusiasm but we know it is not going to be easy.",
      "Hopefully [back soon] he had a setback before I arrived, only small. Maybe not so much a setback, but I think it was a little bit slower than we hoped. He is certainly getting closer. Hopefully in the next couple of weeks or so, without putting an exact timeframe on it, he will be back and around it and it will be great to have him back.",
      "For the week or so I have not looked too far down the track. The initial thoughts have been on what is happening now. Any decision I make, or my staff make or the club make is not short term, it is not just to get through to the end of the season. I have a responsibility, whatever happens next, for it to be in a good place and moving forward, make the right decisions. As time goes on, I am sure I will be part of it and we will work our way through it.",
      "It is coming into that time of the season with contracts. January is January with the window. We are working away through that and coming towards the end of the season in terms of contracts and decisions. There will be conversations and discussions in good time and at the right time. The announcement for Case was for clarity. It was decided before I arrived, it is not just a knee-jerk decision. The type of personality and character he is shows with his performance last week, where he is mentally and how much it means for him to be here and to finish the season strong. I have already had that conversation with him, he is desperate to do well and finish well. So I have got no doubts about him at all.",
      "I will not tell you the team. No everyone came through the game really well actually. It has been a good week. A big result, a big performance and a big uplift with the feeling inside the stadium. It is finding a balance between getting the encouragement and confidence from the game and performance and keeping level headed and keeping our feet on the ground. We have got another big game coming up. One game does not make you a great team. It gives us a great foundation to build on. There's a lot of confidence, a lot of good feeling in the group but measured with that is we know what is coming and we have got to be ready for it.",
      "Carrick is here and the press conference shortly...",
      "We are just ten minutes away from Carrick ahead of the trip to Arsenal this weekend!",
      "Amorim insisted on doing everything his way at Manchester United, which meant he ignored some easy wins, like making the effort to attend an academy game to show support for the club's young players. Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure. Michael Carrick was appointed as interim last week and attended an Under-21 match just seven days later, sitting alongside Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion. Jason Wilcox, director of football, and head of the academy, Stephen Torpey, were present, while Darren Fletcher also attended after returning to his role as Under-18 following a brief stint as caretaker.",
      "It might not seem important that Carrick and his backroom staff made the effort to attend, but the truth is their presence is a symbol of support for the youth system and highlights that there is a pathway. Carrick planned to speak to the Under-21s after their game against Sporting Lisbon, another classy touch from United's interim head coach. Some academy players were disillusioned with Amorim's comments in the media, but Carrick has sought to provide encouragement in his first week in the job.",

      "Here are the topics we expect Carrick to be asked about this afternoon at Carrington",
      "We are just one hour away from Carrick's press conference. There should be plenty on the agenda for United's interim head coach to discuss today ahead of the trip to the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Last weekend's victory over City was a big statement of intent for the Reds as they remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four spot this season to guarantee Champions League football. Fifth could also be enough for United again this season but the club won't want to rely on that.",
      "Race for the top-four",

Carrick may have been preparing himself for questions on Casemiro's future this afternoon but after United's statement on Thursday evening, the response should be easier for him. The midfielder will leave the club at the end of this season and United will be needing to replace him in the summer transfer window. Speaking of transfer windows, Carrick could also be asked about potential midfield incomings this month now we know Casemiro will leave the club. United's stance has been to leave spending for the summer but it remains to be seen if this stance will change following the midfielder's confirmed departure.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo impressed on his first start of the Premier League season(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "If Kobbie Mainoo felt his Manchester United career was stuck in the slow lane under the tutelage of Ruben Amorim, a coach who didn't seem to get what the academy graduate can offer, then it hasn't taken him long to get back on track under Michael Carrick.",
      "Mainoo has gone from considering a loan move away from Old Trafford to being back in the first-team picture since Carrick took over via Darren Fletcher, and he has spent the last few weeks back under the guidance of coaches who appreciate his talent.",
      "Carrick first got to know Mainoo when the Stockport-born midfielder was a 13-year-old whippersnapper turning heads in the academy with his close control and dribbling ability, and he is now relishing him giving him his head at first-team level.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo hadn't started a Premier League game this season until last weekend's Manchester derby, but Carrick immediately restored him to the side and said he could sense the enjoyment the 20-year-old was getting out of his game.",
      "\"I think part of a career is a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories,\" he said. \"But I think we've seen last week what Kobbie can bring. It was great.",
      "\"He's quite straight-faced and he doesn't give you an awful lot, but you could see the way he played and he expressed himself. He was enjoying himself and to see him like that was great.\"",
      "Mainoo looked a star in the making when he broke through at United as a 17-year-old and he quickly forced his way into the England set-up, starting a European Championship final at 19 years and 86 days.",
      "He lost his way under Amorim and could have joined Napoli on loan this month had the Portuguese head coach not been sacked, but Carrick believes player's like Mainoo should be part of the fabric at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I've said it before, this club needs young players coming through and being the foundation for understanding what it means,\" he said. \"Not just for the players or the squad, but for the club and for the supporters. I think it's something that we need to grasp and we need to keep building on.",
      "\"Kobbie's a prime example, to come through so quickly and have the rapid rise, and to play in some unbelievably big games and impact those big games at such a young age shows an awful lot of quality in terms of character and to be able to handle it.\"",
      "If Mainoo is the flavour of the month again at Old Trafford, then Diogo Dalot continues to receive criticism as he endures a difficult season. The 26-year-old is now back at right-back having played wing-back on both flanks under Amorim and Carrick insists the under-pressure defender still has plenty to offer.",
      "\"There's been a few ups and downs with performance, not individually but collectively,\" he said. \"It's not easy to get your rhythm and find your top form individually but I think Diogo, from what I've seen here, I've known him for a while and seen him this week.",
      "\"He's really focused, he's desperate to do well, loves playing for the club. You can see that and as I said he played fantastically well last week so there's a lot for him to build on.\"",

      "The Ewinger struggled after making his mega-money move to Old Trafford and has spent time on loan at Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea and now Aston Villa. Sancho endured a falling out with Erik ten Hag and, after Chelsea paid a fee to ensure his transfer there was not made permanent, was made to train away from United's first-team under Ruben Amorim.",

      "Napoli are unlikely to be put off by Sancho's time at United, given the performances they have garnered from McTominay and Hojlund. The former was named Serie A's best player after helping inspire their league title win.",

      "Aston Villa's Jadon Sancho celebrates scoring against Fenerbahce.(Image: )",
      "For now, Sancho remains on loan at Villa, and scored his first goal for the club in a 1-0 victory against Turkish side Fenerbahce in Thursday's Europa League clash. The 25-year-old's 25th-minute header proved decisive and Sancho made a dig at his previous bosses after the fact.",
      "The United loanee is enjoying life under Unai Emery and he said: \"It's nice to have a manager who backs you and obviously believes in you. Again, every opportunity I get, I'm going to try and do 100 per cent, and hopefully I can deliver more goals.\"",
      "Speaking last month, amid speculation that Sancho's loan could be ended early, Emery also gave the attacker his backing. He said: \"Jadon is still being young.",
      "\"He has had an amazing career and is now in a moment where he needs help to recover his best performance. I have this challenge with him. He has this challenge with me as well. Of course, he is not playing all the minutes I think he has to.",
      "\"But, in the second part of the season, I believe in him. He is really being demanding himself to try to get his best moment this season with us. Of course, on Sunday we are finishing December and then starting January soon. The first match back he will play is against Chelsea.",
      "\"He has that challenge with me and himself, and with the club as well. I believe in him, hopefully we can get it.\"",

      "Oliver Glasner launched a stunning attack on his Crystal Palace bosses as he prepares to leave Selhurst Park(Image: )",
      "Having just got rid of one combustible head coach who rarely sticks to the script in public, Manchester United won't be rushing to appoint another. That's why Oliver Glasner's remarkable rant against his Crystal Palace bosses after defeat at Sunderland on Saturday was such a risk.",
      "Glasner's candidancy for the Old Trafford hotseat has dimmed a little in recent weeks, a downturn in results at Selhurst Park not helping him at a time when he needs his stock to be climbing. So getting the flamethrower out at the Stadium of Light on Saturday was an interesting strategy.",
      "Palace had just made it 10 games without a win when Glasner took studious aim at those above him for doing a deal with Manchester City for captain Marc Guehi on the eve of the game. Glasner had confirmed on Friday that he was leaving Selhurst Park at the end of the season, and much like Ruben Amorim did in his final weekend at Old Trafford, the Austrian decided one public meltdown wasn't quite enough.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"The players gave everything they could. We made no substitutions - look at the bench, there are just kids there,\" he said. \"We feel like we're being abandoned completely. Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with [Eberechi] Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding.",
      "\"I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once. Now it happens twice in six or seven months. That's just where we are now.\"",
      "This is a remarkable attack on the club employing him and the comparisons with Amorim's stunning broadside at United executives at Leeds earlier this month are obvious. Amorim's position became untenable after his remarks, but Palace seem determined to limp on with the manager who only eight months ago won them their first major trophy.",
      "Ruben Amorim could be a loose cannon in press conferences at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "In truth, this has probably been coming all season. Glasner threatened to quit at the end of the summer transfer window if Guehi was sold to Liverpool. He won the battle that day, but he was never going to win the war. Palace's business model doesn't allow players of Guehi's quality to leave for free, so City's £20million offer was £20million they couldn't afford to turn down.",
      "None of this should really come as a surprise. Palace chairman Steve Parish has made the business plan clear often enough. Glasner referenced Eberechi Eze as well, but that was another transfer that looked a certainty all summer and is just what clubs like Palace have to do.",
      "It is depressing for Glasner, depressing for Palace, and depressing for most football fans that any club with the cheek to lay down a challenge to the elite soon finds the vultures circling overhead.",
      "This is what happens when a hungry and ambitious manager ends up taking charge at one of the Premier League's upwardly mobile, middle-class clubs. Andoni Iraola probably deserves more credit than he is getting for biting his tongue at Bournemouth when his players are sold from under him as well.",
      "Glasner and Iraola are two of the standout candidates for the Old Trafford vacancy, but are now balancing disappointing runs of form at the worst possible time, and both have lost their best player during January. You can understand the frustration.",
      "Bournemouth and Crystal Palace have sold Antoine Semenyo and Marc Guehi in January(Image: )",
      "Granted, Glasner does have history here. He left Eintracht Frankfurt after disagreements with sporting director Markus Krosche over the strength of the squad, and at Wolfsburg, he clashed with Jorg Schmadtke over what he felt were broken promises to improve the squad.",
      "The common theme here is a manager pushing for more at clubs whose natural habitat is the middle ground. Is that enough to cast the 51-year-old as a loose cannon, or does a CV including a Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt and an FA Cup with Crystal Palace suggest he has earned a crack at the highest level?",
      "His ambitions would be easier to meet at an elite club, while he's hardly alone in being a manager or a head coach who sometimes disagrees with those above him. The challenge for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at United would be to manage that kind of personality rather than fall into the trap of a compliant yes-man.",
      "That's not to say Glasner is the outstanding candidate here. His CV does make him deserving of a crack at a bigger job, but there are concerns. Top of the list is that his best results have come with a back three, a system United will want to steer clear of. Recent results at Palace have also cost the club and Glasner momentum.",
      "Those are reasons for Berrada and Wilcox to think twice about approaching a manager who is on the market this summer and has Premier League experience. Worrying about what a boss with ambitions beyond the likes of Crystal Palace and Eintracht Frankfurt might say in public is not.",

      "Manchester United travel to Arsenal on Sunday looking to continue their good performance vs Manchester City(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick may as well have been lauded as a tactical genius after Manchester United produced a performance which shocked the Premier League to beat Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. On another day, had it not been for marginal offsides and some incredible reflex stops by Gianluigi Donnarumma, it could have been more.",
      "But United fans are not greedy, particularly after a performance that inspiring, and the hope is there that they can continue this form as they push for a spot in the top four. The game plan Carrick implemented against City was not expected considering how he liked his Middlesbrough team to dominate the ball in the Championship.",
      "However, he was pragmatic and had confidence his defence could keep out City's threats and hit them on the counter attack. This tactic worked to perfection. Senne Lammens made one ill-advised save for a shot that was going well off target but otherwise, had nothing to do.",
      "Meanwhile, at the other end, the Reds had ten shots, seven of which were on target. It was a case of quality over quantity and all of this came from just 32 per cent possession. The beauty of Carrick's game plan was how positive it was without the need to dominate the ball.",
      "United were patient, picked their moments and deserved the victory. While this game plan will need changing for matches against teams who the Reds, on paper, should be dominant over, they can copy and paste it for the clash with Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At Nottingham Forest this weekend, Arsenal had 60 per cent possession and tried their best to break down their opponents only to settle for a point. United sitting deep and then playing with pace on the break is arguably their best chance of stopping the runaway leaders.",
      "Mikel Arteta will be mindful of this but it is one thing knowing what is about to come, and another thing stopping it. However, what United need to be wary of, which they did not have to concern themselves with against City, is the Gunners' threat from set pieces.",
      "All the way back on the opening day of the season, United managed to hold their own against the north London club only to be caught out by a corner. There were suspicions of a foul which were waved away but Altay Bayindir was not strong enough and the goal was a poor one to concede.",
      "Last season, United were atrocious when it came to defending set pieces but they have managed to make some progress in the 2025/26 season. Lammens seems more commanding in the area and as a result, goals being conceded in this manner have dropped.",
      "But Arsenal are the specialists and you would expect this week, Carrick will be drilling in the importance of being alert at all times and how each set piece routine is a huge threat. The Gunners have the best squad in the Premier League and they are also a more physical side to most.",
      "Gabriel and William Saliba are wrecking balls at corners and United need to stand up and be counted. That is why you would expect Harry Maguire to start thanks to his aerial abilities.",
      "United have been accused of having a soft underbelly in the past but if they can replicate what they did against City at the Emirates Stadium, they will banish those criticisms.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee was pictured in the tunnel before the Manchester derby(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee has suffered a small injury. Zirkzee was absent from the squad to face Manchester City on Saturday afternoon due to the knock he picked up against Brighton.",
      "The Dutchman watched from the directors' box at Old Trafford as his team-mates secured a dominant 2-0 victory, which handed Michael Carrick a dream start to his interim role.",
      "United limited City to one shot on target and had three goals disallowed due to offside to seal the most impressive Manchester derby victory since the stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "When Patrick Dorgu scored with 14 minutes remaining, Zirkzee was pictured celebrating in the directors' box alongside Matthijs de Ligt, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson and Shea Lacey.",
      "United sources have confirmed Zirkzee's absence was due to a knock he suffered against Brighton. The 24-year-old was captured telling a fan outside Old Trafford that he would be sidelined for \"two weeks\", and it remains to be seen whether the issue affects his future in the final two weeks of the January window.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Zirkzee was unhappy with his game time during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but Amorim viewed him as an important squad member.",
      "Zirkzee has considered leaving United for the sake of minutes in January, and Italian club Roma have expressed an interest in signing him on loan for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "When asked about Roma's interest in Zirkzee, he responded: \"Man Utd said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago and they have not changed their minds.”",
      "The winter window closes on February 2, meaning Zirkzee should recover from his knock in time to leave United before the deadline, provided he is given the green light to depart, which is not guaranteed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad and Zirkzee are the only senior forwards at United. Sesko was sidelined in November with a knee injury, while Cunha has missed three games this season.",
      "Zirkzee has made 16 appearances for United in all competitions this term.",

      "Casemiro and Diogo Dalot cel;ebrate Bryan Mbeumo's goal against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",
      "The Brazilian and Argentine arrived in the same summer and both fitted the bill for \"character\" and \"personality\". Nearly four years later, they keep delivering on that front.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is making a similar impact to Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "The debate over Manchester United's best signing since the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era is a short one. Bruno Fernandes stands head and shoulders above the rest in just about every category imaginable.",
      "The Portuguese is a big game player who has delivered time and again when it matters most. For quality, for impact, for longevity, he ticks every box. At the end of next week, he will celebrate six years at Old Trafford and he is still the best player at the club.",
      "United paid an initial £47million to sign Fernandes from Sporting and even if that fee rises to the potential £67million if every add-on is met, it will still be exceptional value. The 31-year-old could yet be approaching the endgame at Old Trafford, but if he does depart, it will leave a significant hole in the team.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes stands out for his quality, but also for his rarity. United's recruitment had been haphazard over the last 13 years and there haven't been anywhere near enough success stories to match Fernandes.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a good free transfer, but his impact was short-term. Luke Shaw looks a good deal because of the length of time he has survived at the club. Ander Herrera was a solid acquisition, so too Casemiro, although his fee was big for a 30-year-old. Lisandro Martinez might be up there but for the bad luck he has suffered with injuries.",
      "It is early days, but United's summer spending spree looks like a better investment. Senne Lammens has been good, Matheus Cunha has flickered and Benjamin Sesko has shown promise for a young striker. But Bryan Mbeumo sticks out above them all.",
      "The 26-year-old produced another exceptional attacking display in Saturday's derby victory, taking his goal superbly and running himself into the ground in a centre-forward role that demanded he pull City's defenders out of position. Mbeumo forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into an excellent save and looked to be relishing the big occasion.",
      "He has made a habit of that since his initial £65million move from Brentford in the summer. The question for players when they make a step up of that size is how they will cope in the harsher spotlight. Mbeumo had Premier League experience, but a CV consisting of Troyes and Brentford couldn't prepare him for this.",
      "That he has hit the ground running is a positive sign. It is exactly what Fernandes did in the second half of the 2019/20 season, when he immediately looked like he belonged and took responsibility in a United shirt.",
      "Mbeumo's return of eight goals and an assist in 18 appearances for United is good, but just as encouraging is who he has made an impact against. There have now been goals against Liverpool, Tottenham and City. He is proving key in the biggest games and after his performance at the weekend, he will fancy a crack at Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "He has a long way to go to match the contribution Fernandes has made at United, but this has been an excellent start. For too long, United managers have had to rely solely on Fernandes as the big-game hunter. He has always been the player you turn to when the team needs a spark.",
      "Now, Mbeumo is showing evidence that he can be there as well. It was no surprise that the two of them teamed up to create the first goal against Pep Guardiola's side at the weekend.",
      "Recruitment has long been a major issue at United, but Mbeumo is shaping up to be a success story.",

      "Incredibly, after one of the most impressive Manchester United performances in some time, the main sub-plot coming out of the Manchester derby is a rift between Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Lisandro Martinez. In the build-up to the derby, the former United midfielders gave a scathing critique of the Argentine on their podcast - The Good, The Bad and The Football.",
      "\"Martinez against [Erling] Haaland,\" Scholes said before wincing. Butt responded: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?” The legendary midfielder added: “He’d score, then throw him in the net.”",
      "It was an outburst which raised eyebrows among the United fanbase as their comments went beyond normal punditry criticism, towards, at best, immature teasing of a professional footballer. Fittingly, Martinez started and impressed at Old Trafford on Saturday as he helped keep the Norwegian quiet, including producing a timely block to stop the striker.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With a 2-0 victory under their belt, it seemed the matter had been put to rest until the Argentine spoke in the mixed zone afterwards. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, Scholes was quick to respond. \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar please Lisandro Martinez.\" For now, that is where the back and forth ends but the whole saga has threatened to overshadow what was a brilliant victory in Michael Carrick's return fixture.",
      "Martinez had every right to respond to Scholes after the victory over City and that result obviously empowered him to speak out. Scholes is also no stranger to ruffling a few feathers with his takes.",
      "Back in December, he branded Ruben Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo as 'b*******' while Butt and Scholes agreed they would advise him to leave United if he to asked their opinion. Pundits should never be mere mouthpieces for the clubs they used to play for.",
      "But some pundits and ex United players are not holding back. Gary Neville was cited by Amorim over claims his criticism was influencing the club's decision makers while Roy Keane was scathing about the appointment of Jonny Evans to the backroom staff and took a pot-shot at Carrick's wife on the Stick to Football podcast after a social media spat during the midfielder's playing days.",
      "In an age where outrage sells, especially on social media, it is unsurprising to see punditry comments become a bit clos to the bone. Martinez and other United players should also be encouraged to respond to it, if they see fit.",
      "But, Martinez and his teammates are only in their right to respond if they are happy to hold their hands up when things are not going as well. It is telling when United win a match, social media is awash with posts from the squad celebrating and thanking the fans.",
      "Yet, when they lose, apologies are few and far between. Perhaps this is partly down to PRs advising their clients to keep quiet but it does come across as disingenuous to seemingly only comment after a win.",
      "Now that both men have had their say, it is time for a line to be drawn underneath this saga and for Martinez to continue doing his talking on the pitch. If he continues to perform well, the critics will have little reason to speak out.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",

      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",

      "We could (quite fairly) be accused of erring on the side of negativity here at Football365. We revel in the rubbish and are often guilty of failing to bask in the brilliance we see on a regular basis in the Premier League.",
      "We’ve selected the most overrated players, the very worst player at each club and enjoy calling out big-money signings for an entirely reasonable struggle to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "But sometimes it’s nice to be nice, and so here are the revelations of the season, the players who have surprised us with their excellence – one per club.",
      "",
      "He must have been cursing his misfortune upon his arrival last season when Myles Lewis-Skelly enjoyed one of the most stratospheric rises to prominence in recent memory, to such a degree that Calafiori was linked with an exit in the summer, 12 months on from his arrival for £42m.",
      "But he’s made the left-back position in his own in the Premier League this term, combining near faultless defensive displays with no small amount of attacking threat. Being a big lad certainly hasn’t hurt him in his successful usurping of the academy star.",
      "",
      "An honourable mention for the Lazarus of the West Midlands, Matty Cash, who we thought was finished but has played nearly every minute under Unai Emery this term, scoring in the victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. But the new level Rogers has found this season gives him the edge; his knuckleball deserves its own section.",
      "Jude Bellingham or Rogers for England? Could genuinely be a toss-up.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ graded by football analysis experts Gradient Sports",
      "Seven Premier League goals in 646 minutes for the teenager, who’s got the best minutes per goal rate (92.3) of any player in the top flight this season, with Erling Haaland (95) second. The ‘New Kylian Mbappe’ tag doesn’t seem quite so silly now.",
      "",
      "Sixteen goals is at least 14 more goals than we expected from the £30m summer signing who scored 18 in what must actually be The Best League In The World for Club Brugge in 2023/24.",
      "",
      "His ability to thread passes through opposition teams is arguably unmatched in the Premier League and he also loves a battle with a centre-forward, as Haaland found out earlier this month. Quite weird that there’s not more interest in his service from the Big Six vultures. Surely only a matter of time.",
      "",
      "Eight goals in the Championship last season, Anthony’s already got five in the Premier League, including home and away against Manchester United and at the Etihad vs Manchester City.",
      "",
      "Him being fit is a revelation in itself but the way in which he’s developed as a central midfielder has also been remarkable. That move from right-back – which we questioned like many others – may end up being Enzo Maresca’s most crucial and enduring Chelsea legacy. His performance against Arsenal in that role was extraordinary.",
      "",
      "His level has dropped along with the rest of his teammates of late, but the 29-year-old put in several hugely impressive all-round displays when it was still worth getting up in the morning at Crystal Palace.",
      "",
      "Few would have predicted Garner as Xavi Simons’ answer to a question about which Premier League player has surprised him most – “technical with the ball, he’s really, really good” – or that midway through the season we would be seeing a (bit of a) clamour for him to be called up by Thomas Tuchel for England amid questions as to whether Manchester United should re-sign him as an answer to the midfield conundrum.",

      "Surely the biggest Premier League revelation of all with his eight goals and five assists for Fulham. And he so very nearly made a deadline-day move to Leeds – a private jet was pre-emptively booked before talks broke down.",

      "Nine Premier League goals, eight of which have come in a run of nine games after Daniel Farke changed formation to stick another striker up top with him. The England clamour is real.",
      "",
      "Slim picking it’s fair to say but 12 goals in all competitions is a decent return for a striker most of us assumed wouldn’t get much of a look in this season.",
      "",
      "We assumed he was destined to be one of those ten-a-penny wingers who get close to the top by being very, very quick but not quite having it in the top two inches, but he’s developed his game to the point where he doesn’t just look like he could and should make the difference but actually does.",
      "",
      "There’s life in the old dog yet as this particular old dog is evidently desperate to represent his country at the World Cup, before seeing out his days lying balls-up on the sofa, only rising from his slumber for meals and to curl the occasional one out in the back garden, probably in Saudi Arabia.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe described Kieran Trippier’s “spontaneous” decision to hand Miley the armband for the final few minutes of their clash with PSV on Wednesday as “poignant” and also quite possibly a sign of what’s to come, dubbing the 19-year-old a “potential future captain of the football club”.",
      "There was a time – maybe even only a few weeks ago – when an injury to Bruno Guimaraes would have been an utter disaster for Newcastle. But the outstanding versatility and quality shown by Miley this season makes his absence feel manageable at the very least.",
      "",
      "You pal down the pub claiming they always knew Anderson would emerge as the answer to that age-old England problem is almost certainly telling porky pies. His Transfermarkt valuation has nearly doubled from £28m to £52m this season and that’s likely around half of what Manchester City will pay for his services after he conducts England to World Cup glory in the summer.",
      "",
      "There are few things we like more than a Premier League giant selling an academy star to a lower-league team before they return to the top flight to rub the mistake in their face. It’s a shame for us vengeance seekers that Ballard’s boyhood club Arsenal might be the only Premier League side he wouldn’t start for based on his outstanding form this season.",
      "",
      "He does next-to-nothing to help his side keep hold of the ball or get up the pitch, which is entirely as expected, but has also scored seven Premier League goals when we assumed he would be fortunate to score any as a bit-part player before escaping in January.",
      "",
      "We liked what we saw of him for Southampton last season, but it takes quite some mental fortitude not to crumble in this West Ham team, playing in that stadium, in front of those fans. Two relegations in two seasons won’t feel great, but Real Madrid interest in triggering his not-so-secret £20m release clause will.",
      "",
      "The only positive Wolves can take away from this season and the fans will if anything not want him to display too much more of his burgeoning talent for the rest of the campaign, lest he be pinched by a club set to still be playing Premier League football next term.",
      "Pundit Danny Murphy has explained why he thinks only one team is capable of stopping Arsenal winning the Champions League this season.",

      "Ornstein revealed in conversation with Duncan Castles on The Transfers Podcast: “Carrick will naturally enter the conversation depending on how well he does. But I don’t think this is binary, as it was with Ole Gunner Solskjaer. United should run their process properly: speak to available coaches, assess those in work where permitted, look at data, styles and profiles.",
      "“Last time, it came down to Thomas Tuchel and Erik ten Hag. Others like Frank and Pochettino were considered. There are weeks and months now to do that work. Carrick could play himself into contention, or he might decide it’s not the right moment.",
      "“There’s nothing firm right now. It’s hypothetical. But given his qualities, what he showed in his brief United spell before, and his work at Middlesbrough, there’s no reason he shouldn’t at least be in the conversation – much like Kieran McKenna was previously.",
      "“Carrick could be in the mix, but that doesn’t mean he’ll get the job. It’s very much a case of wait and see how it unfolds.”",
      "And Ornstein thinks Carrick ticks one crucial box for the Man Utd hierarchy as they look to bring in the right man to succeed Amorim in the summer.",
      "Ornstein added: “I also understand why United went for a figure with a connection to the club. Lifting spirits, restoring smiles and confidence matters, even if it sounds trite. It’s not everything, but it helps.",

      "As a Man United fan, 4-4-2 raised me. Two proper strikers (even though early Rooney and Ronaldo as mutated 10s and 9s still give me chills). Wingers who actually crossed and celebrated acrobatically after goals. Fullbacks who knew their only job was ‘run and vibes’.

      "In my view, much has been made of Arsenal’s reliance on set pieces this season, as evidence of a limited / pragmatic / neanderthal approach (take your pick). I think this misunderstands both the cause and the context.",
      "For the last decade and a half, elite football was dominated by positional, ball-heavy systems (70% possession, extreme technical prowess, territory control, cut-backs from the edge of the box) perfected by Guardiola’s genius. The natural response to that dominance for teams with lesser (but not insignificant) resources was resistance: better-coached mid-blocks, aggressive man-marking, and sophisticated rest-defence structures, especially among mid-table PL sides (who, remember, have more money and thus better players – not comparable to the best teams tactically, but fit for purpose of the type of game they planned to play).",
      "In other words, the league got better at stopping positional football.",
      "That tactical shift reduced open-play volume for everyone, including Arsenal (remember the fluent team of 22-23). Set pieces, IMO, are not the cause of this evolution but a rational response to it. Arsenal and a few others (notably Chelsea) have leaned into them because they are one of the few remaining repeatable advantages against compact, well-drilled defences.",
      "Arteta’s use of set pieces, to me, looks less like dogma and more like a stopgap i.e. an efficient (if not aesthetic) solution while the next attacking evolution is being worked out. Guardiola, interestingly, has not yet leaned into that lever to the same extent. His old road’s rapidly agin’, but if anyone can come up with an elegant solution, it’s him.",
      "The broader point is this: set-piece dominance is not evidence of regression. It is evidence of adaptation in a league where defensive organisation has finally caught up with positional purity (and I would say bettered it). A more elegant attacking solution will emerge. It always does. But dismissing the current phase as ‘set-piece FC’ misses the tactical story entirely.",

The point of using Dynasty as a term was not that it was a direct alternative to ‘DNA’ but because DNA is being used so ephemerally, with no concrete concepts other than attacking and exciting (which any team could say they want and have had iterations of their team that have done that before), but that Dynasty implies a one-time event.  It doesn’t flow over to a later version of the team 10, 20 or more years later. Whether we like ‘Americanisations’ or not, it better reflects what happens for teams that dominate an era than DNA. Especially when it is trotted out, again, after one win. My other point was that the confidence that oozed through a team of round pegs in round holes was far more instrumental in the win than DNA.",

      "Arsenal v Man United and Newcastle v Aston Villa are games that give us all a chance to stop and consider just how much things have changed since August, while also confirming that, for the millionth Premier League weekend in a row, it is once again officially Big. A Big Weekend.",
      "There’s also Mo Salah back in Premier League action post-AFCON, while who knows how many more chances we have left to enjoy Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace before he huffs right off for good?",
      "",
      "A fun thing about this weekend is that it’s the return fixtures from the opening game of the season. It’s just nice to see how different teams’ seasons have panned out and what clues or misdirections were evident back in the sunny days of August.",
      "At Old Trafford on the first Super Sunday of the season, Arsenal ran out slightly fortunate 1-0 winners in a game that prompted significant outpourings of optimism from home supporters despite the result.",
      "Arsenal, meanwhile, offered only unconvincing early evidence that this could at long last be their season, and Viktor Gyokeres looked like he might be a dud.",
      "It soon became clear that Man United were still quite cack, and that it was in fact Arsenal’s season. Good call on Gyokeres, though, who is truly Dud of Dud Hall.",
      "Ruben Amorim has gone, of course, and Michael Carrick continues his gentle start to life as United’s latest sacrificial Fergie Boy by attempting to follow up last weekend’s Arsenal-assisting win over Man City with a Man City-assisting win over Arsenal.",
      "If he does it, they’ll probably give him the permanent job on the spot, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "More likely is that Arsenal win in rather more convincing fashion than they did at Old Trafford and it all takes a little while longer before Carrick manages to stumble home in fifth and claim a Champions League spot on the back of the effort of the teams who are actually in it this season. And then gets appointed to the permanent job, because this is a football club that simply refuses to learn.",
      "Arsenal will by that point have long been crowned champions, with the bald truth that there really doesn’t seem like there’s much anyone else in the division can do about it. The bigger question is how many other pots and pans they might take home.",
      "",
      "Let’s continue the theme of August reminiscences, because in few places would the contrast appear more initially stark than at Aston Villa.",
      "They began the season with a grim goalless draw against the Newcastle side that had pipped them to Champions League football on the final day of 24/25 in a game that very much continued the trending themes at the time for two clubs who had endured awkward and unsatisfactory summers.",
      "For Villa it would set a trend that would extend into September and a five-game winless run to start the season that didn’t even contain a goal until that fifth game.",
      "Then they just won pretty much all the games for an extended period of time to become brief yet genuine title contenders.",
      "But the reopening of the transfer window has brought back familiar doubts and truths, and despite Villa occupying an enviable position in the table and appearing certainties for Champions League football next season there is now once again a distinct sense of a buzz harshed.",
      "Frustration at rules that bind them while being more easily navigated by the established big clubs, of simply not being allowed to compete on even terms with Newcastle, never mind the cosseted Big Six. Even the stupidest members of that group are annoying Villa. Especially the stupidest members.",
      "A look at the table suggests this angst is misplaced; Villa remain closer to Arsenal than they do to fifth place, which will almost certainly be enough to achieve what Villa set out to achieve this season and which they looked a million miles away from doing back in August.",
      "But time and results and other factors all have a funny way of shifting those sands beneath your feet. And with a slight dip in results and the return of the transfer window with its now familiar frustrations, there’s just a nagging sense that Villa are neither as happy as they should be, nor as they were just a few short weeks ago.",
      "",
      "Liverpool’s wildly unconvincing yet improbably lengthy unbeaten run featured a rarity on Wednesday night, as a truly convincing performance put a dangerous Marseille side to the sword in a richly deserved 3-0 triumph.",
      "Liverpool impressed from front to back, while Arne Slot got pretty much everything right as well in dealing with an awkward and ever-shifting opponent.",
      "But perhaps the best thing about the night for Liverpool was that at the end of it almost nobody was talking about Mo Salah. He went straight into the starting line-up on his return from AFCON and had neither an eye-catchingly good nor poor game – there was one glaring late miss which he somehow contrived to send away from goal rather than towards it, but apart from that.",
      "Yet it didn’t ever really feel like it was of desperate importance. It would have seemed mad to think a month ago when Salah left for AFCON with his entire Liverpool future seemingly up in the air that his return six weeks later could be so low-key, such a footnote on a night of good news.",
      "His first Premier League appearance since December 13 is likely to attract more eyeballs and greater attention, though. We eagerly await to discover what kind.",
      "",
      "We now know for sure it’s when not if as far as Glasner’s Palace exit is concerned. Technically it’s not supposed to happen until the end of the season, but it feels absurd to suggest this now clearly broken marriage can stagger on that long. Especially if Palace continue on their current downward trajectory that sees them without a Premier League win in their last seven games and suffering the FA Cup’s biggest ever giant-killing.",
      "Carrying on doesn’t look like it’s going to do much good for either Palace or Glasner in the long run. Palace find themselves now slipping uncomfortably close to the fringes of relegation bother, while continuing with Palace for much longer could yet see Glasner play himself out of what currently looks like a near-certain shot at a Big Six job next season.",
      "It’s not inconceivable that four of that group could be seeking a new permanent manager in the summer, and Glasner is high in the lists for all of those jobs.",
      "But he won’t be if he spends the next three months angrily losing to everyone to prove his undeniably valid point about the lack of support he’s received.",
      "If he’s not careful, he’ll end up with Tottenham as his best option, which would be a real daftness in the current climate.",
      "",
      "Funny old time for Middlesbrough, who are busy trying to get themselves back into the Premier League while watching their two most recent managers getting themselves appointed into it.",
      "Michael Carrick has failed upwards to Manchester United, while Rob Edwards surely couldn’t have imagined an undeniably impressive few months at the Riverside would so swiftly get him back in the big time.",
      "Boro have kept on keeping on, though, under Kim Hellberg and still firmly in the hunt for automatic promotion with the play-offs looking like a worst-case safety net.",
      "Preston are themselves still very much part of that picture, still just inside the top six going into this weekend despite consecutive defeats to Derby and Hull. This does feel like a pivotal spell of the season for their promotion hopes; after Boro comes another trip to a team eyeing an automatic return to the Premier League in Ipswich.",
      "",
      "Still an absurd amount of life left in the Serie A title race, where Inter now appear solid favourites but Roma down in fourth are still only seven points adrift and not without their chances.",
      "They surely can’t afford to slip 10 points off Inter’s pace and also fall seven points adrift of Milan this weekend, though. Victory over the team in second would lift them within a single point of Milan, which itself seems an oddity given Milan have lost one league game all season while Roma have already lost seven.",
      "What Roma simply refuse to do at all, you see, is draw. Milan love a draw, so let’s see how this pans out.",
      "",
      "A clash between the two recent powerhouses of English women’s football that neither can afford to lose.",
      "Chelsea cannot afford to let a flying Man City get any further away from them, while for third-placed Arsenal the concern now is more behind them than in front. Spurs are level on points with them, and Man United only a point further back in what appears to be a three-horse race for the final Champions League spot.",
      "With Spurs facing bottom-of-the-table Liverpool this weekend and United doing so next weekend, Arsenal could do really do with a result this weekend to keep them at bay.",
      "Paul Scholes will be neither apologising nor shutting up about Lisandro Martinez, while Manchester United have ‘revealed’ a four-man midfielder shortlist.",
      "Michael Carrick loves his DNA but probably won’t be bringing back a Manchester United tactic which ‘broke Arsenal’ for a few fairly obvious reasons.",
      "Mikel Arteta has meticulously removed three monkeys from his back this season – and has an unexpected shot at another when Arsenal face Manchester United.",
      "We know Oliver Glasner will leave Crystal Palace at the end of the season (or sooner) but who is set to take over?",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after a run of drab Premier League draws. And now Xabi Alonso is available…",
      "Michael Carrick is the interim manager of Manchester United but will he be in charge next season?"

      "Signed from Real Madrid for over £60million in August 2022, Casemiro penned a four-year contract, with the option of an additional year, worth more than £300,000 per week.",
      "At the time, the Erik ten Hag signing was viewed as a solid one. Casemiro had established himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in the world at Madrid, where he won five Champions League titles.",
      "However, signing a 30-year-old for such a monumental fee, on such high wages, for a minimum of four years, was always a financial risk and not a particularly wise one.",

      "The Real Madrid legend thrived in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has remained a key player since Michael Carrick took charge for the remainder of his United career.",
      "With just over four months left at Old Trafford, Casemiro has no silverware left to play for but will hope to help guide the club back into the Champions League.",
      "There are no concrete reports linking Casemiro with a specific summer move, but a switch to Saudi Arabia makes the most sense.",

      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a potential exit from Man Utd over the past year.",
      "In the summer, a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely as they tried to sign him ahead of the Club World Cup for a fee in the region of £100m.",
      "It was also suggested that Man Utd officials were open to sanctioning his exit, as this transfer would have raised funds for further business. However, Fernandes opted against the move at the time as he was keen to continue playing at the top level.",

      "‘However, the club’s preference is to keep their captain in what will be another transitional summer with a new permanent manager set to arrive to replace Ruben Amorim.’",
      "Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich have also been mooted as a potential destination for Fernandes, but a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims an ‘historic offer’ from Al-Hilal has ‘dramatically changed’ the situation.",

      "‘The scenario changes dramatically when Al Hilal enters the picture. The Saudi Arabian club is poised to make history and turn Bruno Fernandes into one of the highest-paid footballers of all time. The offer being prepared in Riyadh surpasses any known standard, both in salary and media impact.",
      "‘Al Hilal wants Bruno to be the face of their international project, a symbolic signing that would reinforce the Saudi league’s image as a destination for established stars. For the Portuguese player, the offer would be virtually impossible to refuse from a financial standpoint, placing him among a select few footballers in history.’",
      "It is also said that the final decision regarding Fernandes hinges on three ‘factors’; ‘the sporting project presented by Manchester United, Bayern Munich’s ability to entice him with their competitive offerings, and, above all, the size of the Saudi Arabian offer’.",

Without Fernandes, United suddenly get a lot worse but also far less interesting. They will need a replacement ready to come in and light up Old Trafford and Palmer is one of very few we would fancy to thrive in that spotlight.",

      "Does Palmer even get in Rosenior’s best team right now? Ludicrous question though it may seem, in the new manager’s preferred shape, there is room for only one attacking midfielder ahead of a double-pivot. Which pits Palmer against Enzo Fernandes for the no.10 position.",
      "Palmer has played off the right flank for Chelsea but, unquestionably, he is best used centrally. The same is true, though, of the Blues’ £107million Argentinian investment. And Rosenior is unlikely to grant Palmer the freedom to roam off the right that Mauricio Pochettino afforded him in 2023/24.",
      "Not only could United offer Palmer his Manchester home comforts – assuming that is as relevant as some are suggesting – but if Fernandes is not long for Old Trafford, the no.10 position would be his.",

      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",

      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",

Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",

      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",

      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, it’s now six points from their last four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley in what is fast becoming the world’s least convincing unbeaten run ever.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but still five points away despite West Ham collecting the inevitable from a trip to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",

      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take further signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers.

      "After the latest check on the pulse of the nation with regard to Mason Greenwood’s return to Manchester United, we can confirm that people remain grimly fascinated by the possibility and that it’s still really not OK.",
      "It’s an uncomfortable truth that football journalists are now all too aware of that Greenwood is a name which does good business. In part because he’s an excellent footballer who looks destined for great(er) things, but also because of the manner of his exit from Old Trafford and how his possible return continues to split opinion.",
      "Greenwood faced charges for rape and assault in October 2022 but the Crown Prosecution Service discontinued the case against him four months later after the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction. He was not – as Greenwood said in a statement afterwards – “cleared” of the charges. We all heard the audio.",
      "Manchester United tested the waters. They gave inside scoops detailing his reintegration into the squad and were met with disgust from fans and (some) members of the media.",
      "In a lengthy statement, Female Fans Against Greenwood’s Return said the possible return of Greenwood “tells us, as women, that we don’t matter”.",
      "It added: “It tells us that men who make the club money matter; not us, our fellow fans, mothers, sisters or daughters.”",
      "To avoid a PR disaster, Greenwood was sent to Getafe on a season-long loan, before – after further suggestions that he may return to Man Utd were shot down – he was sold to Marseille for £26m in the summer of 2024.",
      "And now 42 goals in 63 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, links to Barcelona and Premier League alternatives, and sell-on and buy-back clauses combine to make his future a particularly intriguing prospect for click-hungry websites. We’re aware that we’re having and eating cake.",
      "Thursday morning saw multiple old Greenwood articles re-nosed for publication. What’s ‘Tuchel’s stance on an England recall’? Still a hard no. We particularly enjoyed Jurgen Klopp ‘making his feelings clear on Greenwood’ as one outlet looked to crowbar two of the most Google-able names into the same headline.",
      "The flurry was no coincidence. Editors will have been on at their minions to push Greenwood on the back of him facing Liverpool for Marseille last night, sensing an opportunity for traffic with him front of mind for more English fans than usual. They will have been praying for a goal or two from the 24-year-old to provide a further boost.",
      "One report claims ‘Man United officials have internally discussed the idea of bringing Mason Greenwood back to the club’. Who says? ‘Sources’ do. Could be groundsman No. 5 or – because it’s not ‘club sources’, just ‘sources’ – literally anyone. I’m a source, you’re a source.",
      "That’s preferential on a moral level than if the ‘news’ has come from inside Manchester United, as that would suggest that they are again looking to gauge public opinion over his possible return. Newsflash guys: it’s never going to change.",
      "People who believe he deserves a second chance and that everyone makes mistakes, who sign up to the view that ‘she’s OK with it so why aren’t you?’ left their morals at the door long ago and aren’t about to recover them.",

      "There are a couple of league tables that feel pretty significant this morning.",
      "The first is a Champions League table that has five Premier League teams camped inside the all-important top eight, and a non-zero chance that after the matchday-eight madness that number is actually six.",
      "And then there’s the newly published Deloitte Football Money League that has every member of the Premier League’s Big Six inside its top 10, with only the continental behemoths of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain ahead.",
      "Perhaps more striking still is that three more Premier League sides – Aston Villa, Newcastle and West Ham – all make the top 20. And it only gets more absurd the further down the list you go; half the top 30 are Premier League teams. Brentford had higher revenues in 24/25 than any South American club.",
      "It’s a reminder, along with the recent domestic struggles of your Tottenhams and Manchester Uniteds in an increasingly competitive division, of just how huge the Premier League’s baked-in advantage over the rest of Europe and therefore the world now is.",
      "There is no other country that could even conceive of having six teams cruising through the Champions League league stage as the English clubs have this season. A quick look at the worst-performing team from the other big leagues – none of whom, of course, have as many as six entrants to begin with – is stark.",
      "Villarreal sit second bottom with just a point to their name after seven games. Eintracht Frankfurt have fared little better and are also out of contention altogether before the final matchday of a league format specifically and deliberately designed to minimise jeopardy. Napoli currently sit outside the top 24.",
      "And even above them, any or all of Marseille, Leverkusen, Monaco and Athletic Club could yet tumble and miss even the play-off safety net.",
      "England’s worst-performing team is Manchester City, who even in the absolute worst-case scenario can now finish no lower than 18th.",
      "And this at a time when five of the Big Six would consider themselves to be, in general, underperforming this season. Even not in peak condition, these six teams remain among the very best in the Champions League, their superiority baked in yet further by the added advantage of being kept apart from each other throughout the league phase. Five Champions League places already feels inevitable for next season.",
      "Tottenham are the 14th best team in England but the fifth best in the entire continent. You’re tempted to say ‘make it make sense’ but it’s actually pretty depressingly easy to make it make sense. The bloated Champions League league stage is a lower overall standard than the Premier League.",
      "The only real surprise in Spurs’ lofty standing is the fact three Premier League teams sit below them.",
      "You could chuck plenty more Premier League teams into the Champions League and they would most likely also finish in the top 24 qualifying positions.",
      "Aston Villa and Manchester United most obviously, but really anyone currently above Spurs in the table has proof of concept.",
      "There are other factors of course. There’s little doubt that Spurs specifically are playing with far greater freedom with the pressure off to an extent in a Champions League where relatively little is expected of them and failure is legitimately hard to achieve; they are clearly less burdened and shackled by fear and tension on European nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where they haven’t lost any of their last 24 games, than on Premier League days.",
      "The fact Spurs have won as many Champions League games as Premier League games on their own patch since the start of 2025 is both hilarious and ridiculous, but also revealing.",
      "English clubs, in truth, underperformed in last season’s Champions League. Yet they still produced a semi-finalist, a quarter-finalist and a team that dominated the league stage only to find themselves unfortunate to come up against what was by the time of the first knockout round the best team in the competition.",
      "And it still took members of the tiny handful of European powerhouses who can still vaguely compete with any of the Premier League big guns on an even keel to eliminate them: Real Madrid knocked out Man City, and PSG took care of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – notably finding each of them far harder nuts to crack than finalists Inter.",
      "And the three members of the Premier League’s Big Six who found themselves outside the Big Cup just casually dominated the lesser trophies, with Spurs beating Man United in the Europa League final and Chelsea winning the Conference League while yawning and absent-mindedly scratching their arse throughout.",
      "But the Deloitte numbers also show why, even now as it feels like it’s disintegrating on the Premier League pitch, it is still correct to talk about the Big Six. Spurs’ revenues still dwarf those of Villa and Newcastle, never mind supposed European giants like Atletico Madrid or Juve or the Milan clubs.",
      "The fact Villa’s wage bill is significantly higher than Tottenham’s – and terrifyingly close to Manchester United’s – is a sign of a problem approaching rapidly over the hill for the midlands club rather than evidence they have compellingly displaced silly Spurs.",
      "And here too another reminder that while Villa’s frustration and anger at what they perceive as rules designed to protect that Big Six and force them to operate with one hand behind their back is understandable, their direction for that irritation is entirely misplaced.",
      "Villa should not look at Spurs and think ‘unfair’. They should look at Spurs as the example to follow. Not on the pitch, obviously. Don’t do that, whatever you do. But off the pitch.",
      "For all their myriad faults, their undeniable and unending banter-club status, the one thing Spurs have got impressively right over the last two decades is making that elite cabal a Big Six in the first place, and how they went about it. Say what you like about Spurs – and we do, frequently – but they did not bet the house on shortcutting their way in as Villa are currently attempting or follow Newcastle’s own dubious attempt at the Man City or Chelsea approach.",
      "And that’s why even now, as Spurs reel around on the fringes of a genuine relegation fight and Villa have at this time thoroughly and conspicuously overtaken them on the pitch, those Deloitte numbers and Champions League table still tell a tale of how and why the idea of the Big Six persists and prevails."

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage reaching the Christmas break, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results across all three competitions.",
      "All six of England’s Champions League representatives are now assured of play-off spots at worst. Arsenal will definitely finish in the top eight and go straight to the last 16, while it’s not inconceivable that all of the other five could do so. Remember, there are bonus points on offer based on your finishing positions and last-16 participation, so that will all help boost the pot.",
      "Villa and Forest are in good shape in the Europa League, while Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "Total points: 125.375\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nPlay-off round: Crystal Palace (UECL)\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL)",
      "",
      "Yes, it’s a surprise name currently in second place until you scratch the surface. First, with only four teams in European competition every individual win is worth half a point. Add in the fact that all four of Poland’s teams are in the Conference, where the league stage is over and the bonus points for finishing positions dished out, and it all starts to make sense.",
      "Will obviously fall off as the stagger unwinds, but they will still be picking up points here and there for a while yet.",
      "Total points: 54.500\nTotal teams: Four\nTeams still active: Three\nLast 16: Rakow Częstochowa (UECL)\nPlay-off round: Lech Poznan, Jagiellonia Bialystok (both UECL)\nEliminated: Legia Warsaw (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",

But the big three will all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night teams.",

      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick is relishing the opportunity for his side to prove themselves against league leaders Arsenal after a dream start at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",

      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",

      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United in the summer. His estimated cost to the club £119m. The Athletic asks whether he was worth it",
      "By Mark Critchley, The Athletic",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 18:41, UK",
      "Spending at least £60m in transfer fees on a 30-year-old, giving him a salary of up to £350,000-per-week, and signing him to a four-year contract with the option of a further 12 months would not typically be viewed as cost-effective business.",
      "That is at least partly why Manchester United will not be triggering said option in Casemiro's contract. His Old Trafford career will instead come to an end this summer, as had long been expected.",
      "Once he says goodbye, after adding to his 146 appearances, many will hold up Casemiro's time in Manchester as another symbol of United's waste and extravagance in the transfer market, and a starry-eyed infatuation with big-name, big-money players who arrive well past their peak.",
      "There is undoubtedly some truth to that, but even if he may not have been a particularly smart signing, Casemiro was arguably a necessary one. And though four seasons of a five-time Champions League winner was never going to come cheap, it would also be unfair to dismiss him as a costly mistake.",
      "If anything, the cost was a symptom of United's desperation and dysfunction during Erik ten Hag's tumultuous first summer in charge, with his signing from Real Madrid being quickly accelerated after back-to-back defeats in their opening Premier League games.",
      "The long, protracted and painful pursuit of Frenkie de Jong had run aground by that point. Champions League qualification needed to be delivered at all costs.",
      "Ultimately, it was, thanks in no small part to Casemiro. For that first year in Manchester, certainly for the first six months of his Old Trafford career, he was considered a transformative addition.",
      "The arrival of one of the best No 6s of his generation finally addressed a longstanding problem at the base of midfield. Even if his age meant he was not going to be a long-term solution, his quality and experience meant he was a quick, effective fix.",
      "At his best for United, around the time of the Carabao Cup final victory over Newcastle United that February, he was being uncontroversially hailed in some quarters as the club's most important signing since Eric Cantona.",
      "Casemiro's second season was much more of a struggle, though, and has coloured perceptions of his United career away from Old Trafford. On several occasions, he no longer looked capable of keeping up with the pace of the Premier League, and those stuck in the craw.",
      "Though far from the only player to have difficulties meeting the demands of Ten Hag's increasingly helter-skelter style of play, it did him absolutely no favours as a holding midfielder on the wrong side of 30 and exposed the short-termism of his signing.",
      "He didn't, though. And even after being cast to the peripheries by Ten Hag's successor, at one stage finding himself behind a 21-year-old Toby Collyer in the pecking order, his dedication and determination to win back his place led him to practically become an ever-present again. From then on, he was an example Ruben Amorim would constantly tell his other players to follow.",
      "Last week, The Athletic revealed that Casemiro's option would be automatically triggered if he started every remaining game this season. The chances of that were remote. Even if United had been open to another year, even if their shrinking budgets could afford it, injury or suspension would likely have got in the way. But on form alone, it was not such an outlandish prospect.",
      "Casemiro has started 19 of 24 matches in all competitions this season, including all but one of the Premier League games that he has been available for. Despite the justified clamour for Kobbie Mainoo to be given more opportunities, few argued that should come at the 33-year-old's expense.",
      "When part of more compact and conservative tactical setups than Ten Hag's, he has generally looked capable of continuing to play at a high level.",
      "His considerable threat from set pieces has left him with a respectable tally of 21 goals since joining. And though he could be erratic with his passing, there were often nights over the past three and a half years when he looked like the only United player other than Bruno Fernandes capable of creating something.",
      "Thursday's announcement that he will leave at the end of the season followed a man-of-the-match display in the 198th Manchester derby. It was only the latest example that Casemiro still has something to offer United, albeit not on his current pay packet.",
      "Even without the one-year option triggered, a rough estimate puts the minimum cost to United of first signing and then keeping Casemiro for the past four seasons at £119m ($160m). Was it worth it? Opinions will vary.",
      "But here's something more of us can agree on: United have been a better team when Casemiro is playing. This season, especially. And now, he must be replaced.",
      "There is a different set of decision-makers in place at Old Trafford compared to the summer of 2022, and they will surely look for a younger and more athletic midfielder, with a higher ceiling in terms of what they can achieve as a United player, and a higher resale value if they fall short of that mark. A smarter signing, we'll all surely agree.",
      "Like Casemiro, that midfielder - whether it is Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba or another target - won't come cheap. And to avoid any sort of drop-off next season, they will need to be as dependable at the base of United's midfield as the man they are replacing has been for most of his eventful Old Trafford career.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has 18 months remaining on his Manchester United contract, plus the option of a further year; 20-year-old did not start a Premier League game this season under Ruben Amorim but was restored to the XI in Michael Carrick's first game",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Vik Varange",
      "Friday 23 January 2026 11:58, UK",
      "On the day when United confirmed that one key midfielder will leave Old Trafford, with the soon-to-be-34-year-old Casemiro departing at the end of this season, it can now be revealed they are keen to tie down another, much younger, midfielder with a vastly improved deal.",
      "It is understood there has been initial contact with Mainoo's representatives, with a plan to sit down and discuss the details of a new and improved contract - one which would see his wages brought more in line with his team-mates and his standing at the club.",
      "Having come through United's academy, Mainoo's salary is among the smallest of all the members of the first-team squad. But with the 20-year-old not part of former head coach Ruben Amorim's plans, and with 18 months remaining on his current deal - plus a further year option - it was not seen as a priority for the club to open fresh talks.",
      "Mainoo did not start a single Premier League match this season under Amorim but was selected at the first opportunity by new head coach Michael Carrick last weekend as he put in an impressive performance as United beat City 2-0 in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"It's a significant time.",
      "\"On the day Manchester United announce Casemiro will be leaving the club at the end of the season, the club want to tie down another, much younger player in Mainoo, who they see as a key player for the future.",
      "\"It's a significant change for Mainoo.",
      "\"Under previous coach Ruben Amorim, he didn't start a single game this season.",
      "\"There was also interest in him in Europe but Michael Carrick has come in and he starred in the win over Manchester City.",
      "\"Manchester United now feel that this is the right time, while they are putting their house in order, they want to tie down some of their younger players who are important to the club's future. Mainoo is at the heart of it.\"",
      "The Mainoo news comes as Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season, ending a four-year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "As SSN previously reported in the autumn, Casemiro is one of the highest earners in the squad and it was unlikely United would renew his contract as the freed up wage capacity will allow more space for future investment/signings in the midfield area.",
      "Casemiro has had a renaissance at the club in the last 12 months. After being out of the team under Ruben Amorim initially, he was praised by Amorim for his willingness to fight for his place and has been a key part of the team since then - he started the Manchester derby under Michael Carrick in his first game as well.",
      "Looking ahead to the summer, Manchester United have an interest in the likes of Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton.",
      "\"It's very interesting because we knew Casemiro's contract was running out this summer.",
      "\"Harry Maguire is also someone to talk about because his contract also runs out this summer. No fresh talks have happened with him, either.",
      "\"But especially with Casimiro, he is one of the highest earners at the club, and with that freed up wage space, we've been reporting in not just this window how Manchester United are targeting the summer to reinforce their midfield.",
      "\"We've already talked about the likes of Adam Wharton at Crystal Palace, Carlos Baleba at Brighton, Elliot Anderson and Nottingham Forest, to name a few.",
      "\"And through INEOS taking really control of the football operations, they've tried to change the way structures are streamlined a lot more.",
      "\"They're hoping that all of this capacity freed up can allow for more signings in the future, and with the midfield as a priority, it will mean that they definitely have to now sign someone in the summer.",
      "\"They'll only have Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, who looks like a new player under Michael Carrick, based on the Manchester derby.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes, now moving to No 10, they won't have many options in that position. INEOS will have to act quickly.\"",

      "🔴 Jesus over Gyokeres for Arsenal?💪 Miley's versatility for Newcastle🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Gabriel Jesus and Viktor Gyokeres were seen to have given Mikel Arteta a selection dilemma against Manchester United in Arsenal's win over Inter Milan. But what if their goalscoring displays actually proved their suitability to their roles on the night?",
      "Arsenal looked a far more fluid attacking force with Jesus starting up front. The flurry of passes that led to their opening goal was untypical of Mikel Arteta's side this season and included a deft lay-off from Jesus to Mikel Merino before his instinctive finish.",
      "Jesus continued to knit things together, pulling to the flanks to combine with Arsenal's wide players, creating space for Eberechi Eze, feeding team-mates with his back to goal and, at one point, even driving forward with the ball and playing Bukayo Saka through.",
      "His performance, on only his third start this season, was reminiscent of the electrifying displays that followed his arrival from Manchester City in 2022, before the first in a succession of injuries struck.",
      "There was a set-piece goal too, of course, as he nodded his second over the line from a corner. But it was in open play that his impact was most apparent. Arsenal looked a different proposition thanks to their striker's imagination and technical security.",
      "They are qualities Gyokeres lacks. But by coming into the game as a substitute, when Inter were chasing an equaliser, he was able to show what he can do, attacking space on the break to latch onto Gabriel Martinelli's ball in behind before finishing superbly.",
      "It was a goal Jesus probably wouldn't have scored. Just as the opening goal by Jesus, with the intricate interplay that preceded it, was one Gyokeres probably wouldn't have scored.",
      "The first half of the season has exposed the limitations in Gyokeres's game. But it is also true that the conditions he found for his goal on Tuesday have rarely been available to him in the Premier League, where space is at a premium and compactness reigns.",
      "The moments when opponents become stretched tend to occur late in games, when they are tiring and, often, chasing goals. By that point, Gyokeres, who has started all but three of his 20 Premier League appearances so far, has usually been substituted.",
      "Arteta's hand has been forced, at least to some extent. Injuries to Jesus and Kai Havertz left Gyokeres as his only available striker for much of the season. But the option to change his role is there for the Arsenal manager now and the need for it is clear.",
      "Arsenal have won 13 out of 17 league games with Gyokeres starting but that is largely thanks to a reliance on set-pieces. They have only scored 13 open-play goals in those 17 games compared to 10 in the other five. There is a gap in open-play expected goals too.",
      "It is no coincidence that many of Arsenal's best and most fluent attacking performances this season, against Bayern Munich, Tottenham and now Inter Milan, have come when Arteta has started with either Mikel Merino or Jesus in the No 9 role over Gyokeres.",
      "Like Havertz, they bring more in the role. More touches, more passes, more duel-winning ability and, perhaps most damningly, more goals. Erling Haaland proves low-touch volume is not necessarily an issue for a striker. But only if that striker is scoring.",
      "Gyokeres, without a non-penalty Premier League goal since November 1, is simply not doing that. In his 17 starts up front in the competition, he has a worse shot conversion rate than any of the players with whom he is competing for the No 9 spot at Arsenal.",
      "All of which is not to say Gyokeres cannot be useful to Arteta. It might just require a recalibration of his role.",
      "At £64m, it is safe to assume he was not signed to be a substitute. But it is surely better to use him in the manner in which he can be most effective, as a relentless runner against tiring defences, than wait for him to become something he is not.",
      "Of course, the situation might look different had Havertz been available to share the minutes up front, instead of joining Jesus on the sidelines with a knee injury in August. A lighter workload, and more outings off the bench, might have suited Gyokeres better.",
      "It also would have made life easier for Arteta.",
      "Havertz's finishing has been a source of frustration to Arsenal supporters during his time at the club. But while the signing of Gyokeres was intended to add greater cutting edge, Havertz surely remains their first choice in the position when available.",
      "It is worth noting that at the time of the groin injury that curtailed his season last term, Havertz had scored 15 goals, putting him on track for the highest-scoring campaign of his club career.",
      "Across 31 Premier League starts as a forward for Arsenal overall, he has 24 goal involvements, with 15 goals and nine assists. And that is on top of everything else he brings to the role.",
      "They are hugely impressive numbers which underline the potential significance of a return to fitness which, frustratingly for Arsenal, is taking longer than expected. Havertz was an unused substitute against Nottingham Forest and Inter despite previously making cameos in the wins over Portsmouth and Chelsea.",
      "Jesus, of course, is still only recently returned from injury too.",
      "But if it is a choice between him or Gyokeres against Manchester United, events at the San Siro might have shown the way forward.",
      "The potential absence of Bruno Guimaraes against Aston Villa on Sunday following his injury against PSV Eindhoven is a worry for Newcastle. But in Lewis Miley they do at least have a player ready to step in and deliver whatever is asked of him.",
      "The 19-year-old ensured their captain was not missed in the second half of Wednesday's game. Having displayed maturity and composure in midfield, he ended up at right-back, taking the captain's armband off Kieran Trippier as he went off.",
      "It was a special moment for the academy product, who has been switching between positions all season. Having impressed as a makeshift right-back, he might now be needed back in midfield, where he has already slotted into a variety of different roles.",
      "Will Bryan Mbeumo be used as a No 9 again when Manchester United go to the Emirates Stadium on the back of their win in the Manchester derby? He can cause problems for the team against whom he made his United debut back in August.",
      "The last column made the case for Manchester United's new head coach Michael Carrick to go on the attack against Manchester City, something he did to great effect. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes's return to No 10 and Antoine Semenyo's impact.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "Enzo Le Fée has quietly slipped under the radar of wider footballing circles but not the eyes of Sunderland supporters.",
      "Le Fée's season pivoted the moment he was moved into a more central role. Freed from the touchline and given licence to operate between the lines, his influence has surged. He's dictating tempo, demanding the ball and, most importantly for this bet, shooting more. The numbers back it up.",
      "Le Fée has scored in his last two matches and across that run has hit four shots on target.",
      "At 5/4 with Sky Bet to hit one or more shots on target the market still hasn't caught up with his positional shift or his growing assertiveness in the final third.",
      "A 1-1 draw with Liverpool doesn't mask the bigger picture for Burnley, which is damning. Across all the key underlying metrics, Burnley sit rock-bottom in the Premier League. Expected goals for, expected goals against, shots conceded, box entries allowed - it's a clean sweep of concern.",
      "Spurs' ceiling is miles higher than Burnley's. When they click, they can overwhelm teams. Tuesday's win over Borussia Dortmund was a reminder of what this side can look like when intensity meets quality. Aggressive pressing, fast ball movement and a very solid structure in defence.",
      "Playing away from home hasn't been a negative for Spurs this season - quite the opposite. They've already gone to Manchester City, Crystal Palace, Leeds and Everton and come back with wins. The idea that Turf Moor is an impenetrable fortress doesn't stack up against this Spurs profile.",
      "The Evens for an away win looks generous.",
      "We can get very caught up in just picking a side in the prediction game. Home win or away win. But sometimes the smartest bet is the one nobody wants to back - and Fulham vs Brighton has draw written all over it.",
      "Just one point separates these two in the Premier League. Both teams are capable of beating good sides on their day, but neither consistently dominates teams of a similar level. When Fulham and Brighton face opponents in this bracket, games tend to settle into long spells of balance.",
      "The draw is the biggest price of the three outcomes and it's the bet nobody wants to back. Punters gravitate towards winners. Bookmakers know that. So, draw prices often drift organically beyond where the true probability sits, especially in evenly matched fixtures like this. It can be backed here at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is a fixture that automatically drags the goal line up. Manchester City at home, Wolves in town. The market instinctively leans towards a goal-heavy afternoon. But backing this Wolves defence under Rob Edwards has quietly become a profitable strategy. They're tighter, better organised, and far more disciplined without the ball. Over their last eight Premier League games, Wolves rank second best for expected goals against. That's elite defensive process.",
      "Then factor in Manchester City's week. Chaotic is the word. Distractions, noise, pressure and that often leads to pragmatism rather than expression. City don't need to win big here. Any win will do. Control, manage, move on.",
      "Yet, at 1/5 with Sky Bet they are a favourite worth swerving. Of those two win market options, I'd much rather back a Wolves win at 10/1.",
      "That opens up multiple paths for an under goals bet and it's the under 3.5 line at 4/5 with Sky Bet that stands out as the main play.",
      "Florian Wirtz's start to life in the Premier League has been a slow burn - but the signs are starting to show that we must start paying attention to him across the prop markets.",
      "The early weeks after his £116m summer move from Leverkusen were awkward. New league, new tempo, new expectations. All that jazz.",
      "Wirtz's end product has caught fire recently though. He's now averaging close to a goal involvement every 102 minutes across his last eight appearances in all competitions.",
      "After failing to score in his first 22 Liverpool appearances, he's now hit the net in four of his last seven. That's a player finding rhythm, timing and trust in his surroundings.",
      "He is 8/1 to open the scoring with Sky Bet.",
      "Some bets don't need overcomplicating. You look at the venue, you look at the numbers and the picture becomes clear. Brentford at home is one of those situations and the 10/11 with Sky Bet against Nottingham Forest is very hard to turn down.",
      "The Gtech has quietly become one of the toughest places to go in the Premier League. Brentford have taken 24 points from a possible 33 at home, the fourth-best home record in the division. That's not built on soft fixtures either, it's a repeatable edge driven by structure, intensity and crowd energy.",
      "Brentford are aggressive in duels, strong in second balls and ruthless in moments that matter. They turn games into uncomfortable experiences for visiting teams.",
      "Oliver Glasner's impending departure at the end of the season matters. Even the most professional squads feel it when leadership has an expiry date. Messages lose a fraction of their bite. It doesn't mean Palace will down tools but it does mean focus can blur at the margins and at this level fine margins decide Premier League games.",
      "Chelsea, fresh from their own off-field shake-up, arrive with something Palace lack right now: clarity. No looming exits. No major distractions. Just points to chase and a clear objective under Liam Rosenior to finish in the Champions League places. In matches like this, that mental clarity is an underrated edge and does make Chelsea an interesting betting proposal at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Joelinton and emotional control have always lived on opposite sides of the street. He plays on the edge because Newcastle need him to. Intensity, duels, aggression - it's his job description. And against Aston Villa, that edge has repeatedly tipped into yellow card territory.",
      "Joelinton has been booked in five of the last seven meetings between Newcastle and Villa. That's not a coincidence. Villa bring the kind of technical ball carriers and intelligent movers that force Joelinton into recovery challenges, late tackles and tactical fouls.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins are card magnets. Since the start of last season, that trio have collectively drawn 48 cards from opposition players. They're clever with their movement, sharp on the turn and excellent at inviting contact in dangerous areas.",
      "The 9/4 with Sky Bet for Joelinton to be carded is a serious runner.",
      "Bukayo Saka's current run of 12 games without a goal in all competitions is his joint-longest drought for Arsenal. From a surface view, that type of run would put people off selecting him in the goalscorer markets. But I see it differently. Trends in football always snap. And timing is everything when it comes to snapping them for profit.",
      "Saka is still Arsenal's creative heartbeat, the outlet for danger and the player most likely to exploit half-chances in the final third. Arsenal are likely to control large portions of this game and Saka will be central to creating or finishing chances.",
      "From a betting standpoint, the question isn't whether Saka will score eventually - it's when. This looks the time to jump on at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin facing Everton for the first time in his career is a classic \"ex-factor\" scenario. A player with motivation, familiarity and unfinished business - all variables that can't be factored into his goalscorer prices. Add in his current form and this becomes a very juicy angle for punters. Calvert-Lewin has been in electric mood. Eight goals in his last 10 Premier League appearances underline his finishing sharpness and consistency.",
      "He's leading the line for a Leeds team that have netted 17 goals in their last nine Premier League games - second only to Manchester City (18), which paints a picture of a confident team. You can get 2/1 on Calvert-Lewin finding the net.",

      "Casemiro's Old Trafford departure will bring a four-year stay at Manchester United to an end; 33-year-old's deal at Old Trafford expires this summer; during his time at Man Utd, the midfielder has won both the FA Cup and Carabao Cup as well as reaching a Europa League final in 2025",
      "Thursday 22 January 2026 18:29, UK",
      "Casemiro will leave Manchester United at the end of the season upon the expiry of his current deal at Old Trafford.",
      "The announcement of his departure brings an end to a four-year stay at Old Trafford, which has seen him score in a League Cup final victory in 2023 and reach two FA Cup finals, winning the competition in 2024.",
      "Casemiro was also part of the United side that reached the Europa League final in May of last season.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder signed for the club in August 2022 and United had the option to trigger a 12-month extension at the end of the season.",
      "The decision also gives Casemiro clarity for the rest of the season as he also prepares to represent Brazil in the World Cup in the summer.",
      "\"I will carry Manchester United with me throughout my entire life,\" Casemiro said in a statement.",
      "\"From the first day that I walked out at this beautiful stadium, I felt the passion of Old Trafford and the love that I now share with our supporters for this special club.",
      "\"It is not time to say goodbye; there are many more memories to create during the next four months.",
      "\"We still have a lot to fight for together; my complete focus will, as always, remain on giving my everything to help our club to succeed.\"",
      "\"Leave the football before the football leaves you. The football has left him.\" The words of Jamie Carragher aimed at Casemiro after the Brazilian's disastrous performance in a harrowing 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace. Casemiro was all over the place and his legs had gone - as had his confidence.",
      "There was a feeling that the midfielder United had splashed £70m on in 2022 was no longer fit for purpose. Now, as he approaches his Old Trafford swansong, he leaves with his reputation fully intact.",
      "Some eyebrows were raised when a 30-year-old five-time Champions League winner traded the Spanish capital for a spot in Erik ten Hag's Manchester United.",
      "However, a stellar first season that saw United finish third was some justification as a 'quick fix' appeared a stroke of real genius. Naturally on the wane, tougher seasons and poorer performances would follow but his importance would remain a fixture.",
      "Leaning on his experience, Ruben Amorim grew to rely on Casemiro in midfield after initially opting against fielding the veteran. Important goals like the one that helped United end a six-year trophy drought in the form of a Carabao Cup continued as Casemiro would prove clutch across various periods.",
      "Now Michael Carrick, a world-class midfielder himself during his playing career, has also recognised his importance as Casemiro started and impressed in his derby-day bow at Old Trafford.",
      "Success is relative, especially in regards to what Manchester United are now compared to the Real Madrid side Casemiro left. However, like Raphael Varane before him who made the same switch, Casemiro's significance in a side battling through transition will be a point in his career he looks back on fondly.",

      "There is a battle going on for several top strikers across Europe.",
      "Centre-forwards are wanted in every transfer window and always come at a premium, but this month several very good ones are on the market and some big clubs are circling.",
      "But do not rule out other clubs emerging either as it gets closer to the deadline, which is just 11 days away.",
      "Clubs interested: Juventus, Aston Villa",
      "Mateta has told Crystal Palace he wants to leave the club this month. He has wanted to leave since last summer when multiple clubs tried to sign him and he did not agree a new contract with Palace.",
      "The strongest team on him has been Juventus, but they have other options too such as Youssef En Nesyri. Aston Villa are also interested in Mateta but appear to be prioritising Tammy Abraham at Besiktas. Those two are not the only clubs.",
      "However, Crystal Palace are not actively trying to sell Mateta and it would require a significant offer for the club to be tempted to sell.",
      "They still value Mateta around £35m and, as things stand, an exit is not close. In the background is uncertainty around head coach Oliver Glasner and the club are trying to stabilise a rocky point in their season.",
      "So far, Juventus are prepared to pay around £26m (€30m) to sign him in a proposal that would involve an initial loan for £1.7m and then a £24.3m obligation to buy in the summer.",
      "Sky in Italy's Gianluca Di Marzio has reported Palace have rejected an initial offer from Juventus. The Serie A club are willing to offer Mateta a four-year deal too with a significant pay rise.",
      "Palace turned down bids for Mateta from Champions League clubs in the summer and there was also a late enquiry - but no bid - from Tottenham Hotspur before they signed Randal Kolo Muani on loan from Paris Saint-Germain on Deadline Day.",
      "Atalanta, AC Milan and several Premier League clubs were also interested in Mateta in the summer but a move did not happen.",
      "Since Glasner's first Premier League game in charge of Palace in February 2024, only Erling Haaland and Mohamed Salah have scored more league goals than Mateta (35).",
      "At 28, he wants to play for a Champions League club or for a club who have a good chance of playing in the competition next season.",
      "He also wants to play for France in the World Cup after he was called up for the first time in October and he scored his first goal away at Iceland. But he faces tough competition for a place in a highly talented squad.",
      "Palace executive chairman Steve Parish is a notoriously tough negotiator, and he has always been reluctant to let any players leave on the cheap. And Palace want to strengthen their squad this month after selling Marc Guehi to Manchester City.",
      "They want to try and win the Conference League and finish as high as possible in the Premier League, keeping Glasner for the rest of his contract in the process.",
      "Club interested: Aston Villa",
      "Aston Villa have been stepping up their efforts to sign Tammy Abraham after Villa officials and the player's representatives watched him play for Besiktas in Istanbul on Monday night. The club were in Turkey to play Fenerbahce on Thursday night.",
      "Villa want to strengthen their squad after selling Donyell Malen to Roma on January 16 but money remains tight at the club and they are conscious of ensuring they meet their PSR obligations.",
      "Villa's high wage bill relative to their revenue means they have to be careful when it comes to spending in the transfer market. UEFA fined Villa £9.5m in July last year for breaking their financial rules.",
      "It is believed Besiktas now own Abraham's registration after he met the criteria to join them permanently amid an initial loan deal from Roma - and he is believed to keen to return to Villa, whom he spent time on loan at from Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Abraham spent a hugely successful 2018-19 season on loan at Villa from Chelsea. He scored 26 times to help Villa win promotion back to the Premier League via the play-offs.",
      "Other clubs - in the Premier League and in Europe - are also interested in Abraham this month and Villa now have injury problems in midfield, with John McGinn joining Boubakar Kamara on the sidelines.",
      "Villa have already been in for midfielders this month, missing out on signing Conor Gallagher to Tottenham Hotspur. They are also trying to find a solution for Harvey Elliott, whom they do not want to play any further to avoid having to sign him permanently from Liverpool for £35m.",
      "Clubs interested: Leeds, Nottingham Forest, West Ham",
      "Leeds United are the latest of multiple clubs to make enquiries to Wolves for striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "The 25-year-old, who is valued at £40m by the struggling bottom side, is also attracting interest from West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.",
      "Leeds are aware of the competition for Strand Larsen and have to be cautious with PSR in this transfer window. As things stand, they have simply expressed their interest in the player with Wolves.",
      "Departures could help Leeds to make room for incomings, and Jack Harrison has now joined Fiorentina. Joel Piroe could also leave in the next days. However, as things stand Leeds believe he wants to stay and fight for his place and the club will not push him out the door.",
      "Crystal Palace are believed to have made an enquiry too, and that is one to watch considering the growing uncertainty around Mateta's future at the club.",
      "Since their own Strand Larsen enquiry, West Ham have signed two new forwards in Pablo and Taty Castellanos, with Callum Wilson also increasingly likely to stay.",
      "Nottingham Forest are the other club to be keen on Strand Larsen but they appear to be focussing on Lorenzo Lucca on loan from Napoli.",
      "Norway international Strand Larsen was the subject of intense interest from Newcastle in the summer, and since he has scored only three times for struggling Wolves this season, in 13 appearances, his value has depreciate somewhat.",
      "Wolves are weighing up what they can do in the market to make themselves more competitive but also protect the long-term, which may include a period in the Championship.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest",
      "Everton and Nottingham Forest have enquired about Sunderland striker Wilson Isidor.",
      "No concrete approach has been made yet as both clubs are also considering or waiting on other targets, whom are on this list.",
      "The Frenchman also has interest in him from multiple clubs overseas, and he is one to watch with 11 days left of this window.",
      "The 25-year-old's contract is up in 2028 and he has fallen down the striking pecking order at Sunderland behind Brian Brobbey and sometimes Eliezer Mayenda.",
      "Isidor has not been in a Premier League squad since New Year's Day and has not started two games in a row since November.",
      "Isidor has scored only four Premier League goals this season, and none since October.",
      "Clubs interested: Everton, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Napoli, Sevilla",
      "Youssef En Nesyri impressed as Morocco reached the AFCON final and it has ramped up interest in him from a number of clubs across Europe.",
      "The Fenerbahce striker, known to Premier League clubs for some time after his impressive stint at Sevilla in Spain, is firmly on the radar of Nottingham Forest and Everton this month.",
      "There is competition from two Italian giants, however, in Juventus - exploring him as an alternative to Mateta - and Antonio Conte's Napoli, who are preparing to lose Lorenzo Lucca to Forest or elsewhere on loan.",
      "According to Sky in Italy, even former club Sevilla have made an inquiry about getting En Nesyri back to the club.",
      "Aston Villa play against Fenerbahce on Thursday night in the Europa League and although it is not clear how much they like En Nesyri themselves, a match-winning performance for the Turkish club would be hard to ignore if that is what he produces.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Besiktas, Benfica",
      "Nottingham Forest have agreed loan terms with Napoli for Lorenzo Lucca, according to Sky in Italy, but the striker has not given a final decision over his future and discussions continue.",
      "Pisa - his former club - are also interested in Lucca and have offered him a chance to stay in Italy so the situation remains in the balance and down to the player.",
      "Forest are therefore also working on other options, some mentioned above, and also including Evan Ferguson.",
      "Forest have made signing a striker a priority following an injury to Chris Wood and uncertainty over the progress of Arnaud Kalimuendo, who has gone to Germany on loan for his development.",
      "Lucca is a 25-year-old Italy international who is technically on loan at Napoli from Udinese. However, Napoli hold an obligation to buy him and so would execute that obligation before he would be able to move anywhere else.",
      "Therefore, if Forest do indeed loan him, it would be from Napoli and not Udinese.",
      "Club interested: Roma",
      "Roma will begin preparing a proposal for Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee this week, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They have been waiting in the wings to move for the forward while United had Bryan Mbeumo away at AFCON and the change of head coach at Old Trafford needed time to conclude.",
      "However, against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge, Zirkzee was not even in the matchday squad. It was said he had a minor injury.",
      "A strong Roma advance will almost certainly test the resolve of both player and club if it comes.",
      "Clubs interested: Nottingham Forest, Fulham",
      "With Roma aiming to make changes to their forward line, including potentially bringing in Zirkee from United, Evan Ferguson's situation on loan there is in doubt.",
      "Napoli and Forest are keeping an eye on the situation and the decision is down to Roma, with Brighton deputy chair Paul Barber confirming earlier in the window that they do not have the option to recall him.",
      "\"It's very unlikely, I would say (that he returns to Brighton),\" Barber said. \"We don't have that option, so if he were to come back it would be because the club that has him at the moment doesn't need him in the second half of the season.",
      "\"At the moment it seems very unlikely - he's playing well and scoring goals, it's not really one that is in our gift.\"",
      "Fulham have also long looked at Ferguson as a way of strengthening at centre-forward but their priority remains to sign PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi.",
      "If Ferguson's loan is terminated and he arrives back at Brighton, there is expected to be increased interest from other clubs in taking him on loan for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Although Roma are exploring changes, Ferguson has impressed there. He has scored five goals in 21 appearances including two in five games in the Europa League. It has been a positive step in his development so far, playing in Italy.",
      "Callum Wilson (West Ham), Joel Piroe (Leeds), David Datro Fofana (Chelsea/Fatih Karagümrük), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Artem Dovbyk (Roma)"

      "United's first goal against City on Saturday evoked something for those present at Old Trafford. You could not help but feel something.",
      "Instantly my mind went back to iconic goals scored against Arsenal. Whether that was in the Champions League second-leg in 2009 - led by Cristiano Ronaldo, Park-ji Sung and Wayne Rooney - or a year later in the Premier League where Nani and Rooney (again) led their own devastating counter-attacking display against the Gunners.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener was not just a classic counter-attacking goal. If you look at that second goal I just mentioned - it mirrored Rooney's lung-bursting run among five Arsenal players to receive the ball from Nani to score. Amad Diallo and Mbeumo showed the same urgency when Bruno Fernandes found himself in the perfect position to lead the counter.",
      "Context is then required. The weeks of tension and impatience building from the Old Trafford crowd after dour and frustrating performances against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month had led to most thinking: where was their next win going to come from?",
      "The Manchester derby was an impressive victory for Michael Carrick and his backroom staff, but there is also a hesitance to get too carried away. Despite that being the best 90 minute performance in years, this United team have shown they can deliver in one-off games.",
      "But I am already more curious as to how this team will perform in the games after Arsenal when Carrick's side face Fulham, Tottenham and West Ham.",
      "This is where we will find out whether they are in serious contention for a Champions League place.",
      "I said similar in November and December when they had a run of games against 'lower' positioned opposition and they failed to capitalise during that time which eventually led to Ruben Amorim's departure.",
      "This is a second chance.",
      "It was quite clear watching some of United's training session this week and speaking to those around the club as they prepared for Arsenal that there have been some subtle changes.",
      "Carrick addressed the players at the start of the session, as Amorim would, but it was still intriguing to see how hands on Carrick was in his role as head coach as they began their drills. This was the first time we had a glimpse of training with our Sky cameras in attendance.",
      "From the open section we saw, watching Carrick, Jonathan Woodgate and Steve Holland run the session in unison was fascinating.",
      "Holland, in particular, made an impression - pushing and encouraging the players to maintain a high level. It sounds obvious but Holland's experience carried a certain authority that was notable from where we were standing.",
      "One change under Carrick and his backroom staff has been shortening the sessions while increasing the intensity within them. There has been a notable and positive reaction among the first team in response.",
      "Although we were not able to see this in the open part of the session, from what I understand another positive change has been the increase in individual work with different players in the squad.",
      "It was widely understood under Amorim, the team would spend a lot of time on the training ground walking through systems and formations they would set up in.",
      "Despite Amorim saying this time on the training ground would yield more positive results the more this side trained on the pitch, that did not happen. This is not a criticism of the Portuguese coach but whatever the team worked on, it did not lead to the consistency needed for him to succeed.",
      "The shorter but intense sessions coupled with an increased amount of time spent on individual work has led (albeit one game in) to a positive atmosphere being created under Carrick.",
      "But there is also important messaging from Carrick and his staff.",
      "As mentioned before, no one inside or outside Carrington will get carried away with one win against Manchester City because of the false starts under previous coaches.",
      "But as Carrick announced to the media during his first week in charge, he has told his players they should enjoy playing for the club and while not getting carried away, embrace the responsibility and privilege that comes with the shirt.",
      "Time will tell whether these changes will have a short-lived impact on the team or whether they will be the foundations of a successful second-half of the season for United.",
      "What is clear is that this coaching staff have made an impression on this group of players and after such a challenging 14 months under Amorim if they can start enjoying their football again then they may just find themselves in the Champions League next season.",

      "Thursday 22 January 2026 07:17, UK",
      "Manchester United have fallen to their lowest position in the Deloitte Football Money League, with Liverpool the highest-earning English club for the first time.",
      "The Red Devils were once regarded as the blueprint for commercial success in football and have topped the Money League in 10 of its 29 editions, most recently in 2017.",
      "However, United are down in eighth in the 2026 table, in part due to broadcast revenue dropping from €258m [£216.72m] to €206m [£172.9m] because of their absence from the Champions League in 2024-25.",
      "The club are set to generate even less matchday revenue in the current season due to their total absence from European competition, and their failure to go past the first hurdle in either domestic cup means they will play only 20 competitive fixtures at Old Trafford in 2025-26.",
      "\"The clubs with the biggest football club brands and position in the market have an opportunity to broaden their reach and offer more to fans on a matchday, offer more to fans on a non-matchday, and become a more 365-days-a-year touch point,\" said Tim Bridge, the Sports Business Group Leader at Deloitte. \"United are probably only just starting that journey now, because of the reported stadium development.",
      "\"If you went back 10 or 15 years, and you looked at Manchester United's matchday revenue it was the industry leader. If you looked at their ability to generate commercial revenue, it was the benchmark by which everybody then went to market and set their strategy. I don't think that remains the case.",
      "\"The opportunity remains for Manchester United. They are arguably still the biggest global football club brand, and therefore they have the opportunity to maximise that in a way that is only possible for a select few.",
      "\"But to do that requires fit-for-purpose facilities. As the industry evolves, clubs should ask themselves whether there is a need to rethink how they engage with fans and how that relationship works. With reports of the new stadium, it is clear they have started to do some of that, so it's very clear they're thinking in that way. Their timing of making that change is behind Real Madrid and Barcelona, but the opportunity remains.\"",
      "United are the fourth-placed English club in the 2026 Money League behind Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal, with Real Madrid top as they became the first team to record revenue over €1bn - €1.161bn or £975.2m.",
      "Liverpool sit fifth after their return to the Champions League in 2024-25 and a seven per cent increase in commercial revenue from non-matchday events at Anfield.",
      "It is the first time there has not been an English team in the Money League top four, with Real, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain all benefiting from going deep in the newly expanded Champions League and the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the summer.",
      "Deloitte said that the Club World Cup had resulted in a 17 per cent average uplift in broadcast revenues for the 10 Money League clubs who had been involved.",
      "Premier League teams may expect to fare better generally in the 2027 Money League, which will be the first to reflect the new broadcast deal which runs to 2029, but Bridge said the best-performing clubs would continue to be those who match on-field success with diversification off it.",
      "\"The trick to staying [in the top five] is maintaining both of those. It used to be you only had to maintain one of them. Now, in 2026, we're at a point where the highest revenue generating clubs are probably broader than football,\" he said.",
      "Manchester City's sixth place was their lowest since the Covid-19-impacted season of 2019-20.",
      "In all, nine Premier League clubs made it into the top 20 of the Money League, with Tottenham [ninth], Chelsea [10th], Aston Villa [14th], Newcastle [17th] and West Ham [20th].",
      "For a fourth year, the Deloitte Football Money League profiles 15 of the top revenue generating women's clubs globally. In another record-breaking year, these clubs reported average revenues in excess of €10m [£8.4m] for the first time, with cumulative revenues of €158m [£132.72m], marking an increase of 35 per cent on last year's total.",
      "Arsenal Women tops the list this year, dethroning FC Barcelona Femení for the first time, with revenues of €25.6m [£21.5m], an increase of 43 per cent from the previous season. Significant investment into fan data and activation helped garner attendances exceeding 35,000 on five separate occasions across the 2024/25 season.",
      "Chelsea Women ranks in a close second [£21.3m] while generating the highest commercial revenue among the top 15 [£16m]. FC Barcelona Femení [£18.5m] completes the top three after another successful domestic season.",
      "\"While growth has developed significantly in women's football in recent years, the shift from the start up phase to the established phase requires consistent time, investment, and effort to develop the foundations in the right manner,\" said Jennifer Haskel, knowledge and insight lead in the Deloitte Sports Business Group.",
