      "Marcus Rashford has shared a New Year's message without even so much as mentioning Manchester United. The 28-year-old is currently flourishing during his loan spell with Barcelona, netting seven goals and providing 11 assists across 24 outings in all competitions.",
      "It's been an incredibly productive year for Rashford, who earned a recall to the England squad on the back of his impressive form during temporary spells at both Aston Villa and Barcelona. Rashford has managed to capture the best moments of his year in nine photographs on Instagram, predominantly featuring him in a Barcelona shirt.",
      "In his message, he wrote: \"As 2025 comes to a close, I'm grateful for a year of change and self reflection. Stepping into 2026 feeling excited, motivated, and ready to be ambitious both in sport and life. MR14 [red and blue heart emoji].\"",
      "Whilst there's no direct reference to United, there is a Villa photograph that shows the spot-kick he converted against Manchester City, which clearly indicates his pride in that particular moment.",
      "Spain's winter break has meant Rashford and Barcelona have enjoyed an extended rest period - with their most recent match taking place 10 days ago on Sunday, December 21.",
      "Rashford started that 2-0 triumph on the subs bench, but he then entered the action for the closing 28 minutes. Hansi Flick chose to field Raphinha, Fermin Lopez and Lamine Yamal as his attacking three behind the striker, with the same trio getting the nod from the start in the Champions League victory against Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Rashford subsequently provided an assist after coming off the bench in that match. Despite being overlooked on two occasions, Rashford responded to the team selection decisions in exemplary fashion, according to Flick.",
      "He said: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected and the last time I checked with him he replied me; 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions',\" Flick said on Rashford. \"'The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important'.",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I'm so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",
      "It comes as little shock that most Spanish media outlets are suggesting that Flick would be keen for Barcelona to secure Rashford from United on a permanent basis next summer.",
      "The purchase option included in his transfer is understood to be approximately £26million. Despite the relatively modest fee, questions remain over whether Barcelona could actually meet that figure, though, given their widely documented financial struggles.",
      "Certain reports suggest that Barcelona must decide between Rashford and a high-profile striker signing, given the long-term worries over 37-year-old Robert Lewandowski.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson once found himself behind bars following a drunken brawl during a period when he had a falling out with his family and \"went off the rails.\" The Manchester United icon celebrates his 84th birthday on New Year's Eve.",
      "His achievements led United to surpass Liverpool as England's most decorated football club, before his retirement following a final title win in 2013 and the subsequent downturn in the club's fortunes. However, Sir Alex has admitted his career could have taken a very different path following a regrettable episode in the 1960s.",
      "At the time, Fergie was a forward for St Johnstone and confessed to turning to alcohol while struggling with being left out of the first team. He was on a part-time contract, juggling work in a Govan shipyard with evening training sessions in Perth.",
      "In the documentary about his life, 'Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In', he opened up about the incident and his relationship with his father. He recalled: \"I was getting despondent about football because I wasn't a first team player all the time.",
      "\"My career was going down the pan and I went off the rails a bit. I was going out in town and I started going out on Friday nights even, the day before a game.",
      "\"My dad would say, 'You can't go to the dancing if you've got a game tomorrow.' That's when we fell out. It got to a point where he said, 'Go your own way and we'll see what happens,' and then we weren't talking to one another.",
      "\"For two years, between 1961 and 1963, we didn't talk. One night I went out and I got drunk and I ended up in a fight and ended up in jail. I went to court and got fined £3. I was a bit of a black sheep.",
      "\"That period has always been in the back of my head and I have always regretted it. Here's me with the background and upbringing I had, and I surrendered.\"",
      "Ferguson's fortunes changed dramatically when he scored a hat-trick against Rangers, which mended the relationship with his father and marked a pivotal moment in his career.",
      "He added: \"It was the most important game of my life. I wanted to go home and see my dad because I knew he would be proud. I said, 'What do you think, dad?' He said, 'It was alright, okay,' and then he starts, 'That's the boy I had.'",
      "\"We were back pals. That changed my life, it was the biggest break of my life and it was the one that mattered to me. It was the most important game of my life.\"",

      "Comments from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes, made just a few weeks ago about Ruben Amorim, have resurfaced on social media. Some supporters have returned to the comments following the disappointing 1-1 home draw against bottom-side Wolves.",
      "United had taken the lead through Joshua Zirkzee in the first half, but found themselves level just before the half-time break thanks to Ladislav Krejci’s header. That is how the score remained until full-time, with Wolves securing just their third point of the season.",
      "The result means that United were unable to build on the positivity of last week’s 1-0 win over Newcastle. Amorim has been criticised for his in-game substitutions, particularly opting to replace Ayden Heaven with fellow defender Leny Yoro against Wolves, despite the team being in search of a winner.",
      "Speaking on his The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast earlier this month, Scholes didn't hold back on his thoughts, saying: \"I don't think this manager gets this club full stop. I just don't think he's the right man.",
      "\"United is about risk and entertainment more than anything. Having fans on the edge of their seat, ready to go. Wingers who beat people, shots on goal, bits of skills. There’s nothing there. That's from the club.",
      "\"We talked about this, this is a different club. They've got Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, who are probably brilliant at their job and what they do. They're not United, they don't have a clue what it is like to buy a Manchester United player, to bring a Manchester United manager in.",
      "\"If you go to Sporting Lisbon and watch - they play three at the back. Right away, that (should be) a no. United never do that. They can’t do that.",
      "\"It’s been proven over years and years and years and I’m talking even before Sir Alex Ferguson. It was always about, 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2. It’s about entertaining people, but he hasn’t got that in him.\"",
      "Referencing Amorim’s changes, comparing them to legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, Scholes added: \"He [Amorim] brought four defenders on against West Ham.",
      "\"If we went 1-0 up, the manager [Ferguson] always said, 'Two, three, four'. I remember once, we were playing Chelsea and went 1-0 up, and we sat back a little bit because Chelsea were a good team.",
      "\"The manager went absolutely nuts after the game. 'That doesn't happen here. When you score one, you go for two. You go for the throat every single time.' I just don't think he gets it.\"",
      "The comments have now been shared again on social media with many fans agreeing with what the former midfielder said. But United don’t have too long to dwell on the draw.",
      "They are back in action again on Sunday, when they travel to take on rivals Leeds United at Elland Road (12.30pm kick-off). They then travel to take on Burnley at Turf Moor on Wednesday night (8.15pm kick-off).",

      "Napoli are planning to sign Rasmus Hojlund permanently from Manchester United and consider the move a \"formality\" with reports claiming they'll land him for £43million - leaving the Premier League side out of pocket once more.",
      "The Dane was signed in Erik ten Hag's second summer, joining from Atalanta in August 2023 for £64m. His age was flagged as a concern, but a long-term view was taken. But after 14 goals in 62 Premier League outing it appears as if United will cut their losses.",
      "The reported figure means the Manchester outfit will end up taking a £21m hit on a player just three years after landing him. If he does leave, Hojlund would add himself to the list of players who ultimately underwhelmed from the Ten Hag era - of which there are many.",
      "He took months to score his first league goal and his shortcomings in the final third ultimately prompted a rejig in the summer with Hojlund leaving for Italy and more than £200m being spent on Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The transfer dealings from the Ten Hag era continued to paint a bleak picture and have cost United dearly. Antony was the headline signing when the Dutchman first arrived - the club eventually parting with £82m to land him from Ajax.",
      "He scored on debut but that was about as good as things got and the Brazilian headed out on loan to Antony in January, later making his move permanent in the summer. The Spanish side would land his signature for just £21.6m - representing a massive loss financially for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Casemiro was bought in for an initial £60m and came with winning experience and pedigree from Real Madrid. Eyebrows were raised at the fee paid for a player in his 30s, but his initial impact kept that quiet. However in the years since he's been unable to have the same impact and his mammoth wages have made him impossible to move on.",
      "His contract expires in the summer and there is a very realistic possibility he leaves for nothing. Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte, who cost £87.5m between them, are both being linked with moves away and neither will recoup their fee if they do leave.",
      "It means the transfer that took place across the Ten Hag era could well cost the club more than £150m in losses. The frustration for United will be seeing players leave and flourish. Scott McTominay, a homegrown talent, is among them given his success at Napoli.",
      "And now his team-mate Hojlund is doing similarly. The striker scoring nine timed already this season. Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has told Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport: \"We did everything we could to sign him.",
      "\"There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it. There's an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.\"",

      "The Scottish boss, who arrived at United in 1986, brought Beckham to the club five years after taking charge. The midfielder was among the celebrated Class of '92, which included Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who secured the FA Youth Cup triumph in the 1991/92 campaign.",
      "The Leytonstone native then earned his senior debut in September 1992 before cementing his place in United's starting eleven. Beckham clocked up 394 first-team outings for the Red Devils, netting 85 times whilst laying on 121 assists.",
      "His trophy haul included six Premier League crowns, two FA Cup victories and one Champions League triumph. The former England captain clearly holds fond memories of his Old Trafford days.",
      "On Tuesday morning, he marked Ferguson's New Year's Eve birthday milestone with heartfelt social media posts.",
      "His first Instagram story featured a training ground snap alongside Ferguson, captioned: \"Happy birthday boss [red love heart emoji] @manutd.\"",
      "A follow-up post, showing him putting pen to paper on his maiden United deal, read: \"Have the best day boss [red love heart emoji] @manutd.\"",
      "Beckham departed United in the summer of 2003 to join Real Madrid for £32.3million. He went on to feature 159 times for Los Blancos before switching to LA Galaxy, AC Milan and then wrapping up his career at Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "While he tasted success after his United exit, his time under Ferguson at Old Trafford remained his most cherished period, racking up more appearances there than at all his other clubs put together.",
      "In 2021, Beckham reflected on his bond with Ferguson. \"The sense of community and family that Sir Alex ensured we all felt was so important,\" the former United star told premierleague.com.",

      "Much to Smith's surprise, he received a sudden telephone call from the Manchester United boss in early 1987. But the ex-England forward, who recalls watching Coronation Street at his parents’ house when his mum answered the phone, snubbed the offer in favour of George Graham’s Arsenal.",
      "Speaking to ex-Arsenal team-mate David Seaman on the Seaman Says podcast, he revealed: \"I spoke to Alex Ferguson. I was getting a bit of interest. One January evening, I was living with my mum and dad still and we were watching Coronation Street, I’ll always remember it.",
      "\"The phone goes in the hall and my mum picks it up and she says, ‘Alan, it’s Alex Ferguson on the phone for you.’ I thought she misheard the name.",
      "\"Alex had only been at United for about a year and they were struggling. So it’s not like it was ‘the Sir Alex’ calling but he was obviously a big name, he’s the Man United manager.",
      "\"I went into the hall and spoke to him. He said he wanted me to wait until the summer when I would have been a free agent. I said, ‘Mr Ferguson, I’m sorry but I’ve made up my mind, I want to join Arsenal.’ Arsenal wanted to sign me on deadline day, I had already spoken to them in a roundabout way.",
      "\"It was a short conversation, I put the phone down and thought, ‘Have I done the right thing there, saying no to the Manchester United manager?’ But they went four of five years really without winning anything and Alex was close to getting the sack.\"",
      "Smith moved to Arsenal in March 1987 but was sent back to Leicester on loan for the remainder of that campaign. Despite his early concerns about whether he'd made the correct choice, the next few years in north London vindicated his decision.",
      "He left his mark for the Gunners by finding the net in the historic First Division title-clinching match between Arsenal and Liverpool at Anfield in 1989. Graham's men ended an 18-year drought to win the championship in spectacular style, with Michael Thomas scoring the second goal in stoppage time to steal the crown from Liverpool.",
      "Despite a rocky start in Manchester, the failed transfer didn't hamper Sir Alex at United as he clinched his first league title in 1992/93 after winning the FA Cup in 1989/90.

      "United pocketed a £5.2million loan fee and stand to gain an additional £38m should the obligation-to-buy clause be triggered. The 22-year-old has displayed encouraging form under Antonio Conte, netting six goals in 12 league appearances.",
      "During pre-season, Hojlund had been resolute about fighting for his place at United. Yet the Denmark international ultimately completed a deadline day switch to Napoli, linking up once again with former team-mate Scott McTominay.",
      "When questioned about his change of heart, Hojlund explained to Sports Illustrated: \"United made it very quite clear that I wasn't part of their plans for this year, coming into the season.",
      "\"And with no European football, I think Napoli saw an opportunity to go and get me. As soon as I heard of their interest, I made it quite obvious to my camp and the people around me that I only wanted to go there.\"",
      "Hojlund shared that a brief discussion with Napoli manager Conte sealed his decision to join the reigning Serie A champions. While he was eager to guarantee regular playing time and had experience in Italian football, Hojlund acknowledged that the chance to work alongside Conte was another crucial factor.",
      "\"He's an incredible coach, I've only seen him do good things everywhere he's been,\" Hojlund said. \"Obviously, that was a big part of it. When he calls, you just have to say yes.\"",
      "The United loanee has been on fire recently, netting four goals in his last three league matches, matching his Premier League total from the previous season. Despite his struggles at United, Hojlund looks back fondly on his spell at Old Trafford, particularly his debut season when he scored 16 goals.",
      "Hojlund's high-profile move in 2023, potentially worth up to £72m, was met with much fanfare. Although his goal tally didn't quite live up to his hefty price tag, the Napoli striker has no regrets about his decision to join United.",
      "\"There was a lot of attention and a lot of pressure, obviously,\" he admitted. \"I felt it was hard for me not to take that step, I was a United supporter. I think I did well; you could argue that maybe I needed another year or whatever, but I felt it was the right step for me.",
      "\"I feel like I did well, in my first year especially - I became top scorer, I had a good campaign in the Champions League and won a trophy with the guys.",

      "Neville is among those to remark on how loyal the United fanbase are. Even if they do have a global pull, the 76,000 seats at Old Trafford are always sold out. Even when the team have been far from the best.",

      "\"No, I am not going to explain myself,\" he said in the days after. Supporters had also grown frustrated by the change of system, which had clearly not had the desired affect. They had chanted \"4-4-2\" during the defeat to Blackburn - a call for a return to the system that brought previous success.",
      "A founding member of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (Imusa), said that fans had no other way to voice their frustration other than to boo - but that it was no knee jerk reaction to a loss.",
      "\"What happened on Saturday was a build-up of ill feeling that has gone on for a long time,\" he said. \"The supporters have been accustomed to mediocrity for too long and this was the moment when they decided that enough was enough. You can argue whether it was good, bad or indifferent to boo the manager but what other option do supporters have to show their displeasure?\"",
      "He went as far as to suggest Ferguson should've walked away in a blaze of glory following the treble success in 1999. Or in 2002 when he had said he would call it a day.",
      "\"Ever since then there have been serious levels of underachievement,\" was one comment made. Ferguson's eye for a player was also questioned after several arrivals failed to deliver.",
      "The conclusion was: \"Over the last four years some of his signings have been so questionable that you have to wonder whether he has even seen these players before buying them.\"",
      "Ferguson would defend his team in the aftermath of the loss that led to the boos, claiming: \"Form has not been that bad. The loss against Blackburn was a travesty of a result because we missed some good chances. There's no point feeling sorry for yourself, you just have to get on with it and we did.\"",
      "Despite a recovery mission that season, which saw United put the pressure on Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, they would still fall short. Ending the year with the League Cup, which came about thanks to a win over Wigan in Cardiff, was some solace but not the prize anyone at the club wanted.",
      "Ferguson's second wind would come though. 2006 marked the end of the most challenging period for the Scot as the club set about winning a hat-trick of Premier League titles from 2007 - 2009. Sandwiched in between was a Champions League success that was spearheaded by Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo: a team that Ferguson regards as the greatest of his tenure.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund’s permanent move away from Manchester United is a ‘formality’, according to a Napoli chief. The Danish striker joined the Italian giants on a season-long loan deal in the summer and has quickly caught the eye.",
      "The Serie A giants have an option to buy for €50m (£43.6m) come the end of that agreement, albeit that will become an obligation should Napoli qualify for the Champions League at the end of the season. All the signs however point to Hojlund making a permanent move regardless. Napoli director Giovanni Manna has confirmed that both parties consider a switch a done deal already.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna told Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "Asked if a permanent move was already a formality, Manna replied: “As of today, I think so.” Manna’s comments come amid claims in Italy that Napoli are already drawing up the terms of Hojlund’s contract as a permanent player.",
      "It has been suggested that the forward will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause written into his deal in Naples - that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund, 22, has scored seven goals in 19 outings for the club this season.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said recently about Hojlund’s form.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund joined Man United from Atalanta in 2023 and he scored 16 goals across his debut season and followed that up with a further ten in his second season - albeit just four of those strikes came in the Premier League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson has always had faith in Marcus Rashford's ability to shine at Manchester United, despite the striker's well-documented issues with Ruben Amorim. The legendary Fergie, who turns 84 on Wednesday, has long been an admirer of Rashford and doesn't need any convincing of his talent.",
      "The 28-year-old has been showcasing his skills at Barcelona this season following a high-profile falling out with current United manager Amorim. After being loaned out to Aston Villa for the second half of last season, Rashford moved to Spain with the aim of reviving his form.",
      "He has certainly achieved that, netting seven goals and providing 11 assists for Hansi Flick's team. However, the England star's long-term future at Barcelona remains uncertain due to wage disputes.",
      "Spanish publication El Nacional previously reported that Rashford is unwilling to take a pay cut if he makes a permanent move to the LaLiga heavyweights. The forward agreed to a 25% salary reduction when he joined Barca in the summer, which reportedly sees him pocketing £12.1million a year.",
      "However, fellow Spanish outlet Sport has now suggested that a breakthrough has been made, with the talented forward open to discussing a wage decrease to fit within the club's salary cap. The U-turn is likely to disappoint Ferguson, who has always maintained that Rashford possessed the potential to achieve greatness at Old Trafford.",
      "The Telegraph reported that the legendary Scot told his closest sources that he'd envisaged managing the England international at United and stressed the importance of deploying Rashford's talents to maximise the squad's overall performance.",
      "The revered manager was also convinced he could unlock Rashford's optimal role if given the opportunity to work alongside him, acknowledging that many coaches mistakenly deploy the star in unsuitable positions.",
      "Following United's 2023 Carabao Cup triumph, Ferguson was emphatic that the forward delivers his most impressive performances operating off the left rather than centrally as a traditional number nine.",
      "He said: \"Well I don't think he's a striker. He operates from the left hand side which is fantastic. His finishing is always good, keeps his shots down which is really important.",
      "\"He's in a great vein of form and unfortunately for us he's the main source of goals, we could do with an extra one. But he's doing it.\"",
      "Fergie has also hailed Rashford's charitable endeavours after the star collected the Football Writers' Association Tribute award for his campaign against child food poverty. The former United boss heaped praise on Rashford's humanitarian efforts, even pledging up to £2million in matching contributions for the FareShare charity.",
      "Congratulating Rashford at the awards ceremony in 2021, Ferguson said: \"I would like to congratulate Marcus on his achievement and presentation (of the FWA Tribute Award) tonight. I have known him since being a kid of seven years of age, and seen him develop through the ranks of Manchester United into a truly wonderful person.",
      "\"Apart from his football life, what he has achieved in the last few months is quite astonishing, how he has helped the people in need is a truly amazing achievement. I would like to congratulate him on that. He has shown to young people in particular there is a different way of dealing with life.",
      "\"He has shown great humility, he has shown courage to do what he did, so this achievement is well deserved and should be recognised with what he has done. So Marcus, well done on a fantastic achievement.\"",
      "\"I wasn't nervous, I was just excited. That is the feeling that we got anyway being in and around the first-team, maybe passing them in the corridors, just small stuff like that, it builds your excitement and your hunger really.",
      "\"It's like a reminder that is where you want to get to and that's why a lot of players have come through during his [Ferguson] reign as manager and even now.\"",
      "Rashford has openly expressed his desire to have been managed by Ferguson, calling it his ultimate footballing ambition. Speaking about his respect for the legendary boss in 2021, he said: \"For me it was an unbelievable experience and I think for me that is probably the only regret I have ever had in my career, never having the chance to play under Sir Alex.",
      "\"It is something which will probably never going to happen now, but to be on the phone to him and just have 10 or 15 minutes conversation with him was amazing and I am pleased he was aware of the situation and he wanted to help as well, so it was brilliant.\"",
      "Given the mutual admiration between these two United legends, there's little doubt Ferguson could have unlocked Rashford's full potential had he been in charge today. However, that challenge now falls to Amorim, who must weigh up whether to persist with or move on from the homegrown talent should he make his way back to Old Trafford.",

      "Lisandro Martinez was left fuming after Manchester United were held by Wolves at Old Trafford and told his beleaguered team-mates that they \"have to win when they play at home\".",
      "The visitors were winless in their 18 games and had lost all but two of those, leaving them doomed at the bottom of the table. But they were able to take their points tally from two to three by earning a share of the spoils in Manchester, despite going behind in the first-half.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had put the Red Devils in front but Ladislav Krejci silenced the home crowd when he scored to earn Wolves' first point since October. Come full-time the Manchester outfit were booed off after an abject performance.",
      "It halts any momentum the team were gaining and whilst Martinez believes Wolves' position at the bottom is not a fair reflection of their quality, he insists United cannot be letting such games pass them by on their own patch.",
      "He said: \"Really disappointed. We can't come here at home and draw this game. We have to win when we play at home. The opponent has to suffer and we didn't get the three points.",
      "\"Very frustrating. The team gave everything. Just for a few moments, we conceded in the last moment of the first half, that can happen. We can deserve that, it's our responsibility. We played well with the ball in the first half but then we dropped too much, couldn't press their centre backs. They were comfortable with the ball and they started moving round and creating spaces.",
      "\"Wolves don't deserve the place they are, it's a strong team. We respect them. We have to take more risks. The lads are very disappointed, we expect better. We have to take it and accept it and go for the next one.\"",
      "Had Ruben Amorim's side won then they would've leaped into the top four ahead of Liverpool, at least momentarily, but instead they remain in sixth. Gary Neville was critical of the team's set-up from minute one and claimed it was on the head coach to take responsibility.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious 26-year tenure at Manchester United was not without its mistakes, with the legendary Scot acknowledging one of his most significant blunders. Jaap Stam, the towering Dutchman, was considered one of the world's best centre-backs around the turn of the century and was a formidable presence in the Red Devils' defence.",
      "However, after a major falling out with Ferguson, Stam was swiftly transferred to Lazio in Serie A, ending his three-year stint at Old Trafford. Their relationship reached a breaking point at a petrol station, where the Dutch defender's fate was decided.",
      "Stam had crossed a line by including several controversial comments in his 2001 autobiography, 'Head to Head'. Not only did he suggest that Ferguson had \"tapped him up\" when signing from PSV Eindhoven in 1998, he also claimed that the Scot actively encouraged United players to dive during matches.",
      "Stam revealed: \"It's got to the stage where he has even told us, 'Don't try and stay on your feet if you're in the box and get a slight kick.' He wants us to copy other sides we face in European competitions and go down to win a penalty.\"",
      "Unsurprisingly, the revelations didn't sit well with Ferguson, who turns 84 on New Year's Eve. He was so furious about the entire affair that he dropped him from United's starting line-up for a trip to Aston Villa before promptly arranging to sell him to Lazio at the first available chance.",
      "In the days leading up to the transfer, tensions reached boiling point, with Stam walking out of training and making his views clear to his manager. Ferguson then tracked him down at a petrol station before telling him his Old Trafford days were finished.",
      "\"One morning, I told him what I thought and left the training ground on the spot,\" Stam later revealed. \"On the way home I received a phone call in my car from Fergie's secretary.",
      "\"She said that he wanted to speak to me. He came on the phone straightaway. Ferguson said, 'Where are you?' I said, 'Close to my house, at a petrol station.' Ferguson said, 'Wait there!' He jumped in his car and came straight to me.",
      "\"At the petrol station he parked his car and got in with me. He told me that I had to be transferred. Then he said, 'Will you please move to Lazio quickly?' I agreed to do it. Right there and then.",
      "\"One quick conversation in my car at a petrol station in Manchester was enough for me to leave that big club. When I think about it now, and I have never talked about it before, I find it unbelievable I let that, as a player, happen to me.\"",
      "Within a day, Stam had jetted off to Rome to join Lazio. Ferguson then put his trust in the up-and-coming Wes Brown and seasoned pro Laurent Blanc, who was quickly signed as Stam's replacement.",
      "Ferguson later expressed regret over his handling of the Stam situation, admitting he made an error in pushing the defender out of the club. He said in 2013: \"When I think of disappointments, obviously Jaap Stam was always a disappointment to me. I made a bad decision there.\"",
      "Gary Neville admitted last year that it caught him off guard, saying on the Stick to Football podcast: \"Jaap was the biggest one where I felt at the time that it was questionable. And the boss has said it was his biggest mistake, hasn't he, in his book?",
      "\"That was the one where I look at that transfer and think, 'He's the best centre back in the world. No one's beating him. No one's beating Jaap Stam!'\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson earned plenty of praise for his transfer dealings at Manchester United but even the legendary boss got it wrong on occasion. The iconic manager, who turns 84 on Wednesday, once branded midfielder Owen Hargreaves' spell at Old Trafford as \"a disaster\".",
      "The England international joined United from Bayern Munich in 2007. The £17million signing had secured four Bundesliga titles and lifted the Champions League during his spell at the German giants, while Hargreaves had also won plaudits with standout displays at the 2006 World Cup.",
      "A defensive midfielder, he was seen as a potential replacement for Roy Keane and showed early promise. Hargreaves featured 34 times in his first campaign as Ferguson's men captured a Premier League and Champions League double, even scoring his spot-kick in the dramatic penalty shootout triumph over Chelsea.",
      "However, his luck soon turned, with recurring patellar tendinitis keeping him out of action and effectively finishing his career. Hargreaves would manage just five more outings across the following three campaigns, prompting Ferguson to name him among his biggest disappointments.",
      "In his 2013 autobiography, Ferguson wrote: \"We started to put together a bid for him. But I studied his playing record and felt a tinge of doubt.",
      "\"I didn't feel a strong vibe about him. David Gill worked hard on the deal with Bayern. I met Owen's agent at the World Cup final in Berlin. Nice man, a lawyer. I told him we could develop Hargreaves at United.",
      "\"It turned out to be a disaster. Owen had no confidence in himself whatsoever. He didn't show nearly enough determination to overcome his physical difficulties, for my liking.",
      "\"I saw him opt for the easy choice too often in terms of training. He was one of the most disappointing signings of my career.\"",
      "\"I rang him, when I heard,\" Hargreaves said in 2021. \"I was surprised myself. My family were really surprised.",
      "\"I think anyone who's been around me knows that I left home at 15 alone, to go to a country where I couldn't speak the language to play football. I left the comfort of Bayern to play for Man United, because I wanted to represent Man United, to play for Sir Alex and be part of that great team.",
      "\"I never took the easy step. I played for a country I wasn't even born in because I wanted to be the best. I probably never should have been a professional football player, based on my start! But I worked my way and, obviously, didn't finish the way I wanted. A lot of things went into that.\"",
      "He added: \"As much as it was disappointing for him not having me play - because when I was fit, he played me all the time. I told him on the phone, I promised him, it broke me more than it did him. Because that was my career.",
      "\"To this day, I haven't done a day of sport since. I can't because of my knee. If you just forget the football side, my career changed from one day to the next and for a young man chasing a ball around all of his life, it was a pretty significant day. I haven't been able to play sport like that since. To say it went the way I envisioned would be a lie.\"",

      "To Manchester United fans, Sir Alex Ferguson has always been a figure of strength and resilience. Yet the period since his retirement in 2013 has pushed the iconic manager through trials that football never managed to inflict.",
      "The first major turning point came in May 2018, when he was struck by a sudden brain haemorrhage that demanded emergency, life-saving surgery. While in hospital, Sir Alex found himself asking \"how many sunny days I would see again\".",
      "Given the circumstances, his pessimism was understandable. Medical staff believed that his chances of survival upon arrival at Salford Royal Hospital were only 20 per cent.",
      "\"There were five brain haemorrhages that day,\" Ferguson, then aged 79, said in the 2021 documentary 'Sir Alex Ferguson: Never Give In'. \"Three died. Two survived. You know you are lucky.",
      "\"It was a beautiful day, I remember that. I wondered how many sunny days I would ever see again. I found that difficult.\"",
      "Early in his recovery, the 13-time Premier League champion worried that he might permanently lose his memory after a setback that left him unable to speak properly. \"I was trying to force it out but I couldn't get it out,\" he explained. \"One of the doctors came in and I was crying because I felt helpless.\"",
      "Looking back on the moment he collapsed at home, Ferguson confessed that feelings of \"loneliness\" and the fear of death entered his thoughts. \"The moments when you are on your own, there is that fear and loneliness that creeps into your mind,\" he said. \"You don't want to die. That is where I was at. These things did flash through my mind quite a lot.\"",
      "Although Ferguson eventually recovered fully, the years that followed brought significant changes to his personal life. Towards the end of 2023, Sir Alex was devastated by the death of his wife of 57 years, Lady Cathy, whom he often described as the \"bedrock\" of his life.",
      "He has also said she was the only person he never answered back to - a remarkable admission from a man famous for unleashing fearsome 'hairdryer treatments' on underperforming players.",
      "The couple first met in 1964 while working at a typewriter factory and married two years later. Cathy went on to have a crucial influence on Ferguson's career, offering stability and support while also shaping key moments, including persuading him to reverse his decision to retire in 2002.",
      "Following her death, Sir Alex acknowledged that he had \"struggled to leave the house.\" Consumed by grief, he opted to spend time travelling to distract himself, visiting destinations such as Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and Bahrain.",
      "After returning home, he joined a dementia support group and later decided to sell his £3.25million Cheshire home, where he and Cathy had lived since 2010. Sir Alex now resides in the village of Goostrey, near Knutsford, living next door to his son Darren.",
      "Since stepping away from management, Manchester United has remained a constant presence in Ferguson's life. The legendary Scot continues to attend matches regularly, often watching from the directors' box.",
      "However, his paid role as a club ambassador was ended last year as part of wide-ranging cost-cutting measures introduced by owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The INEOS chairman, who bought a 25 per cent stake in his boyhood club in February 2024, has overseen hundreds of redundancies at United.",
      "Ferguson had reportedly been earning £2m annually and while he was described as \"grumpy\" by Ratcliffe when told the position would end, he ultimately responded with dignity. \"I take my hat off to Alex,\" Sir Jim said in March.",
      "\"I sat down with Alex, just the two of us in the room. And I said, 'Look, the club isn't where you may think it is. It is spending more than it's earning and we're going to finish up in some difficulties. Honestly, we can't really afford to continue to pay you £2m a year.'",
      "\"I said, 'I'm going to leave it with you, let you have a think about it.' It was very grown up. Maybe a little bit grumpy at the beginning, but he got it. He came back three days later, after talking to his son and said, 'Fine, I'm going to step away from it. My decision.'\"",
      "He continued: \"I think it reflects really well on Alex because he put the club before himself.\"",
      "For someone whose identity was forged through authority, dominance and constant success, the hardships of recent years have exposed another side of Sir Alex Ferguson - one defined by vulnerability, humility and quiet resolve.",
      "The game once bent to his will, but illness, bereavement and upheaval have required a different resilience altogether. To countless fans, Ferguson will always be the indomitable force on the touchline. But perhaps his greatest victories have come away from the spotlight - in survival, in love and in learning to let go.",

      "Manchester United icon Andy Cole has candidly spoken about his ongoing struggle with kidney issues. The ex-England forward, who was struck down by illness in 2015 and underwent a kidney transplant two years later, joined the Red Devils in 1995 after a stellar 34-goal season for Newcastle.",
      "Cole quickly made his mark at Old Trafford, forming a lethal partnership with Dwight Yorke that powered United to their historic 1999 treble. That year, Cole netted 24 times across all competitions, while Yorke bagged 29.",
      "The 54-year-old hung up his boots in 2008, but post-retirement life has been marred by health troubles. A decade ago, he suffered kidney failure after picking up an unidentified virus during a trip to Vietnam.",
      "His condition deteriorated to such an extent that he required a kidney transplant in 2017. Fortunately, his nephew was a match and the operation was successful. Despite this, Cole continues to grapple with his health issue and has now offered a heartfelt glimpse into how it impacts him.",
      "\"It was just a really mentally testing time,\" said Cole, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"You've been fit the majority of your life and then all of a sudden you find yourself in a situation where you're like, 'How do I actually go about this one?'",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"I think when I first went down, the first thing I was thinking was I'd just attack it exactly like I used to do when I was playing football: 'Just get on with it. Man up.' Then I realised it was going to take a little more than that.",
      "\"I think it has been the most challenging thing I've had to go through. Because everything's self-doubt. You're not sure how things are gonna work out for you.",
      "\"It's all self-doubt with this illness because it's a fatigue illness and you forever question yourself. 'Will I be able to do this? Will I be able to do that?'",
      "\"I had around two years of questioning myself. Then in that time, I felt ill a few more times and I've actually turned around and said to myself, 'Sod it. Get on with it.'",
      "\"I was backed so much by a lot of my former team-mates saying, 'Come on. We know what you're like. We know mentally you're strong.' You've got to realise you can't be stubborn anymore.",
      "\"I mean, what will be will be, you know? Just live your life, enjoy what you've got left. That's the way I try and view things now. Ultimately, with the illness every now and then it's gonna be a struggle. Just gotta ride it out.",
      "ANDY COLE EPISODE ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Watch All Out Football's episode with Andy Cole here.",
      "\"I look at things totally different now. I mean, we've got to enjoy every day for what it is. As I say to everyone now, 'Tomorrow's not a given, so just enjoy today for what is.'",
      "\"If I wake up tomorrow and, as I call it, it's a kidney day, you get on with it. You ride the day out. Tomorrow is a new day. I've got no time for nonsense anymore.\"",

      "There are set to be big changes at Manchester United heading into 2026. Ruben Amorim has been at the helm for over a year now, and his team have put in some solid performances so far this season.",
      "There was a plethora of new arrivals in the summer transfer window, with Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo just some of the players coming through the door.",
      "And it seems there will be even more activity in the January window. Joshua Zirkzee, Kobbie Mainoo, and Casemiro have all been linked with moves away from the club and could secure deals in the coming weeks.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United are keen on bringing back Scott McTominay to Old Trafford. The Napoli midfielder left the club in the summer last year and has been thriving in Italy alongside United player Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The Scotland international helped Antonio Conte's side win the Serie A last season, and he has gone on to become one of the leading midfielders in European football.",
      "Napoli would obviously prefer to keep McTominay, but according to reports, they would be willing to listen to offers in the region of £60m.",
      "Not only has McTominay been a great player for Napoli, but he was also awarded the Serie A Player of the Year award thanks to his contributions in their title-winning season.",
      "With Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and potentially even Bruno Fernandes heading for the exit in 2026, re-acquiring the services of McTominay would be a smart move.",
      "United have confirmed the signing of Lea Schuller from Bayern Munich. She has signed a contract until summer 2029 and will officially join on January 1. She has scored more than 100 goals for the German heavyweights and has bagged 54 goals in 82 international games.",
      "Matt Johnson, Director of Women’s Football at Manchester United, said: \"Lea's goalscoring record is phenomenal, her style of play will give our attack an exciting new dimension. We are delighted to add a player of her pedigree to the group.",
      "\"Lea’s winning mentality and experience will really help our young and ambitious team as we continue to grow together and compete across domestic and European competitions.\"",
      "\"From the first conversations that I had with Marc and the club, the ambitions of everyone here were very clear. I still have so much that I want to achieve in my career, and I know that Manchester United is the perfect club to join.",
      "\"I feel that the team’s style of football will really suit my game, I hope my qualities and experience can help us to achieve our aims both in England and in the Champions League.\"",

      "Senne Lammens' agent has claimed that Manchester United originally planned to retain Andre Onana at Old Trafford to mentor the Belgian shot-stopper. Lammens joined United this summer in an £18.2million deal, with additional clauses, from Belgian Pro League outfit Royal Antwerp.",
      "The goalkeeper penned a five-year deal after breakthrough talks before making the journey to Manchester to complete his switch on deadline day. The 23-year-old is considered amongst Europe's most promising young keepers and has largely made a positive impression under Ruben Amorim thus far.",
      "Although he has managed only two clean sheets, the stopper has provided a reliable figure for United's backline, which has been frequently shuffled due to form and fitness issues this campaign.",
      "Speaking to Belgian outlet HBVL, Lammens' representative Mark Volders has discussed his client's switch to Amorim's squad whilst suggesting the club altered their strategy regarding Onana. The Cameroon international departed United on loan to Turkish Super Lig outfit Trabzonspor shortly after Lammens' arrival in M16.",
      "\"Those critical voices... the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez,\" Volders said.",
      "\"But actually, for a long time, the intention within United was for Onana to stay and for Senne to be given time to adjust.",
      "\"Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Lammens has recently confessed to being \"surprised\" by the camaraderie and unity within United's dressing room since his arrival.",
      "The goalkeeper spoke with Malaysian broadcaster Stadium Astro during an interview at Carrington, where he was quizzed about his closest relationships in the squad. Lammens mentioned two fellow shot-stoppers but revealed he feels connected to the entire group due to their strong bond.",
      "He said: \"I would say maybe Tom Heaton or the fourth goalkeeper Dermot Mee or also, like, the Dutch guys, because it's easier with the language as well. But I think just in general that's what surprised me the most.",
      "\"It's just the togetherness of the group and of the dressing room. Everyone was really nice. So I don't really want to say one or two guys. It's in general with everybody, to be honest.\"",
      "Lammens offered additional personal details when he disclosed that he keeps a journal before and after fixtures. He added: \"I think it started when I started played at Antwerp two years ago.",
      "\"I like to write things down before and after a game just to get my head into the right mindset. Sometimes if things don't go right, or you don't want it in your head, you just write it down to get it off your chest.",
      "\"I came up with it [journaling] a little bit myself, but also got it [the idea] from people talking about it as well, so I thought I would give it a try and it actually helped me a lot, so I still do it.",
      "\"Before a game, I write down a little bit about the opponent, about how they will play and put pressure on me. Also individual things, like key points I have to remember throughout the game.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why Joshua Zirkzee was substituted at half-time in Tuesday night's disappointing Premier League draw against Wolves. The striker had put United ahead with a deflected effort before the visitors levelled in injury time.",
      "Zirkzee came into the starting line-up in place of Mason Mount following the Boxing Day win over Newcastle United. Mount missed the game against Wolves after picking up a \"small\" injury.",
      "After half-time, Zirkzee did not come back out with his teammates and was replaced by academy star Jack Fletcher. United dropped points against the Premier League's bottom team after Patrick Dorgu had a goal disallowed and Benjamin Sesko came close.",
      "\"Point toward injuries, AFCON, but I think every team is in a similar situation. I am not quite sure what happened with him (Zirkzee). If he was injured, fair enough, if he wasn't, it's a bizarre substitution to make.\"",
      "Following another disappointing evening at Old Trafford, Amorim was asked why the Netherlands international was taken off. Surprisingly, the United boss didn't mention any sign of a potential injury.",
      "\"We were running around and trying to recover the ball,\" he explained. \"They overload with a lot of midfielders and we were struggling with that. Sometimes you can attack better with less strikers. We played with three strikers. Cunha, Josh and Ben are three strikers and sometimes it's not the best time to attack well.\"",
      "Zirkzee put the home side in front after a nice turn on the edge of the box and a stroke of luck through a deflection in the 27th minute. However, Wolves levelled shortly before half-time through a Ladislav Krejci header and survived a mini scare when Dorgu's late goal was chalked off to claim a well-earned point.",
      "Amorim laid the blame for the disappointing result on United's lack of creativity, with Wolves comfortable over the course of the match and deserving of a share of the spoils.",
      "Adding on the draw, the United boss said: \"We struggled in the game. We had a lack of creation. We knew it would be a different game compared to Newcastle.",
      "\"We had a different energy during the game, also. If you look at the 90 minutes, we had our chances, but the fluidity that we had, especially offensively, wasn't there because there is a lack of connections in this moment.",
      "\"It's a completely different game [to Newcastle]. We had more men behind the ball and when you do, you have to work harder to get the ball, to get imagination.",
      "\"We lacked that quality today. We didn't play well and when you don't play well with the ball, you struggle without the ball. We need to recover and go to the next one.\"",
      "The result leaves United in sixth place, two points behind Liverpool in fourth, with one more game played and a staggering 15 points away from table toppers Arsenal.",

      "Christmas is a time for miracles - and Wolves almost produced one at Old Trafford. But even though the Premier League's rock-bottom side couldn't break their season's duck with a win - it didn't stop Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim from spitting feathers.",
      "Somehow it felt fitting that United ended 2025 by failing to beat the worst team in the top flight. And on this evidence, there is little to suggest 2026 will be much better for a United side which has become the masters of being predictably unpredictable.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee had fired United ahead, when his deflected shot beat Jose Sa on 27 minutes. But the visitors stunned Old Trafford with a shock equaliser from Ladislav Krejci on the stroke of half time. And it took a sensational double save from Senne Lammens to deny Krejci and then Yerson Mosquera from securing a win for Wolves that would have been as rare as a visit from Santa Clause himself.",
      "United had headed into this clash with a host of leading lights missing, due to a combination of injuries and the African Cup of Nations. But despite Amorim having to field a weakened team, it was difficult to see anything other than a home win.",
      "That's because Wolves were the visitors. A team with just two points to their name this season and rock bottom of the table, 16 points from safety. A side which had lost 25 league games this year, one short of matching the most ever in a calendar year, a record set by Ipswich Town in 1994.",
      "But Wolves were the better team in the first half and didn't deserve to go behind. But Jose Sa was left with no chance when Zirkzee's shot deflected off the stomach of Krejci, to see the Dutchman score his first league goal on this ground in more than 12 months.",
      "Given Wolves' track record, the outcome from here felt inevitable. But the visitors started to threaten and created chances which Tolu Arokodare and Hugo Bueno both missed. Yet the equaliser Wolves deserved came on the stroke of half time, when Krejci arrived at the back post to send a downward header past the outstretched hand of Lammens.",
      "United were booed off - and Amorim looked furious. His mood wasn't helped when Sa somehow clawed out a header towards his own goal from Mosquera. While Jhon Arias saw a powerful effort whistle just wide at the opposite end, as the visitors sensed a famous triumph.",
      "Wolves looked the more likely winners, only for Lammens to ride to United's rescue. To tone down the shade of red Amorim and his flops were left with on their glum-looking faces.",

      "Ruben Amorim said the decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half-time of Manchester United's draw with Wolves was because his side were struggling to gain control of the midfield. Zirkzee scored United's goal via a deflection but the visitors were the better side before the break, despite failing to win a single Premier League game this season.",
      "Zirkzee was replaced at half-time by teenager Jack Fletcher. Amorim confirmed the decision was tactical and he felt it paid off, with his team better able to win possession back in the second half, although they continued to struggle for creativity.",
      "\"We need to do what the game was asking. They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" said Amorim. \"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Despite that, Amorim only turned to academy debutant Bendito Mantato and centre-back Leny Yoro after the break. He ignored the attacking options of Shea Lacey and Chido Obi on the bench despite United desperately needing a goal to earn the victory.",
      "The 40-year-old defended that decision and said the circumstances weren't right to throw too many youngsters on, with eight first-team players missing and his team struggling for fluidity. \"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.

      "There was a smattering of sarcastic cheers from the Stretford End when it was announced that Zirkzee had been replaced by Jack Fletcher for the second half of the game.",
      "Zirkzee was responsible for the opening goal of the match, but he also had a hand in the Wolves' equaliser, which is partly why some United fans were happy to see him brought off.",
      "Amorim hooked Zirkzee in favour of giving Fletcher his third senior appearance. Zirkzee is keen to leave in the January window for the sake of regular starts, and he may be granted his wish.",
      "It was time last year that Zirkzee was booed by his own fans after being hooked in the 33rd minute against Newcastle. The reaction against Wolves wasn't as bad, but the smattering of sarcastic cheers proves that he has failed to convince matchgoing fans since his arrival from Bologna.",
      "Where was the anger?",
      "The reaction - or lack of - from United's players to Krejci's equalising goal was fascinating, as they trudged back to the halfway line without saying a word to each other.",
      "Casemiro scooped the ball out of the net and kicked it away in frustration, but there was no inquest amongst the red shirts to determine how the Premier League's worst side had scored.",
      "The lack of a response was the kind of thing that Roy Keane would slam if he were on punditry duty. Where was the leadership among a group of senior players?",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost certainly would have led an inquest if he had been on the pitch.",
      "The sluggish start",
      "Amorim has regularly spoken about the importance of starting well at Old Trafford because coming out of the traps quickly whips up the crowd and helps to create an intimidating atmosphere.",
      "United's players looked like they had eaten too much turkey and Christmas pudding in the opening exchanges against Wolves, though. Amorim was not happy with the sluggish start and became increasingly frustrated on the touchline, waving his arms in an attempt to encourage quicker play from the back.",
      "The crowd went flat due to the pedestrian pace. \"Is this the Etihad?\" the Wolves fans taunted, which was followed by a rendition of \"You're just a ground full of tourists.\"",
      "It was understandable that Old Trafford was not at its loudest. Wolves rocked up in Manchester with two points, but they looked like the better side, running harder and winning second balls.",
      "The arm around Sesko",
      "Sesko created an opportunity for himself in the first half thanks to some brilliant centre-forward play, shrugging off his marker before fashioning a yard in space in the box and pulling the trigger. The shot was fired inches wide of the post, and Sesko hit the woodwork shortly after that.",
      "The Slovenia international rose highest from a corner, but his header smacked against the post. He looked to the ground, wondering what more he had to do, and Diogo Dalot put his arm around him.",
      "Dalot looked to be telling his teammate to keep going. Sesko heeded that advice and continued to get himself in dangerous areas, but his inexperience was evident again when he sent a simple header wide following a clever lofted ball over the top from Casemiro.",
      "It would be more concerning if Sesko wasn't getting into promising positions to score. Nonetheless, his finishing must sharpen to fire United into the Champions League places this season.",
      "Happy with Heaven",
      "United simply could not get going in the opening 20 minutes against Wolves, so it was not a surprise to see fans celebrate a moment of aggression from Ayden Heaven as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Heaven made an outstanding tackle to dispossess Hwang Hee-chan and pockets of fans around the press box rose to their feet to applaud. And they were standing again just 10 seconds later.",
      "Heaven drove with the ball and found Zirkzee around the box. The Dutchman found the back of the net thanks to a heavy deflection, but it was Heaven that deserved all the credit for the goal.",
      "The crowd's reaction to Heaven's tackle was telling. It was the first time in the game that a United player had shown some fight, and it proved to be a catalyst to break the deadlock.",

      "The MEN reported in September that talks were at an advanced stage with Kayserispor on Turkey's deadline day. Kayserispor pushed hard to sign Mather on a permanent deal. The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward.",
      "United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather has outgrown academy football and is hungry to leave his boyhood club to further his career. He has predominantly played on the left wing during his time in the academy, but his preferred position is the No.10 role. His contract at Old Trafford expires in the summer of 2027.",

      "Manchester United ended 2025 with a whimper as they failed to beat a Wolves side who have now failed to win any of their first 19 Premier League games of the season. United started the game poorly but took the lead with a scrappy goal. Ayden Heaven won possession to start the move but the ball fell kindly for Joshua Zirkzee, whose effort was deflected in off Ladislav Krejci.",
      "Wolves had been the better side before the break and got the equaliser they deserved. This time, Zirkzee inadvertently flicked on a corner to Krejci, whose header beat Senne Lammens. Patrick Dorgu scored late on but the goal was ruled out for offside.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: Couple of excellent saves in either half, the second of which from Krejci was a strong hand and he reacted well to claw the ball from danger. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing radar not as good as it usually is and didn't carry the same authority as he did on Boxing Day. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: His challenge on Hwang Hee-chan led to the first goal and he was solid in the middle of the defence. Boos when replaced by Yoro showed fans are falling for him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Lots of ground to cover in the second half and tested at times, but showed his fitness is improving. Combination with Patrick Dorgu seems to be lacking something. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Didn't contribute much in an attacking sense and Wolves found joy down his wing. One good block late on. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Playing because there's nobody else. Solid enough defensively but a weak point in possession and targeted when he gets on the ball. 5",
      "Casemiro: Not at his best and partnership with Ugarte is lacking the ability to control games. Needs to be reunited with a Kobbie Mainoo or Bruno Fernandes as soon as possible. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Would have been mystified at being moved back to the left. Pushed higher in the second half but struggled to match his Boxing Day heroics. Scored late on but ruled out. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Goal owed a lot to good fortune. It came after more fancy flicks and there were plenty of those, but not enough of the dirty work that Amorim had demanded. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha: Failed to match the impact he has had in recent games on a night when so much should have been going through him. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Needs a goal but another bright display. Fashioned a chance out of nothing and then hit the post with a header. Worked hard. 7",
      "Substitutes",
      "Jack Fletcher: Settled much quicker than on Boxing Day and saw plenty of the ball. Happy to show for it and tried to get United playing. Emerged with credit. 7",
      "Leny Yoro: Boos greeted the change when he came on and it felt a bit pointless. 6",
      "Bendito Mantato: Debut on difficult circumstances on the right and showed confidence to carry the ball forward at times. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Fredricson, Malacia, T. Fletcher, Lacey, Chido",

      "The Stretford End had seen enough with just under 20 minutes of Manchester United's final game of 2025 to go. \"Attack, attack, attack,\" was the cry, urging more from a team treating the visit of a side with a shot at being the worst in Premier League history with all the trepidation of a Champions League knockout tie.",
      "Ruben Amorim's response was to turn to his bench - and bring Leny Yoro on for Ayden Heaven. That teenager Bendito Mantato came on at the same time didn't stop the home fans showing their frustration at another of those changes they have come to associate Amorim with.",
      "One centre-back for another when you're chasing the game, while attacking teenagers Shea Lacey and Chido Obi remained rooted to the bench, is the kind of safety-first move that is gradually eroding the faith many of these supporters have in Amorim. Having moved to a back-four on Boxing Day, the decision to revert to a back three against a team with two points from 18 games left many scratching their heads.",
      "It allowed Wolves to settle into the game. United started quickly on Boxing Day, but approached the start of this game as if they had a belly full of mince pies and chocolates. It's so often the way in a defensive system and it felt as if Amorim hadn't learnt his lesson.",
      "It's only a couple of weeks since Paul Scholes said Amorim didn't get Manchester United. This is the kind of night that makes you think he might just be on to something. They have improved this season, but the football can be slow and uninspiring. Amorim will point to the injuries. His critics will point to the level of opposition.",
      "Even the goal they got owed plenty to a big slice of fortune. It was a year to the day since Joshua Zirkzee was replaced after just 33 minutes of an Old Trafford defeat to Newcastle, with the ironic cheers that greeted his number going up the kind of moment that can kill a player's confidence. The Dutchman has shown character in recovering from that, but not the quality that suggests his stay at this club will last much longer.",
      "This time, he lasted 45 minutes and even managed a goal, but it was the kind of night that showed why Amorim is running out of patience with him. His goal was a scuffed shot that deflected in off Ladislav Krejci, but beyond that it was another casual performance that suggested he is a fish out of water in a team that wants to play with any kind of physicality and tempo.",
      "Amorim was on his case from the start. He had called for an improvement in Zirkzee's approach to duels before kick-off, but none was forthcoming. The 24-year-old used the outside of his foot more than the inside, offering fancy flicks around the corner to try and link with Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, but when it came to getting his hands dirty, he didn't want to know.",
      "The goal actually owed more to a tone-setting challenge from Ayden Heaven, who stole the ball from Hwang Hee-chan and drove forward towards the edge of the box. It was one of the few positive pieces of play United produced in a dire first half.",
      "Sesko fashioned a chance for himself out of nothing and then hit the post with a header from a corner, but Wolves were the better team. Senne Lammens was alert to save from Hugo Bueno, but then saw Krejci's header from a corner inadvertently flicked on by Zirkzee arrow past him.",
      "It was following a similar pattern to the game at Molineux three weeks ago, when Wolves also equalised just before half-time. That came out of nothing, whereas at Old Trafford it was the least they deserved. It also lacked the second-half onslaught United delivered in the Midlands.",
      "If you were being charitable, you could say Wolves had improved since that defeat, but they had still lost every game. They almost dished out some charity of their own when Yerson Mosquera headed past his own goalkeeper, only for Jose Sa to claw the ball on the line.",
      "United needed their own goalkeeper to come to the rescue soon after, Lammens brilliantly saving from Krejci and then getting up to claw the ball away from danger. Diogo Dalot chucked himself in front of a shot from Jhon Arias to deflect it behind for a corner.",
      "For all the huffing and puffing, United's own attacks lacked quality. Too often, they don't get enough men forward. They briefly thought they had won it when Patrick Dorgu slammed in after Sa saved Sesko's shot, but he was marginally offside. It summed up a night of frustration.",
      "The final whistle was greeted by jeers and dropped points against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves in four of their last five games at Old Trafford are going to prove costly. The away end celebrated with chants of \"we've got a point\", and that might be the ultimate humiliation for United.",

      "In an ideal world, Manchester United would have already started their January transfer window with a bang. They were one of several clubs that were keen to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth, and although that ship hasn't yet sailed, it is now looking unlikely.",
      "Semenyo is set to leave Bournemouth this month, and United would have paid his £65million release clause, but as it stands, it looks like Manchester City are set to win the battle for the 25-year-old. United were strongly in the race, however.",
      "Rather than focusing on a signing to strengthen the attack, this approach for Semenyo was for United to bring forward the pursuit of a long-term target because he was going to be on the move now. It is a theme which is set to condition their January window.",
      "If Semenyo does opt for the Etihad, United won't switch attention to plan B. There isn't a desperate desire to improve the attack in this window.",
      "If anything, it is the midfield which needs work, and a deal there could depend on outgoings. United are planning a significant overhaul in the centre of the pitch this year, although they will be happy to wait until the summer window to kickstart that process.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has started the ball rolling on speculation around his own future again, although he won't be going anywhere this month. The same is true of Casemiro, who is out of contract in the summer. Manuel Ugarte is wanted by Galatasaray but is currently back in the team and unlikely to depart.",
      "The biggest story of the month is therefore likely to be Kobbie Mainoo, who wants to leave on loan to play regular football, having failed to start a Premier League game under Amorim this season. Napoli are keen to take the 20-year-old until the end of the season.",
      "Mainoo is due back from a calf injury shortly and his departure wouldn't be considered while Fernandes is out with a hamstring injury and Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Amorim has made it clear he wants the academy graduate to stay and fight for his place and a loan move later in January might depend on whether the change in formation presents him with more opportunities and if Mainoo pushes to go. If he does, United might have to consider a move for a midfielder, although premium targets such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson will likely be out of reach in January.",
      "There could also be an exit for Joshua Zirkzee in January. Roma remain keen on the Dutch forward and are looking to put together a loan move that could include an option to buy. Zirkzee is only likely to be allowed to move once Amad and Mbeumo return from AFCON.",
      "There is also likely to be a January move for Tyrell Malacia, who was part of the bomb squad in the summer but was unable to find a new club. He made his first appearance in 11 months against Newcastle but will be made available this month.",

      "Marcus Rashford has posted a New Year's without making reference to Manchester United. The 28-year-old is currently thriving on loan at Barcelona with seven goals and 11 assists from 24 appearances in all competitions.",
      "It's been a very fruitful year for Rashford having been recalled to the England squad for the form he showed in temporary stints at both Aston Villa and Barcelona.",
      "Rashford has been able to compile the highlights of his year into nine photos on popular social media platform Instagram, mostly of him representing Barcelona but also England and Villa.",
      "In s caption, he said: \"As 2025 comes to a close, I'm grateful for a year of change and self reflection. Stepping into 2026 feeling excited, motivated, and ready to be ambitious both in sport and life. MR14 [red and blue heart emoji].\"",
      "While there is no direct mention of United, his Villa photo is of the penalty he scored against Manchester City, which certainly suggests he's proud of that moment.",
      "The winter break in Spain has resulted in Rashford and Barcelona having an extended period off with their last outing coming 10 days ago on Sunday, December 21. Rashford was named on the subs bench for that 2-0 victory, but he came on for the final 28 minutes.",
      "Hansi Flick opted to start Raphinha, Fermin Lopez and Lamine Yamal as the attacking trio behind the same striker with those three also deployed from the off for the Champions League win over Eintracht Frankfurt. Rashford later grabbed an assist of the subs bench in that game.",
      "Despite having been left out twice, Rashford had the perfect reaction to the team selection call, as revealed by Flick.",
      "He said: \"I try to speak to every player when they are not selected and the last time I checked with him he replied me; 'Boss, you don't have to tell me about your decisions',\" Flick said on Rashford. \"'The most important thing is the team. We have to win the three points. The rest is not that important'.\"",
      "\"This is the perfect mentality. I'm so happy to have him. When he is on the bench, he shows that we have a good and deep squad. What I can say is that he is an absolutely professional player. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he is at his best level.\"",
      "It is perhaps no surprise that most Spanish outlets are reporting that Flick would like Barcelona to sign Rashford from United on a permanent deal next summer.",
      "The buy-option included in his switch is believed to be around £26million. Despite it being so cheap, it remains to be seen whether or not Barcelona could actually afford that - given their well-known financial difficulties.",
      "Some reports have claimed that Barcelona must choose between Rashford and a marquee striker signing with long-term concerns over 37-year-old Robert Lewandowski.",

      "Remarks from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes, made just weeks ago regarding Ruben Amorim, have re-emerged on social media. Fans have revisited these comments following the frustrating 1-1 home stalemate against bottom-placed Wolves, claiming that the former midfielder has been proven right.",
      "United had gone ahead through Joshua Zirkzee in the first half, but were pegged back just before the interval courtesy of Ladislav Krejci's header. The scoreline remained unchanged through to the final whistle, with Wolves claiming only their third point of the campaign.",
      "The outcome means United were unable to capitalise on the momentum from last week's 1-0 victory over Newcastle. Amorim has faced criticism for his tactical decisions and substitutions during matches, particularly his call to swap Ayden Heaven for fellow defender Leny Yoro against Wolves, despite the side chasing a winning goal.",
      "Speaking on his The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast earlier this month, Scholes was forthright in his assessment, stating: \"I don't think this manager gets this club full stop. I just don't think he's the right man.",
      "\"United is about risk and entertainment more than anything. Having fans on the edge of their seat, ready to go. Wingers who beat people, shots on goal, bits of skills. There's nothing there. That's from the club.",
      "\"We talked about this, this is a different club. They've got Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, who are probably brilliant at their job and what they do. They're not United, they don't have a clue what it is like to buy a Manchester United player, to bring a Manchester United manager in.",
      "\"If you go to Sporting Lisbon and watch - they play three at the back. Right away, that (should be) a no. United never do that. They can't do that.",
      "\"It's been proven over years and years and years and I'm talking even before Sir Alex Ferguson. It was always about, 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2. It's about entertaining people, but he hasn't got that in him.\"",
      "Drawing comparisons to legendary boss Sir Alex Ferguson, Scholes added: \"He [Amorim] brought four defenders on against West Ham.",
      "\"If we went 1-0 up, the manager [Ferguson] always said, 'Two, three, four'. I remember once, we were playing Chelsea and went 1-0 up, and we sat back a little bit because Chelsea were a good team.",
      "\"The manager went absolutely nuts after the game. 'That doesn't happen here. When you score one, you go for two. You go for the throat every single time.' I just don't think he gets it.\"",
      "The former midfielder's remarks have since resurfaced on social media, with numerous supporters echoing his sentiments. However, United have little time to reflect on the stalemate against Wolves.",
      "They return to action on Sunday, when they head to Elland Road to face rivals Leeds United at 12.30pm. After, they make the short journey to Turf Moor for a Wednesday night clash against Burnley, with kick-off scheduled for 8.15pm.",

      "Manchester United have a proud history of integrating academy stars into their first-team early, often when rivals would have chosen to be more cautious. The Class of '92 are the poster boys for this movement and have shaped the United philosophy in the years which have followed.",
      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is all but confirmed, according to a top official at the Italian club. The striker was loaned to the Serie A giants for the season and has made an immediate impact.",
      "Napoli have the option to make the move permanent for €50m (£43.6m) at the end of the loan spell, which will become mandatory if they secure a Champions League spot this season. However, all the signs point towards Hojlund making a permanent switch regardless.",
      "Giovanni Manna, Napoli's director, has stated that both the club and Hojlund view the transfer as essentially finalised, reports the Mirror.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna said in an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "The teenager has risen to prominence at United since his move from Premier League rivals Arsenal earlier this year. After making a handful of appearances under Ruben Amorim last term, he has been more heavily involved this season, particularly with mounting injuries in defensive areas.",
      "Heaven has made several appearances across all competitions this term and has featured in the last five league matches. That run includes a standout performance in their recent narrow win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day.",
      "Lineker, an England legend who represented the likes of Leicester City, Barcelona and Everton during his playing days, has offered some insight into the team supporting Heaven’s development at Old Trafford. Lineker is represented by long-standing agent Jon Holmes, who works alongside one of Heaven’s representatives, Andy May.",
      "\"We have the same agent,\" Lineker revealed on this week's The Rest is Football podcast. \"Andy [May] looks after him.",

      "\"It has been a pleasure during the past couple of years to witness Ayden’s development as a footballer and person. This significant move, and the confidence shown in him by his new club, is a testament to his talent, dedication, and ambition.\"",
      "Heaven's recent performance against Newcastle was the latest example of his continued development and impressed the pundits watching on. Former Manchester City star Micah Richards, in particular, feels the youngster has all the tools to become a top defender.",
      "\"He reads the game really well for a young player,\" he chimed in, also speaking on the Rest is Football podcast. \"Physically, he can deal with it and he's strong enough.",
      "\"He's quick enough. But he reads the game well, and for a young player to read the game like that [is fantastic]. I thought it was a really good performance from him, and they needed him because of [the injuries].\"",
      "Heaven will hope to have another opportunity to prove himself when United host Wolves at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening. With Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt still recovering from injury, Ruben Amorim could turn to the youngster once again.",

      "When Patrick Dorgu was racing around the Old Trafford pitch on Boxing Day, demanding the ball at every opportunity and determined to be involved in the game as often as possible, he didn't look like the player Ruben Amorim had been talking about four weeks earlier.",
      "At the end of November, Amorim discussed the pressure on Dorgu to perform and how it can consume young players at Manchester United. He is only 21 and yet to hit 40 appearances for the club, but doubts were beginning to form around the £25million January signing.",
      "\"He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim said back then. \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton.",
      "\"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Sources close to the player insist he hadn't been flustered by Amorim's comments, retaining a sense of confidence that he had what it takes to succeed at United. His self-belief had grown from the January window last year, not just from signing for United, but also from being wanted by several clubs, with Antonio Conte also keen to sign him for eventual Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "He has done extra training since being left out of the team following that defeat to Everton and feels that put him in a position to hit the ground running when his opportunity came around again.",
      "On Boxing Day, Dorgu's tally of 58 touches in the game was second only to Manuel Ugarte's 63 for United and you could visibly sense his confidence growing after his stunning strike had given Amorim's team the lead.",
      "He joked that he didn't know he could do that after the match, and as he watched the ball fall from the sky on the edge of the area, it would have been easy for him to think back to some wayward shots earlier in his United career. He had tried 30 shots without scoring, but it proved to be worth the wait.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Amorim discuss Dorgu after the game and explain how his position as a right winger might have helped to free him up and ease the defensive nerves.",
      "\"Maybe the game today with a lot of transitions is good for his pace and ability to drive the ball,\" said Amorim. \"He played in a position where he can take more risk, that can help him not feel the responsibility.\"",
      "There is plenty of sense in that, although it wasn't a one-off for Dorgu. Returning to the team as a left wing-back against Aston Villa, he produced one of his best displays in that position as well. His reading of the game and tenacity set up Matheus Cunha's goal, and delivered an excellent cross, which created another big chance for the Brazilian.",
      "When he joined from Lecce in January, director of football Jason Wilcox talked up Dorgu's versatility and he can play on either flank, but if Amorim sticks with a 4-3-3 for now, then he could make the right-wing spot his own for a few weeks, with Amad and Bryan Mbeumo away at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Maybe a run of games there, freed up of some responsibility, will help the Dane settle into life a little more at Old Trafford. He deserves credit for fighting back in the last two games after Amorim's November comments and now has the chance to really kickstart his United career.",

      "Manchester United teenage defender Ayden Heaven will not be switching international allegiances from England to Ghana, according to reports this week.",
      "The 19-year-old, formerly of Arsenal, signed for the Red Devils for a nominal fee at the start of the year and made a handful of senior appearances towards the tail end of last season. He made his first-team debut in March in a Europa League clash against Real Sociedad.",
      "This term, Heaven has made several Premier League appearances, five of which have been starts. He recently played the full 90 minutes in a narrow defeat against Aston Villa, and featured against Newcastle on Boxing Day, where he was named the Premier League Player of the Match as Amorim's side kept a rare clean sheet.",
      "So far, the teenager has represented England at various youth levels and earned his first call-up to the Under-20s side in the autumn. He was not selected for the November international break due to injury, but is likely to be included in one of the squads when international football resumes in the spring.",
      "Despite being born in London, Heaven also qualifies to represent Ghana through a grandparent, and his development has understandably been monitored. Under current FIFA rules, players can switch national teams provided they have played no more than three competitive senior games before the age of 21, have not featured in the latter stages of an international tournament and as long as three years have passed since their last senior appearance.",
      "According to the BBC, Heaven will not be switching allegiances to represent Ghana, with the World Cup fast approaching. Although Ghana did not qualify for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, they did book their place at next summer's tournament in the United States and have been drawn in a group with England, Croatia and Panama.",
      "The article notes that Heaven wants to represent England at senior level and force his way into the first-team squad, a feat he will surely achieve so long as he continues on an upward trajectory at United.",
      "Heaven has earned the praise of manager Ruben Amorim this season, with the Portuguese coach highlighting the youngster's attitude and application in training. \"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" he told the media recently.",
      "\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you can feel that he has a good game, slows the thinking and improves during the game.",
      "\"He trained really well. If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",

      "There were plaudits aplenty for Manchester United players on Boxing Day, particularly the defenders who had managed to dig in and preserve a backs-to-the-wall clean sheet that secured a 1-0 win against Newcastle. It was a win that temporarily moved them up to fifth and showed a different side to their game.",
      "United had just 24% possession in the second half and had to do plenty of defending, with Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez excellent. However, throughout the siege, there was a sense of calm that isn't always associated with Ruben Amorim's side, particularly when under pressure.",
      "The return of Martinez might have helped in that regard, but 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has also had an impact, even if his statistics aren't yet making that clear after his £18.2million move from Royal Antwerp. This was just Lammens' second clean sheet in 12 games.",
      "His celebrations at the end showed he was desperate to get the shut-out and although he didn't have to make any outstanding saves, he was secure in goal. There was one excellent claim under a high ball in injury time that relieved the pressure and earned him a pat on the back from teammates.",
      "It was hard to imagine United defending with the poise they did had a different goalkeeper been behind the defence. Andre Onana's form fell apart at Old Trafford and his inconsistency too often spread panic and uncertainty to his teammates. Altay Bayindir has had his moments, but has shown vulnerabilities under the high ball.",
      "Lammens is still learning as a goalkeeper and has just 106 senior appearances to his name, with only 55 of those in Belgium's Pro League before his move to United. It was a signing based on potential, but he has faced little competition in goal, and the improvement when he plays is clearer in the way his teammates have reacted to him than in the saves he has made.",
      "That is something one of United's greatest ever goalkeepers has noticed. Speaking before the Newcastle game, Peter Schmeichel was full of praise for Lammens.",
      "\"He's only 23 years old, he's come in and there's calm at the back four, there's not this chaos where they don't want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man,\" Schmeichel told Viaplay.",
      "\"And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he's not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.",
      "\"I don't think he pays too much attention to the results of the goals he conceded. I think he's living a dream and everyday he comes in and he wants to learn and he wants to improve and I think he's done really well.\"",
      "That calmness was a trait noted by Boxing Day matchwinner Patrick Dorgu. “I think he helped with his calmness,\" he said. “He’s very calm and he’s talking a lot to the defenders and helping everyone on the pitch with his communication.",
      "“He’s just calm and he tries to take responsibility to help us defenders as well. He came in well and he’s doing really well, so he just needs to keep going.”",
      "Lammens is yet to make an error leading to a goal this season and, as Schmeichel touched on, he is happy to go long with his kicking when required. The sound of Old Trafford getting agitated as United try and fail to play out from the back has gone, with their new No.1 better at picking his moments to go short.",
      "It hasn't been a faultless start, and Lammens would have expected to do better with a couple of Bournemouth's goals in the 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this month, but he is still inexperienced for the role he is now fulfilling and there has been plenty more in the positive column in his first few months at the club.",

      "Much has been made of Ruben Amorim's view of the Manchester United academy in recent days. It was only earlier this month when the United boss was having to defend his selection and reasoning behind overlooking the potential of youth.",
      "That changed at Old Trafford on Boxing Day night with United naming five academy graduates on the bench and bringing two of them one. Tyler Fredricson was given the final few minutes as the Reds saw out a 1-0 victory while Jack Fletcher played the second half in place of the injured Mason Mount.",
      "It was a show of faith from Amorim in Fletcher given the manager could have called upon Joshua Zirkzee to fill the second striker role. But the Dutchman was introduced off the bench, just as he had been at Villa Park a few days prior.",
      "United had impressed in the first half with Patrick Dorgu's fine goal the difference at the interval but the Reds were forced to defend deep in the second period to see out the contest, meaning Fletcher didn't get on the ball as much as he would have liked. But after adjusting to the pace of the contest, the 18-year-old didn't look out of place in senior football.",
      "“I think it might take a while to adjust to the tempo and intensity,\" said Fletcher after the game. \"It was really tough out there, heavy on the legs, 45 minutes of defending, I think we did well. Hopefully, I can showcase my talent more.”",
      "His showing will provide food for thought for United, who will be looking to strengthen their midfield given the likely departure of Casemiro at the end of the season. There are question marks over Kobbie Mainoo's long-term future while Manuel Ugarte has struggled to make his mark since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Fletcher, son of former United man Darren, has a bright future ahead of him and is likely to gain more minutes over the coming weeks. He might not be ready for the rough and tumble of top flight football every week just yet, but the experiences over the next few months could mean he's ready sooner rather than later. Amorim has made a point of not promoting academy talents the sake of it, so when one does come into the fray it's all the more impressive.",
      "\"Jack did a very good job,\" said Amorim of Fletcher. \"It's a very important moment for any kid. He's going to hear from his father. He's going to talk a lot about a lot of things, but he needs to calm down and just praise the kid because he's really humble, works really hard, and he deserves this.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford has made a strong impression during his loan spell at Barcelona, with the majority of the Catalan club's supporters keen for him to be signed on a permanent basis next summer, according to a poll conducted by a Spanish media outlet.",
      "Rashford moved to the La Liga heavyweights in the summer, with United and Barca agreeing on a deal that includes an option for the Spanish club to make the move permanent at the end of the season. To retain Rashford beyond May 2026, Barca would need to fork out approximately £26 million.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted seven goals and provided 11 assists in 24 appearances under manager Hansi Flick. His impressive form has put him in the running for an England call-up for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Reports from Spain suggest that Flick is eager to keep Rashford at the club and efforts are underway to secure a deal.",
      "A poll conducted by Mundo Deportivo revealed that 54.6 per cent of Barca fans would support the club in exercising the purchase option in Rashford's loan deal. A small fraction, 6.3 per cent, believe that sporting director Deco should wait until the end of the season before making a decision.",
      "This leaves nearly 40 per cent of fans opposed to the idea of signing Rashford on a permanent basis.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Rashford himself seems to be enjoying life at Camp Nou. The Manchester United academy graduate has spoken about his future aspirations with the club.",
      "In an interview with SPORT, he said: \"I'm adapting very well to the club and the city. From the moment I arrived, I felt that everyone welcomed me very well.",
      "\"For me, the reason I'm here is to help the team win trophies. Last season was fantastic, but in life, everything happens very quickly, things change, and the goal is to repeat the successes. I'm totally focused on this.",

      "\"The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",
      "During his Christmas break whilst La Liga paused for winter, Rashford distributed gifts to youngsters at two Barcelona Foundation centres. The striker revealed: \"I grew up in this type of environment.",
      "\"I always knew from a young age that if I was ever in a position or situation to help [I would], especially people that I see myself in.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "“If they’re getting the Champions League, the average maybe goes to £250k. Is Neves really going to fit in at £200k? I don’t know. It seems unlikely given that he’s probably been on closer to £500k a week in Saudi Arabia.",

      "The manager will point to the league table as evidence that United enter 2026 in better shape than they stumbled into 2025, when Amorim was still getting his feet under the table at Old Trafford. A year later, this is his team, in his image. It was matched and, in some metrics, bettered than a team now mainly concerned with not being the Premier League’s worst ever.",
      "Being held by this Wolves side would inevitably prompt handwringing and teeth grinding on the Stretford End, but Tuesday’s 1-1 draw was not a result in isolation. It is the latest in a pattern of results and performances that Amorim owns to make it very difficult to be optimistic going into the new year.",
      "Everton: two wins in eight when they turned up. West Ham: two wins in 10. Bournemouth: two wins in 11. And Wolves: no wins in 18. All came to Old Trafford in the last six weeks and collectively left with double the number of points taken by the hosts.",
      "A bigger sample: Amorim has won just nine – losing the same number – of his 23 Premier League home games. Under him, United have a 39 per cent win ratio at Old Trafford.",
      "The manager knows that is not an acceptable record. That he doesn’t try to spin it any other way earns him more credit with many United fans than perhaps he is due. It resonates that Amorim is generally as exasperated as the fans over what his team have made them watch.",
      "But there is only so long that such honesty provides a pass before it washes no more. If that hasn’t expired after 12 months in charge, it certainly doesn’t stretch beyond a full calendar year.",
      "The deflating draw with Wolves underlined that United and Amorim appear to have had very different objectives for 2025.",
      "While the club were seeking simply to achieve a level of competency that would represent chronic underachievement in many previous years, Amorim appears to have been on a mission just to show United and the world how clever he is.",
      "Finally, after so long that many had given up hope of it ever happening, Amorim deviated from his precious 3-4-2-1 for the visit of Newcastle on Boxing Day. Lo and behold, putting footballers in a shape more suited to their individual characteristics prompted one of the better performances of the year, at least for 45 minutes.",
      "Amorim deserves some credit for ducking out of a corner his dogmatic tactical approach had backed him in to. He insisted he would never deviate from his formation, even going so far as to warn the Pope not to bother trying to convince him to choose a path of enlightenment.",
      "So insistent was he that he was almost damned either way: for sticking with methods that were not succeeding; or for going back on his word.",
      "United fans were far more willing to forgive the second of those sins than the first. Four at the back sparked an improved performance with limited resources and an all-too-rare home win, despite yet more peculiar in-game changes that bordered on further self-sabotage.",
      "Next up: winless Wolves at home. And while weighing up whether to stick with what worked or return to his old ways, it is hard to shake the suspicion that Amorim looked at the visit of the league’s worst side as an opportunity to show his system can work if we would all just give it a 427th chance.",
      "In many ways, we have brought this on ourselves. It is not just United fans – but it’s especially United fans – who demanded a philosophy, a coach with a clear, discernible style. Everyone insists on recognisable patterns of play, as if predictability isn’t the easiest thing in football to defend against.",
      "Players want it too. Too many now cannot think for themselves having been prescripted every pass and run. Maybe it is easier to play that way, but it certainly a lot less fun for everyone involved.",
      "Well, you wanted a philosophy, you’ve got one. And, as a consequence, one of the many managers who views validation of their principles above all else.",
      "While that remains the case in 2026 and for as long as Amorim won’t change, nor will United.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is at breaking point with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim looking to sell him ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo was our manager of the year at the end of 2024. It’s a slightly different end to 2025 for a man once again at the head of ...",

      "INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe are prepared to take a ‘risk’ financially to get the Red Devils competing for major titles once again and Bellingham ‘would welcome a return to the Premier League if the project is compelling’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Manchester United’s interest is no coincidence. The English club is looking for a player capable of making a difference both on and off the pitch, a generational leader around whom to build their new sporting project. Jude Bellingham, a full England international and one of the most complete midfielders in the world, fits that profile perfectly.",
      "‘The Old Trafford board believes the time has come to take financial risks to return to the European elite. The figure being discussed reflects this ambition: €150 million, which would not only break internal records but also send a clear message to the rest of the continent. Bellingham would be the central figure around which to reorganize the team, both in terms of its footballing style and its image.’",
      "Former Manchester City star Shaun Wright-Phillips thinks the scrutiny from the media on England players could stop Bellingham returning to play in the Premier League.",
      "Wright-Phillips told BestBettingSites: “If I was Jude Bellingham, I think it could put me off from playing in the Premier League, definitely. In England we seem to target a player ahead of a big tournament, like they’re dying to break one of them down.",
      "“I’ve just never understood why. You want your players going into a tournament full of confidence. Arrogant, almost. You want them knowing and thinking they can win. The press should big them up, help them, not tear them down like this. The press causes problems and puts doubts in their head, and changes the way they think.",
      "“I think if you change a player’s personality, you change how they play. That’s not always good. Far from it. I think the players need to just concentrate on what they’re doing. So if I was Jude, why would I come back when I can stay at Real Madrid and enjoy life at the same time, without bad press that comes for no reason.",
      "“I think he’s the go-to man for England, and I sometimes do not understand why he is in the crosshairs. He’s not perfect, but he’s performing well for club and country. It’s not like he has some huge arrogant attitude, or plays badly. They should leave him be and let him prepare mentally.”",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points.

West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",

      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just further highlighted the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens. We do now have the novelty for a bit of that stuff being stuff that happens without Bruno Fernandes. But still: just stuff. Like beating Newcastle and then drawing at home against the worst Premier League team of all time.",
      "The fact that United’s response to the Newcastle win was to talk about Champions League pushes and even in some outlandish cases title charges just shows how little the ‘United are just stuff that happens’ reality is being understood and accepted. Even yer man waiting for his haircut was getting cocky after beating Newcastle with Wolves up next.",
      "We need you all to grasp this: what United have done in their last game or even last handful of games has absolutely no bearing on what will happen next. They have not turned a corner. The truth is they turn so many corners that they just always end up back where they started.",
      "What does all this mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s rather cleverly survived through such a lowering of standards that he’s probably fine. They’re definitely a bit less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And narrow defeats at Arsenal and Liverpool at least showed a bit of something before hilariously running off with a point from Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "Then even a welcome victory has put Maresca under even more pressure after he decided to be very, very weird about everything immediately afterwards.",
      "And while Chelsea aren’t the first team to see apparent control of a game against Villa turn into a painful, perplexing defeat, they are perhaps the most profound example. And it was another that raised serious questions about the players and manager.",
      "A key element to this season is which team you land for the near back-to-back repeat rounds. Villa have turned having to play Arsenal twice in quick succession into a burgeoning conspiracy theory, for instance. Chelsea, on the other hand, got a huge boost: two games against Bournemouth while Bournemouth are in one of their relegation-form lows rather than Champions League-form highs. Failing to win either of those games is p*ss poor.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "And a deeply unconvincing win over Crystal Palace even more so – a result that in deeply Spurs fashion lifted them back to the very top of the away table – but the identity of the victim definitely helps Frank too. It can’t be doing him any harm that both Glasner and Andoni Iraola – the two most obvious in-league targets if Spurs did want to change course – are both having a tricky spell themselves.",

      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact, get them relegated. They are still in the bottom three and the increasing signs of life at Nottingham Forest, Leeds and others have to be a growing concern.",
      "Are there three worse teams than West Ham in the Premier League this season? It’s an extremely fair question with an increasingly troubling conclusion for those of a Hammers persuasion.",

      "It will provide the Red Devils with a healthy cash boost, while there’s also the possibility of further financial gains with Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford also set to leave, and Mason Greenwood having a big sell-on clause.",

      "“United will have €50m from Hojlund’s deal (€44m obligation + €6m loan fee), and that is very important for news. It’s also the reason why they want to invest in 2026 because they will have fresh money from Hojlund’s deal.",

      "“We know that Dorgu is a left wing-back and we’ve seen him play there a number of times now and he does okay there, he’s willing, and so does Dalot at right wing-back. I think they’re both willing. I’ve played that position and I think I was a pretty decent right-back… it’s a bloody tough position to play right wing-back or left wing-back, it just is.",

      "“Sesko plays up top, Cunha plays to the left, Dorgu plays to the right, Zirkzee plays in that little hold off Sesko. You’ve got [Manuel] Ugarte and Casemiro in midfield, you’ve got Luke Shaw at left-back, Ayden Heaven and Martinez at centre-back and you’ve got Dalot at right-back. It’s not not an amazing team but it’s really obvious that that’s the team that should be picked, in the system that we should be playing.",
      "“It should have been picked and it was so obvious. It’s Zirzkee’s best position, dropping in, Sesko’s got someone close to him which means he’s not playing up front on his own, Cunha’s on the left and can drift in and that’s fine, you’ve got Shaw who can go round him and he’s really good to play with on that side.",
      "“You’ve then got Dalot coming from behind on the other side but you’ve got Dorgu that can cut in which means Dalot go round.",
      "“The big question marks you would have in that system would be Casemiro and Ugarte, and Heaven and Martinez. However, I thought Ugarte and Casemiro did really well against Newcastle, I thought Ugarte and had his best game for the club, and I thought Heaven and Martinez did brilliantly against Newcastle.",
      "“So I thought those four would just be certain to start there. I always want to say that it’s not just the manager, not just the players as there’s a culmination of everything when you get a bad performance.",

      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "City are said to be closing in on the signing of Semenyo having shown the most determination to trigger the winger’s release clause in his Bournemouth contract.",
      "As ever, one transfer leads to another. And a few more besides.",
      "Here we assess how Semenyo joining City could prompt major moves for five other players. Starting with the first trigger…",
      "Semenyo will be the first domino to fall in January, with Manchester City seemingly far down a road they rarely, if ever, lose their way.",
      "City want Semenyo signed sharpish, not just because the terms of the winger’s buy-out clause in his Bournemouth contract dictate so, but also to keep the other vultures at bay.",
      "Until Semenyo has a blue scarf above his head while revealing a soft spot for Oasis, Curly Watts and very tall floodlights, there remains the feeling Liverpool might attempt to throw an expensive spanner in the works.",
      "But we just don’t see City losing out here. And not only because it would screw the whole premise on which this feature is built.",
      "",
      "City already have a surplus of players, with Savinho and/or Oscar Bobb set to be the big losers if they snare Semenyo.",
      "Weirdly, the Brazilian has had the same number of Premier League minutes (467) as Bobb but neither winger is really doing the business in Pep’s mind. Savinho has two league assists to Bobb’s one. Neither has scored a Premier League goal to take any burden off Erling Haaland’s shoulders. Good job, then, that he’s just a ridiculous goalscorer.",
      "Still, with domestic and European competition fierce in what could be the manager’s final half-season at City, Guardiola is clearly keen to upgrade on the right flank, with Savinho the most sellable asset. Especially while Tottenham retain a long-standing interest in the 21-year-old.",
      "Spurs, apparently, are keen to gauge Savinho’s level of interest before they proceed any further only to be covered in custard again. The winger will be feeling the chill at City and Spurs could offer a more defined role than the cameos on either flank he has been restricted to by Guardiola.",
      "MORE: Man City signing Semenyo will give Guardiola a quarter of the 20 biggest January signings ever",
      "",
      "Even before they have signed Savinho, Spurs already seem to be making room by off-loading their Europa League final goalscorer.",
      "Johnson is being fought over by Palace and Bournemouth, with other clubs also said to be keen on the Wales attacker.",
      "Bournemouth seemed to be in a strong position given their obvious need for a Semenyo replacement and the £65million they will have burning a hole in their pocket. Johnson would cost around half that amount, but Palace have reportedly nipped in ahead of the Cherries.",
      "Ornstein says the Eagles have agreed a deal with Spurs worth in the region of £35million, but Johnson is still mulling over his options. So Bournemouth retain hope of landing the 24-year-old, even if Palace are the frontrunners.",
      "",
      "Be it Johnson or anyone else, someone has to replace Semenyo at Bournemouth.",
      "The Cherries’ have slid at breakneck speed into a relegation battle few foresaw just a few weeks ago when Semenyo was on fire while Andoni Iraola’s lurked in the European spots.",
      "But seven games without a goal or assist from Semenyo saw Bournemouth take just five points from 21, highlighting the importance of finding a ready-made replacement for the Ghanaian, especially if they are to spend the second half of the season looking over their shoulder.",
      "The thing is, Bournemouth don’t buy oven-ready. That’s not their model. Almost certainly, they will cast their net into Europe or, as reports suggest is more likely, dip their toe back into the Championship talent pool.",
      "There, where they discovered Semenyo, they will find Fatawu, who has been catching eyes at Leicester from other Premier League clubs beyond the south coast. Sunderland and Everton have both been credited with an interest in the 21-year-old but Bournemouth’s means and haste makes them heavy favourites for Semenyo’s compatriot.",
      "",
      "Semenyo’s switch to City will leave almost the rest of the Big Six disappointed. For some, sure, it was a good opportunity to sign a top-class player for a relatively good price. But missing out allows them to concentrate on the priorities they should be focused on in January. We’re looking at you, Manchester United, and that gaping hole in your midfield.",
      "For Liverpool, though, there remains room in their squad for a Semenyo-like signing. Mo Salah is away at AFCON and Alexander Isak is out until perhaps the spring.",
      "Neither of those circumstances should prompt the Reds to splurge on another forward to fill a short-term void. But Salah’s absence is likely to be a more permanent arrangement, if not from this window, then most likely the summer.",
      "Other issues in Arne Slot’s squad mean it would not be a bad idea to get a jump on sourcing Salah’s replacement. Perhaps Yan Diomande at RB Leipzig? Liverpool certainly have an in with the teenager’s club, and a half-season head-start on the settling process could be useful.",
      "Diomande, though, remains raw and perhaps more expensive than Rodrygo, a player Liverpool have long admired, along with Manchester City. You would think, however, that Semenyo’s signing ends City’s interest in the Brazilian.",
      "Rodrygo joining Liverpool is undoubtedly the trickiest link in this particular domino chain. The Reds will have you believe they are not planning anything quite so grand in January, and the centre of their defence remains a bigger issue than uncertainty in their attack. This one remains speculative but Liverpool are full of surprises.",
      "",
      "Semenyo is certainly a boon for City midway through a title fight which is looking likely to be a humdinger. Will Arsenal respond?",
      "We think so. And, more to the point, Mikel Arteta seems to think so too: “We’re Arsenal and we have to be looking at it… we have to be actively looking.”",
      "Arsenal are entering January in a position of authority because they bought big in the summer. Liverpool spent more but the Gunners’ net spend was greater than anyone.",
      "Having built the strongest squad in the Premier League, it relieves the pressure around the January window somewhat. But despite their depth, Arteta’s resources are still being stretched. Without some swift and considerable relief on the fitness front, Arsenal will go back into the market.",
      "To sign whom? Honestly, we don’t know. We doubt Arsenal know at this point. Quite likely, they will react to the circumstances they encounter around the middle of the month. Which, in their position, is a sound approach.",
      "And the identity almost doesn’t matter in regards to countering City’s swoop for Semenyo. Arteta and Andrea Berta will be desperate to avoid a scenario in the summer where they have fallen short in a title race once more having sat on their hands when they had the opportunity to bolster their ranks and morale mid-season.",
      "According to reports, ‘three major reasons’ have prevented Manchester City-bound Antoine Semenyo from joining Liverpool in next month’s transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim showed once more that his priority is proving his methods work, which will always be incompatible with Manchester United’s ambitions…",
      "Arsenal are the Premier League 2025 Calendar Year champions! But their triumph comes with a whopping, great big asterisk…",
      "Leandro Trossard has one Liverpool fan thinking wistfully of Diogo Jota, while there is plenty of chatter about the latest episode of Emiliano Martinez.",
      "There’s only one winner in the Premier League managers of 2025 battle, and it’s not the winner of the actual or the calendar year title.",

      "Ruben Amorim is really asking for trouble at Manchester United, with his side reaching a new low against Wolves on an exposing night.",
      "There is far more optimism surrounding Manchester United this season than in 2024/25, which is largely due to a notable upturn in results.",
      "Yes, there have also been reasons for optimism with Man Utd‘s transfer business, as it’s difficult to deem their most recent window anything other than an overwhelming success regarding how they dealt with incomings and outgoings.",
      "This, plus head coach Ruben Amorim finally leaving his ego at the door to show a willingness to adapt (for a little bit), has contributed to Man Utd’s growth this season as they have become a more effective unit.",
      "Still, the Red Devils remain miles from their end goal of being a squad capable of consistently challenging for major trophies, as evidenced by most of their performances this term.",
      "The changes in personnel and tactics have led to more points, but these factors have papered over the cracks as performances have been poor more often than good.",
      "This month alone, Man Utd have won two of their six Premier League games. Of these victories, one came via too many nervy moments with a pretty full-strength XI against Wolves, while the other was a smash-and-grab 1-0 victory against Newcastle United.",
      "So, despite United starting Tuesday night on the brink of the Champions League places, there has been enough evidence to suggest that they are in a false league position, and this was laid bare in the second of this month’s meetings against Wolves.",
      "Man Utd are impacted more than most by AFCON absences, while injuries have also taken their toll, but they still had more than enough talent in their squad to beat a side that headed into Tuesday’s match with only two points from their opening 18 Premier League games.",
      "Therefore, the Red Devils’ 1-1 draw is incredibly alarming. The result and Amorim reverting to his preferred 3-4-3 system, which he himself admitted is not working, is bad enough, but it is made worse when you consider that they went punch-for-punch with Wolves in an evenly matched game, which ended with the worst team in the Premier League having more xG.",
      "United’s overreliance on Matheus Cunha as their sole attacking threat without Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo was clear, with goalscorer Joshua Zirkzee’s breakthrough for his side’s only goal coming via a huge deflection to wrong foot Jose Sa.",
      "This came against the run of play, and Wolves were rewarded for their positive work with an equaliser before the break, with Ladislav Krejci’s header beating Senne Lammens following Zirkzee’s poor attempt at a clearing header.",
      "The second half was similarly back-and-forth as two poor Premier League sides could not be separated, with the full-time whistle and certain baffling substitutions met with boos from the justifiably frustrated home crowd.",
      "Amorim revealed before tonight’s game that he is “not going to ask for more signings” in January to “avoid mistakes”, indicating that he is willing to “suffer now” if it means they will be “two steps ahead in the summer”.",
      "But with Amorim’s side continuing to take one step forward and two back, their attack still blunt without the class of a few individuals and the head coach contributing to another nothing performance after finding a roundabout way to revert to his failing system with square pegs in round holes, he is asking for trouble and may not see out the next phase of “suffering” as goodwill runs thin.",

      "The agent of Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens believes the club were “right” to get rid of Andre Onana, a decision he says they made late in summer.",
      "United suffered through Onana last season, with the former Inter Milan goalkeeper making countless mistakes. They benched him for Altay Bayindir early this season, and Onana’s only United appearance this term came in the League Cup against Grimsby.",
      "He conceded two goals and then 12 penalties as the Red Devils were embarrassingly dumped out of the cup, and that might have been Onana’s last appearance for the club, as he was quickly loaned out to Trabzonspor, with Lammens being signed from Royal Antwerp.",
      "The Belgian’s agent, Mark Volders, has revealed the decision to let Onana go came late in the summer, but has now been vindicated.",
      "“Those critical voices… the big problem was that they expected a very well-known name, like [Gianluigi] Donnarumma or [Emiliano] Martínez,” he told HBVL.",

      "“Ultimately, they changed their tune right at the very end, Onana left, and fully embraced Senne. But in hindsight, you can only say that United was right about that.”",
      "Lammens has looked a far more composed presence in the United net, not making the mistakes that Onana did.",

      "Onana is not having the best spell away from the club, either, as in 13 games at Trabzonspor, he’s conceded 19 goals and has only kept a clean sheet on three occasions.",
      "The situation of Onana further vindicates United’s decision to part company with him and focus their attention on the future with Lammens.",

      "He recently said: “He’s only 23 years old, he’s come in and there’s calm at the back four, there’s not this chaos where they don’t want to pass him the ball back to him. They trust him. He seems a very, very confident young man.",
      "“And also, one more thing I like about him is he is so quick in turning the game. So when he gets the ball, he’s not afraid of kicking the ball up the other end or throwing the ball up. Starting a counter-attack very quickly.”",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand has insisted that summer signing Senne Lammens will be the Red Devils’ goalkeeper “for the next ten years”.",

      "The £44m signing has faced stinging criticism at Manchester United and has now been told his Old Trafford ‘career is over’.",
      "We are sick to the back teeth of Premier League footballers being given underserved dues and so we’ve exposed the most overrated stars of every club.",
      "Manchester United icon Sir Alex Ferguson has praised one “outstanding” summer signing and he thinks there are “good signs” under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Man Utd exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed."

      "Antoine Semenyo could break into the top five most expensive January transfer window signings ever, but would still be a mile behind some Liverpool genius.",
      "The Bournemouth forward should move for £65m in January, and the club expected to sign him already feature regularly in this list of the 20 biggest January deals of all time.",
      "",
      "Nine years in Portugal was enough for Brazilian forward and one-cap international Galeno, who wished not to examine the mouth of Al Ahli’s gift horse when it came galloping along in January 2025.",
      "A respectable nine goals, seven assists and two trophies since suggest he was right not to hesitate.",
      "",
      "Considering the Leipzig recruitment model, the idea was likely always to move record signing Simons on eventually at great profit. They likely didn’t expect that to happen within seven months.",
      "Despite the Dutchman’s best efforts, Leipzig failed to qualify for the Champions League in the season they made Simons’ loan permanent. As a result, he informed them of his desire to leave and the poor thing ended up at Spurs of all places.",
      "",
      "Quite comfortably the closest any player has come to replicating what Rodri does for Manchester City, it required a half-season of acclimatisation for Gonzalez to take on board what Pep Guardiola wanted in the middle.",
      "Since then he has become a vital cog in an improving machine. Gonzalez has missed a single game for Manchester City in 2025/26 – and it was one of the few they have lost.",
      "",
      "The transfer which so infuriated Daniel Levy, the supposed master negotiator seething at another club for negotiating. Diaz was a fine addition to further regenerate the Liverpool attack.",
      "They even made a massive profit on the 28-year-old when Bayern Munich started sniffing around. But was the sale of Diaz a catalyst for this rough season?",
      "",
      "It still feels bizarre that Torres played eight more Premier League games for Chelsea than he did Liverpool. The goal haul despite that – 20 at Chelsea and 65 at Liverpool – points to a career trajectory that suffered a sharp fall upon his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "And yet his four years with the Blues yielded a Champions League and Europa League trophy each, with no Anfield trinkets whatsoever.",
      "",
      "Back before Barcelona used economic levers to sign players with money they absolutely didn’t have, the Blaugrana fed their transfer addiction through old-fashioned means like overdrafts and bank loans. We’ve all been there.",
      "They could have plucked Torres from Valencia for £20m or so about 18 months beforehand but shut up that’s why.",
      "",
      "The most transformative signing at United since Robin van Persie. Just a shame the club are dragging him down with them.",
      "",
      "A miserable end should not obscure a mutually beneficial and temporarily happy union. Only eight players who played in the Premier League era have scored more goals for Arsenal than Aubameyang – and of those players, only Ian Wright and Thierry Henry scored more goals per game. If only he was more punctual and non-negotiable.",
      "",
      "One of football’s greatest mysteries is how Chelsea managed to sell a 29-year-old Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid for £57m despite the striker being very publicly surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge, as painstakingly proven by Antonio Conte’s text message dumping him straight after they won the title together in summer 2017.",
      "Costa had not played professional football for seven months by the time he returned to the Spanish capital; his La Liga record during that second spell was 61 appearances, 12 goals and 17 yellow cards, as well as an eight-game suspension he received for abusing a referee.",
      "",
      "Perhaps swayed by Liverpool breaking the world record for biggest transfer fee ever spent on a defender earlier that same month, Manchester City settled for Laporte.",
      "It wasn’t all a smooth ride but five Premier League titles in six years tells quite the compelling story of a player for whom City recouped £23.6million from Saudi in 2023.",
      "",
      "It did not going to plan for Pulisic, who might well suggest that playing for and being coached by three different managers in nearly four years at a time of immense upheaval has not helped. Frank Lampard, Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter all struggled to harness the American’s talents.",
      "And Maurizio Sarri was managing the Blues when the deal was put together. Still, he’s fairing rather better in Milan now.",
      "",
      "A rare case of a January signing immediately thriving in his first half-season before suffering from some delayed growing pains.",
      "Marmoush had an argument for being Manchester City’s best player in 2024/25, contributing eight goals and three assists to a struggling team finding their feet again.",
      "But with Erling Haaland firing and Guardiola figuring things out, Marmoush has found solace largely on the bench as the anniversary of his arrival looms.",
      "",
      "A decent 2024/25 for Kvaratskhelia, all things considered: 13 goals and 11 assists in 51 appearances for Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as winner’s medals in the Champions League, Ligue Un, Serie A and Coupe de France.",
      "PSG capitalised on Kvaratskhelia laughably low wage in Naples and neither club nor player have looked back since.",
      "",
      "Receiving £57m for an unwanted Costa was a quite ludicrous magic trick from Chelsea, but even they would be hard pushed to outdo the £60m they raked in for Oscar, practically a reserve, in 2017.",
      "Jamie Carragher described it as “embarrassing” for the Brazilian, but he can probably live with the shame. Or wipe his tears away using crisp £50 notes.",
      "",
      "Oh boy. You will have read a lot about this being an £89m transfer but the truth is that Chelsea would only have paid £89m if everything went swimmingly. And it has not.",
      "After we were told the Ukrainian winger only wanted to join Arsenal, he signed an eight-and-a-half-year contract with Chelsea. Almost three years on, Mudryk has flopped hard and is currently on the sidelines after being charged with a doping offence.",
      "",
      "Those few weeks when Duran was legitimately probably the single greatest forward ever to walk the Earth were glorious.",
      "Aston Villa and Unai Emery tried to resist his brilliance but could only hold out for so long before indulging on the back of his 11 Premier and Champions League goals in 866 minutes in the first half of the 2024/25 season.",
      "They equally could hardly avoid cashing in when the Saudi coin arrived. And considering Duran can now be found on loan at Fenerbahce less than a year later, it must be categorised as another decisive Villa win.",
      "",
      "The football world scoffed along with Vlahovic at the Sophie’s Choice he was presented in January 2022. After breaking numerous records with Fiorentina, the young striker could have taken his pick of interested clubs.",
      "Arsenal were predictably – and justifiably at the time – rejected in favour of a move to Juventus. What could have been. Arsenal might have been spared their biggest mistake of 2025.",
      "",
      "This was the most expensive January deal ever when it went through on the first day of 2018 and the size of the fee took everyone by surprise. But it turns out that it was basically a bargain for the lynchpin of one of the most formidable teams in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "A deadline-busting deal that was on and off for much of January and only at the very last definitively on. Chelsea ended up going over and above Fernandez’s 120million euro release clause in exchange for a payment structure that suited their needs. Those needs primarily being ‘spread the cost as much as possible across the massive eight-and-a-half-year contracts we give out now’.",
      "Has he been worth it? Meh. Probably eventually.",
      "",
      "Liverpool were merely delaying the inevitable when they resisted Barca’s three offers in summer 2017. The Spanish side had to wait half a season and chuck another £20million at the Reds but finally they got their man and Coutinho got his move.",
      "Not that either he or the buying club will look back on the deal fondly. Liverpool, though, haven’t stopped laughing about one of the best pieces of transfer business ever.",
      "Ruben Amorim showed once more that his priority is proving his methods work, which will always be incompatible with Manchester United’s ambitions…",

      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "There’s only one winner in the Premier League managers of 2025 battle, and it’s not the winner of the actual or the calendar year title.",
      "Ruben Amorim is really asking for trouble at Manchester United, with his side reaching a new low against Wolves on an exposing night…"

      "With Fernandes now injured, Amorim has altered the United formation to 4-2-3-1, with Ugarte partnering Casemiro, and Mason Mount playing in the No.10 role.",
      "But Ugarte has started just four league games this term, largely when one of Casemiro or Fernandes has been unavailable.",

      "Pazzini told Sportsmediaset: “At the moment, Hojlund, under [Antonio] Conte, is the strongest striker in Serie A alongside Lautaro [Martinez]. Since he arrived, he has undergone an incredible transformation.",
      "“He has always been a good player, but with great instinct, great power, he was a wild horse. Conte took him, educated him and raised him.",

      "Manchester City are interested in adding another midfielder to their ranks and believe they could beat Manchester United to the signing of Elliot Anderson in 2026, we can reveal.",
      "Pep Guardiola’s side already appear to have beaten their close rivals to Antoine Semenyo, and sources believe there is a feeling within the club that they could take a similar route with Anderson.",
      "Man City refuse to stand still as they move towards the final year of Guardiola’s reign and intend to use their current standing in the game to their advantage.",
      "Alongside the immediate goal of remaining competitive for silverware, there is also a long-term vision to ensure Guardiola leaves behind a squad capable of sustaining domestic dominance.",
      "Nottingham Forest are not keen to sell Anderson at present, but are aware that their stance is likely to be tested over the next six months.",
      "City are not expected to pursue a move in the winter window, instead planning to lay the groundwork ahead of the summer.",
      "They have been forced to cope without star midfielder Rodri for much of the season, and even as he returns to contention there remains a focus on ensuring the squad is protected against any future midfield setbacks.",
      "The next year is expected to bring further evolution, with City targeting additions at full-back, centre-back and central midfield, as well as Semenyo, as part of a wider recruitment plan.",
      "City intend to be active across both upcoming windows, looking to sharpen their options while also preparing for Guardiola’s departure, with his contract due to expire in 2027.",
      "Anderson is emerging as a key target and did little to harm his prospects with an impressive display in Nottingham Forest’s 2-1 defeat to City at the weekend.",
      "Manchester United retain a strong interest in the Forest midfielder and are prepared to invest heavily in a Premier League-proven talent.",
      "However, City hold the sporting edge over their rivals right now and there are indications they will look to position themselves early for talks capable of turning the player’s head.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "United are admirers of Premier League trio Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton, and there has been some speculation they could move for all three in 2026. However, our sources shut those rumours down on December 6.",
      "Graeme Bailey reported for TEAMtalk on December 2 that Forest have identified Lyon’s Tyler Morton as a potential replacement for Anderson.",
      "It was claimed on December 1 that Anderson would prefer to join City over United, and Guardiola’s side appear to be growing in confidence they can get the deal over the line.",
      "Forest are expected to demand £80-100million before letting the England star leave."

      "The end of the year means best-of lists and awards, doesn’t it?",
      "Gongs and baubles and flowers for the great and good. Well tits to that. We’re interested not in who’s been good but who’s been bad. And not even bad as in ‘not good’ but bad as in complete and utter pricks.",
      "This list is an absolute hive of scum and villainy, with the worst thing about it the sure and certain knowledge that the top two pricks are going to be even worse and even more prominent in 2026.",
      "",
      "Managed a pitiful 24 points between them from 57 Premier League games in the first half of 2025, denying everyone the chance to enjoy any kind of relegation fight.",
      "A pathetic effort all round and one put into context by even the weakest of the latest batch of promoted clubs this season. Burnley have more Premier League points this year from a game less than these three sorry individuals.",
      "The utter failure of these three to even put up a fight allowed certain clubs who shall remain nameless (not really, we’re going to name them literally immediately in this list) to completely sack the league off with no consequence. Well, no relegation-based consequence anyway. Infuriatingly bad.",
      "",
      "The trio of promoted clubs who adhered to the Homer Simpson principle that if something’s hard then it’s not worth doing meant that while a historically bad season for Manchester United was still funny, it wasn’t as funny as it could or should have been had it contained even a sliver of actual relegation peril.",
      "But mainly they get on this list for the unspeakable crime of being This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About and putting every single one of your eggs in a basket labelled ‘Simply beat the sport’s most notorious trophy-dodgers in a major final’ and then somehow managing to not even do that.",
      "Sure, everyone took the p*ss a bit but we still feel like this just isn’t talked about enough. Manchester United should be too embarrassed to leave the house after something like that. But it didn’t even cost anyone their jobs.",
      "And now they’re bumbling around being kind of halfway competent but not really. Unacceptable. They are no longer bad enough to be consistently amusing, nor good enough to be interesting. Because they’re only ‘good’ because standards have been allowed to fall so desperately low.",
      "Not one other post-Ferguson manager would have been able to get away with ‘Maybe nick a top-six spot with a following wind’ as an acceptable stretch goal. Ruben Amorim might be a genius; it might actually be the only way for Manchester United to escape the Fergie Era once and for all.",
      "Recalibrate the club so entirely that sometimes qualifying for Europe is good, actually.",
      "READ: Every Prem club’s best decision of 2025: signings, subs, shape switches…",
      "",
      "One of the single most absurd calendar years in Premier League history from this complete pack of pricks.",
      "Finally won a trophy, which was prickery in itself because Spurs’ only job is to make other clubs who don’t win trophies feel better about themselves. What are your Evertons and Villas supposed to do now? Well, as it turns out it’s ‘move into spectacular new stadium’ and ‘challenge for the actual title’ but that doesn’t give Spurs a pass.",
      "But what Spurs did in order to win a trophy was to completely abandon everything else. They stopped even pretending to try and get Premier League points – again, the pricks at the top of this list have a lot to answer for here – in order to win the Europa.",
      "And then decided that actually that wasn’t okay, that finishing 17th (albeit chasms clear of actual trouble) in order to win a trophy wasn’t acceptable. So they sacked the manager. And then got rid of the man who sacked the manager.",
      "And now they might finish 17th without even competing for a trophy anyway. There is a complete pointlessness to Spurs at the moment.",
      "Say what you like about trophy-dodging, at least it’s an ethos. At least the trophy drought provided some clarity of purpose; it’s now impossible to ascertain what Spurs are even trying to achieve.",
      "They’re not really trying to compete with the rest of the Big Six anymore, they’re not really trying to win trophies anymore because they’ve ticked that off and don’t really need to bother again apparently.",
      "Nobody knows what constitutes a good season for Spurs now, or more importantly who is actually in a position to decide. At least when Daniel Levy was around we all knew where we stood, but now he’s toddled off to spend more time with his CBE.",
      "",
      "A proud and storied football club is being allowed to rot. West Ham have been outside the Premier League for only four seasons in all, but relegation is looking increasingly likely after another wasted summer and unsuccessful manager sacking.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo will likely soon go the way of Graham Potter as scapegoats are sought for why things are going so terribly wrong for a club whose owners decided that there was money to be saved by limiting ambition every year to simply being better than whichever poor saps got promoted every season.",
      "The problem with making ‘Just stay in the Premier League’ the ceiling rather than floor of your ambitions, though, is that there is no margin for error when things go wrong. Or when Leeds and Sunderland turn up with unexpected confidence and a bit of actual ambition.",
      "West Ham have been sleepwalking towards this situation pretty much from the moment they moved to the London Stadium. If there was any point at all in giving up everything they had at Upton Park for the soulless, cavernous bowl that is the former Olympic Stadium then it was surely about increasing income and becoming more competitive on the pitch, not less.",
      "The Hammers aren’t the first or last team to give up an atmospheric old ground full of history and palpable energy, but they are definitely the ones who f*cked it the most. At least Tottenham and Everton got brilliant stadiums out of it, if not yet in Spurs’ case much evidence of the on-field improvement.",
      "West Ham fans have been asked to give up an awful lot that was precious to them, and ‘For what?’ is becoming an increasingly relevant and angry response.",
      "It was unacceptable when mere top-flight survival became the target; now they won’t even have that.",
      "",
      "Not a novel observation, but it really has grown exponentially more exhausting this year as more and more fanbases allow themselves to be sucked down the conspiracy rabbit-hole with Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "Every Premier League club now has a sizeable and loud coterie of supporters who are of the unshakeable belief that a conspiracy exists against their club. No refereeing decision can ever just be a refereeing decision now, it must always be part of the grand plan in which every governing body within English football is risking it all to conspire together to ensure Brighton remain tenth.",
      "And of course that nonsense now extends to other teams’ games, so there is never any escape. Matches not involving your team are scoured for incidents that would definitely have been treated differently “If that were us…”",
      "Fixture lists are scoured for evidence of bias. Referee appointments are considered important. The entirely ludicrous idea that referees from the north-west of England will always favour the teams from the north-west of England, because if there’s one thing we know for sure about football fans it’s that they definitely like all the teams from their local area rather than hating all but one of them more than anyone else.",
      "Which then in true cake-and-eat-it style means that those referees are then obviously biased against the north-west clubs, actually, because they are bitter rivals of the team they actually support. Like all the best conspiracy theories, everything is evidence that you’re right if you try hard enough.",
      "We imagine there must have been some pretty high-level meetings between shadowy figures from the PGMOL and the FA and the Premier League this week ahead of Arsenal v Aston Villa. We can’t wait to find out whether the conspiracy this week is the old favourite of making sure Arsenal don’t win the league because reasons, or putting Aston Villa back in their place because the Big Six must be favoured.",
      "Apart from Arsenal, obviously.",
      "",
      "Yes, you know who you are. You can stop egging on your most hard-of-thinking supporters as a deflection tactic please. It doesn’t end well for any of us to continue propagating the idea that none of this is real and everything is being controlled by a shadowy cabal of bastards.",
      "",
      "Broke the first rule of journalism by becoming the story and then revelled in rolling around in the big sh*t he’d left on the floor.",
      "By the end of the October international break it was already clear that The Media had made the decision that what was by then a low-stakes November break for England was going to be all about The Jude Bellingham Situation.",
      "But for one journalist in particular everything is always about The Jude Bellingham Situation. And absolutely not in a good way.",
      "Craig Hope works for the Daily Mail, an outlet which has routinely racially targeted English footballers. This is not new for Craig, who has been doing this to Jude Bellingham for a long time – dating back years.",
      "Is it any wonder Bellingham chose to play abroad & steers clear of… https://t.co/kRycu2RBhZ pic.twitter.com/an6cNFvLzz",
      "— Adam (@AdamJoseph) November 18, 2025",
      "As Mediawatch put it at the time, we’re not saying it’s about race, but when you write for the Daily Mail and are obsessed with one brilliant black footballer to this extent, then a lot of people will say that.",
      "Hope’s obsession reached a nadir with the bizarre ‘Ex players blaming media for fallout from Jude Bellingham’s petulance is like blaming the mirror for the haircut’ simile, coming out swinging on social media and sadly shaking his head that alas it was Bellingham’s antics that left Hope with absolutely no choice but to focus entirely on that rather than the football and conclusion to a flawless qualification campaign for England.",
      "We strongly suspect you, like us, can no longer even remember the specific antics Bellingham had got up to that left Hope so devoid of choices without looking it up.",
      "The crime? In Hope’s own words, ‘twice flapping his arms in opposition to his withdrawal’. Yes, Bellingham became the first player in football history to show mild disappointment at being substituted. He then applauded England fans, shook hands with Thomas Tuchel and sat down.",
      "Hope also used the second question of a press conference to highlight a push by Bellingham in the 10th minute of a 2-0 away World Cup qualifying win. Absolutely nobody else noticed or cared.",
      "We are already dreading what he’s got in store for us when, as overwhelming balance of probability inevitably suggests, England do not in fact win the World Cup.",
      "",
      "The sight of Evangelos Marinakis sat seething in his customary City Ground seat as the ungrateful worms that are his Nottingham Forest team had the temerity to lose to possibly the best team in the country was to be reminded of just how thoroughly he has inserted himself into Barclays lore over the last year.",
      "He didn’t come from nowhere. We’ve all been dimly aware of the outlandish cartoon villain in charge of Forest and his entertaining ways, but 2025 was his year in so many ways. This was the year where his main-character energy achieved mainstream crossover.",
      "It’s been a spectacularly prickish year for the big man, and who knows what 2026 may bring. We do really quite seriously want to see him run on to the pitch, ageing iPhone in hand, to remonstrate with Sean Dyche as he did so infamously with Nuno Espirito Santo towards the end of last season.",
      "We’re absolutely certain Dyche wouldn’t just stand there and take that utter woke nonsense like beta cuck Nuno did.",
      "That wild incident was key to the whole Marinakis character arc of 2025, though. Because what he was beyond furious about was that Nottingham Forest – Nottingham Forest! – had only managed to draw with Leicester and this had dented their Champions League – Champions League! – chances.",
      "The breathtaking speed with which entitlement took hold of Marinakis and Forest on the back of being Quite Good for Quite A While in an all-time-weak Premier League year was stunning to behold.",
      "Running out of steam on the home straight and not quite making it into the Champions League was, for Marinakis and others, an absolutely unacceptable end to a season that began, as all seasons for all but a handful of teams must, with avoiding relegation trouble as the primary goal.",
      "That Marinakis was so furious with the man more responsible than any other – himself included – for Forest being in a position where he was able to get quite so dangerously high on his own farts was just profoundly ungrateful and enormously Marinakis.",
      "The public nature of that specific outburst cemented his status. He was a main character now. And boy has he spent the rest of the year doubling down on that with some elite villainy.",
      "With Daniel Levy gone, Marinakis is now the Premier League club suit most likely to be pictured sat watching from the stands and requiring commentators, by ancient law, to say ‘penny for his thoughts’.",
      "And the great thing with Marinakis is that you don’t really need to spend that penny. Unlike the expressionless round head of Levy, Marinakis’ thoughts on any situation at any time are writ large across his features. Especially when he’s happy, but especially when he’s angry.",
      "Happy moments of Marinakis behaviour this season have included the entirely normal photo op he staged with Morgan Gibbs-White after convincing the number 10 to sign a new contract entirely and definitely of his own free will. That incident also reminds us that even acts of villainy can have unexpected outcomes; saving Gibbs-White from joining Spurs was far more of a kindness than any of us could have predicted at the time, even allowing for the undeniable and unending fact that Spurs are Spurs.",
      "There was also the undisguised glee he had over Forest’s promotion to the Europa League at Crystal Palace’s expense. We sort of admire the complete lack of pretence there. There was at least an honesty to it rather than some performative attempt at ‘Not the way we wanted to qualify but…’ response.",
      "This season, Marinakis’ core work in maintaining his profile and expanding his role has been to fall back on an old favourite. Manager sackings. Shrewd work. After the wild behaviour of the summer, there was no need to overcomplicate things. Why not simply fall back on a tried-and-trusted tactic?",
      "Nuno was doomed from the moment of that on-pitch dressing down, really. The surprise if anything was that a flimsy and unconvincing ceasefire lasted until a fair way into the new season. But not far enough for Nuno, the man who had just delivered Forest’s best league finish in 30 years, to claim victory in the Premier League Sack Race.",
      "Marinakis was only warming up, though, following that dramatic flourish with his greatest act of hubris yet. So quickly and utterly had Marinakis lost sight of where Forest had been just a year earlier and how quickly they could return to that status, that he appointed Ange Postecoglou.",
      "An absurd decision that still managed to exceed the most dire predictions, which were very dire indeed. And it’s only a matter of time before Dyche goes the same way in 2026 because this is just how Marinakis now rolls.",
      "Are Forest fast becoming the Premier League’s most unlikeable club?",
      "",
      "He’s football’s problem now. We’ve invited him in and now we don’t know what to do about it, do we?",
      "Sure, it was one thing when he was turning the Club World Cup into the Trump World Cup, because that was only the Club World Cup and nobody gives a sh*t. But we’ve already seen that he is going to do the same and more to make the actual World Cup that we do care about all about him as well.",
      "And football is going to indulge him like the massive Cheeto-hued toddler that he is in the desperate hope that this vast yet desperately insecure ego can be placated to keep him onside enough not to just smash everything to pieces.",
      "He’s threatening to take games away from cities he believes have wronged him. He continues to agitate and threaten other countries, including the two neighbours who are co-hosting this bloody tournament.",
      "We still fully expect him to make a serious suggestion that actually it would be better if they just had all the games in America, wouldn’t it.",
      "What do we do then? Give him another fake shiny thing in the hope it distracts him until August?",
      "",
      "Has always been a highly objectionable character, but is now in truly unprecedented waters after his nauseating fawning over the Trump. Inventing an award to give him so he won’t have a tantrum, like trying to stop the arsehole little brother from spoiling someone else’s birthday party, was bad but we could just about understand the tactic.",
      "Trying to keep that lunatic happy does make some depressing sense. But does he have to be so actually delighted about it? It would be easier to give Infantino a pass if he didn’t constantly come across as the second person on the entire planet to actually think Trump deserves a FIFA peace prize, or that a FIFA peace prize is in fact a real thing.",
      "Turning the World Cup draw into a political rally for one of the most deeply divisive leaders of any major western power was an unprecedented lurch into some deeply unsettling waters, as was unequivocally throwing the full weight of the world’s biggest sport behind that leader.",
      "You don’t get to speak for the entire sport like that, Gianni. You don’t speak in our names. And we don’t want to hear a single word ever again from the ‘keep politics out of football’ brigade when rainbow armbands or Black Lives Matter or anything else like it comes up. Not after they watched FIFA officially declare the biggest event in the entire sport the MAGA World Cup.",
      "And the worst thing? The sure and certain knowledge that these two are guaranteed to be top of the list again in 12 months’ time having been even worse pricks at the actual tournament.",
      "We can already picture them getting in Harry Kane’s way at the trophy lift and ruining everything.",
      "Ruben Amorim showed once more that his priority is proving his methods work, which will always be incompatible with Manchester United’s ambitions…",
      "Arsenal are the Premier League 2025 Calendar Year champions! But their triumph comes with a whopping, great big asterisk…",
      "Leandro Trossard has one Liverpool fan thinking wistfully of Diogo Jota, while there is plenty of chatter about the latest episode of Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Antoine Semenyo moving to Manchester City could set in motion a transfer domino effect that reaches as far as Liverpool and Arsenal…",
      "There’s only one winner in the Premier League managers of 2025 battle, and it’s not the winner of the actual or the calendar year title.",
      "Ruben Amorim is really asking for trouble at Manchester United, with his side reaching a new low against Wolves on an exposing night…"

      "It was a dismal display by Ruben Amorim's side on a night they could have moved into the top four with a victory, but they could hardly claim to deserve the points as Rob Edwards picked up his first point as Wolves head coach at the eighth attempt.",
      "After beating Newcastle with a back four, Amorim returned to his favoured three-man defence for the visit of Wolves and United took the lead when Joshua Zirkzee's shot deflected in off Ladislav Krejci. Benjamin Sesko struck the post soon afterwards.",
      "But United, seeking back-to-back clean sheets for the first time under Amorim, allowed Wolves back into it and needed Senne Lammens to save well from Hugo Bueno even before Zirkzee's misdirected clearance was latched onto by Krejci for the leveller.",

      "In failing to beat a team that had lost their last 12 games in all competitions, United missed the chance to move into the top four. Wolves' predicament remains grim, this just their third point of the season. But it was their night. And it is Amorim facing questions.",

      "There are extenuating circumstances, clearly. Manchester United are without some of their most creative players right now. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are away at the Africa Cup of Nations. Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Kobbie Mainoo are injured.",
      "But when you draw at home to a Wolves team that had lost their previous 12 matches in all competitions, there will be scrutiny. Particularly when Ruben Amorim switched back to his favoured back three to 'match up' with a side still winless in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim talked of the difficulty in relying on inexperienced players afterwards but he introduced one - Jack Fletcher - when removing Joshua Zirkzee, United's goalscorer, at the interval. \"It was tactical,\" he confirmed. They could not deal with Wolves' midfield, he argued.",
      "If that change was strange, the like-for-like substitution of Ayden Heaven - perhaps United's best outfield player again - for Leny Yoro was also difficult for supporters to understand. They booed that late switch, having booed the team off at half-time and full-time.",
      "Amorim remains confident, he insists, that United will be far stronger when his stars are back but the frustration is that the opportunity is being missed in the here and now. His team could have gone fourth with a better display against the bottom club.",
      "Five of the last seven games in which they have scored first have not been won. Home games against 10-man Everton, a woeful West Ham, a Bournemouth side they were beating three times and now this Wolves team, adrift in the table, have not been won.",
      "And the worry is that Amorim is a big part of the reason for that. The man in whom everyone is supposed to trust sometimes feels like a stumbling block to success rather than the architect of it. Leeds and Burnley await. Those games come with real risk now.Adam Bate",
      "Martin Odegaard's role in Arsenal's second goal against Aston Villa typified all he brings Mikel Arteta's side at his best. First, the off-the-ball alertness to pounce on Youri Tielemans' loose pass. Then a through-ball so perfectly measured that Martin Zubimendi didn't even need to break his stride.",
      "His starring performance at the Emirates Stadium came only three days after he performed to a similarly high level in the win over Brighton. It's a goal and an assist in two games for him now but those numbers do not tell the full story.",
      "After an injury-hit start to the season, the Arsenal captain finally looks back at something approaching his best form. He led Arsenal players for touches, final-third passes, chances created and shots on Tuesday night, his influence clear.",
      "For Mikel Arteta, it was only ever a question of time. \"He needed some consistency as well and some games,\" he said in his press conference. \"Obviously, he had two times the shoulder injury, then he had a big knee injury, and that takes a little bit of time.",
      "\"Now you can see that he is flowing, that his energy level is back to where it is, and that he's affecting the game in a great way.",
      "\"I think he was very, very good today.\"",
      "His work on the ball against Villa was complemented by a familiar level of intensity out of possession. Odegaard contested more duels than any other Arsenal player and won possession the most times too. Only Zubimendi ran further than his 11.2km.",
      "Carry on like this, in all facets of his game, and a player who has come to split opinion among Arsenal supporters could prove a difference-maker in the Premier League title race.Nick Wright",
      "Mateus Mane delivered a player of the match performance for Wolves in their shock draw at Manchester United and in a season in which the supporters have been starved of positives, the 18-year-old academy prospect has become the fans' new darling.",
      "They chanted his name throughout, a new song to the tune of Zombie by The Cranberries, and roared with delight when he tackled former favourite Matheus Cunha. Mane played with energy and quality, just days after lasting the full 90 minutes at Anfield.",
      "It is the tactical flexibility that has impressed Rob Edwards. A more natural winger, he was moved inside midway through the game against Liverpool and had been lined up for a No 10 role at Old Trafford until Santi Bueno's withdrawal forced a change of plan.",
      "\"Today obviously things have changed and he is playing as an eight,\" explained Edwards. \"So to show that level of understanding, really, really impressive. He took the ball, didn't look fazed, played with bravery, but then his work-rate as well.",
      "\"That recovery late on against Casemiro, [after] I think he tried a little backheel. That's the stuff that we need. It's great that an 18-year-old at the moment is showing that display.\" It might not keep Wolves up but Mane is helping to change the mood.Adam Bate",
      "Newcastle have looked their best under Eddie Howe when they play with speed, aggression and verticality.",
      "That edge has been missing at times this season, especially away from home.",
      "Where Nick Woltemade offers presence, structure and link play between the lines, Yoane Wissa brings a bit of chaos and directness. He runs the channels, pulls centre-backs wide and asks uncomfortable questions of defensive units that want to hold a compact shape.",
      "Against Burnley, that difference was obvious within minutes and Newcastle managed to score twice inside seven of them.",
      "Two goals in two starts, capped by a decisive contribution in the win over Burnley, has quickly thrust Wissa back into the spotlight.",
      "The early signs suggest Newcastle now have two different attacking profiles for different types of games.Lewis Jones",
      "Aston Villa had the suspensions of Matty Cash and Boubacar Kamara to add to a four-player injury list against Arsenal. The result was a weakened starting line-up and a depleted bench which included three untested teenagers.",
      "Unai Emery might now have to add Amadou Onana to the absentee list against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Aston Villa were matching Arsenal at the time of his enforced withdrawal due to injury at half-time. It all went wrong after that.",
      "Arsenal were excellent in the second period, of course, but they were also far fresher, with Villa having played out a similarly draining away game against Chelsea only three days earlier. They had gone to their limits to extend their winning run to 11 games.",
      "Emery was also justified in questioning the scheduling which pitted them against Arsenal for a second time this season before having faced all of the other 18 sides, with their first game against Forest still to come. A quirk of the fixture list maybe, but one that hurt them as their winning run was brought to an untimely end.Nick Wright",
      "Burnley's relegation fight has been defined by fine margins and missed moments, but Armando Broja's performance in the defeat to Newcastle offered something they have been craving for months: an authority up top.",
      "From the first whistle, Broja played with purpose. He ran channels aggressively, pinned centre-backs and demanded the ball with his body as much as his voice. This was the Broja who bursts through defenders rather than bouncing off them. The Broja who looks like a Premier League striker rather than one searching for rhythm.",
      "It gives Burnley something to build from. The gap to safety is still only six points. Teams that go down often do so long before the points column confirms it. They can be mentally beaten. Burnley aren't there yet and Broja is central to that resistance.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton boss David Moyes praised his squad, with specific reference to players like Nathan Patterson who came into the game short of regular minutes, following the 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Injuries to Michael Keane and Charly Alcaraz for this fixture only added to their problems. Moyes said he was working with around 30 per cent of the squad after the game and he was right.",
      "Through a combination of international duty at AFCON and injuries, Everton are threadbare.",
      "Only two players on their bench this evening - Jack Grealish and Beto - had a Premier League appearance to their name.",
      "The Toffees are within touching distance of the top five but if they want to keep that positioning - or even build on it - they need reinforcements.",
      "Waiting for players to return isn't enough. The January transfer window could be arriving at the perfect time.Patrick Rowe",
      "The Hammers are still hurting after their draw with Brighton. An eight-game winless run has done nothing to shake off their relegation fears as they enter the New Year.",
      "Mistakes are still being made - there were a couple of early misplaced passes out the back that create unnecessary pressure. And lessons weren't learned - it was no surprise West Ham conceded two first-half penalties via sloppy challenges.",
      "It was Ollie Scarles' costly error on Saturday against Fulham, then it was Max Kilman's lazy leg and Lucas Paqueta's needless rugby tackle against Brighton. All basic errors.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has praised West Ham's spirit but that only takes you so far. Barring a few Jarrod Bowen and Paqueta moments, there needs to be more quality in this Hammers team, or 2026 is the year they go down.Sam Blitz",
      "Brighton's draw to West Ham means that manager Fabian Hurzeler has yet to win a Premier League game in December in 12 attempts (D7, L5) - the most games ever by a PL coach without winning. The Seagulls' current winless run now stands at six games, and sees them two points worse off than at this point last year.",
      "Entering into 2026, it seems the German's side are suffering many of the same problems they faced in 2024. Brighton's gung-ho style has produced a lack of consistency prominent over both of Brighton's seasons under their manager.",
      "Today may have been a point gained - with Brighton coming from behind twice - but it so easily could have been more. 61 per cent possession, 2.85 xG and an avoidable penalty all evidence that Brighton need not have shared the spoils against an opponent with the second-worst home form in the league.",
      "But what seems so much more the cause of recent poor form is less quantifiable. The Seagulls never seem to know when to take the sting out of a game. Even in the last 20 minutes, which Brighton dominated, there were signs of vulnerability. Brighton attacked relentlessly - and West Ham always looked like they were one good through ball away from scoring the winner.",
      "Hurzeler has clearly proven he has the talent to manage at this level. But Brighton's lack of progression over his tenure - and runs of poor form during back-to-back festive periods - cast doubt over how much better they can get whilst lacking the street smarts that the Brighon head coach needs so badly to acquire.Noah Langford",

      "Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-German are also thought to be tracking his development closely.",
      "The teenager has scored seven goals and contributed four assists in 16 appearances in all competitions for Leipzig this season.",
      "Diomande has started both of Ivory Coast's matches at AFCON and has two goals in five appearances for his country.",
      "Speaking to Marcel Schafer alongside a number of other reporters in September, the RB Leipzig managing director for sport held up Diomande as an example of a \"young jewel\" identified as part of the club's rebuild this season following such a disappointing season.",
      "After eight consecutive European campaigns, Leipzig missed out on continental competition for the first time since their ascension to the German top flight and the signing of Diomande from Spanish side Leganes reflected the need for a refresh.",
      "\"He definitely fits in the profile we are looking for,\" Schafer explained. \"Young, hungry and high potential. Even though he was just six months in Spain, he had really some impressive appearances in LaLiga and we looked for these kind of players.\"",
      "He added: \"We look for players who have a physical ability and we look for players who can handle one on one, who can create chances and who are able to finish some actions. Diomande has certainly demonstrated that in his debut Bundesliga season.\"",
      "The teenager scored on his Leipzig debut in the cup before netting in three consecutive appearances in October and bagging a hat-trick against Freiburg just before travelling out to Morocco to represent Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "The prospect of losing Diomande so quickly would not have been part of the plan when they paid €20m to sign him in the summer but Leipzig are pragmatic about their business model, honing young talent and selling them on for a significant profit.",

      "Tuesday 30 December 2025 08:47, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United's days of solely playing with a back three are over and revealed he refrained from changing formation earlier to ensure his players did not feel he was caving in to media pressure.",
      "\"But when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim started with a back four for the first time as United head coach in the win over Newcastle on Boxing Day - when he was without a number of key players because of injury and the Africa Cup of Nations - after signs of the team showing greater in-game flexibility in recent weeks.",
      "The 40-year-old had been defiant in the face of intense scrutiny about his unwillingness to alter his formation amid alarming results which led to his side finishing 15th in the league last season, insisting he would only change at a time of his choosing even if it cost him his job.",
      "Amorim, who has overseen improved results this season, admits player availability has forced his hand somewhat, but believes his squad are now ready to change because they understand his philosophy.",
      "\"We are trying to build an identity. Today is a different moment. We don't have a lot of players [so] we need to adapt, but I already know that they understand why we are changing.",
      "\"It is not because of the pressure of you guys [journalists] or the fans. It is because now we understand the way we want to play and the principles are the same. We can change the system.",
      "\"I think we are going to become a better team because when all the players return we are not going to play all the time with three defenders. We are going to improve. That was something that I was talking about.",
      "\"But then when you [journalists] talk about changing the system all the time, I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of you. I think that is the end for the manager.",
      "\"When we are playing well in our system, I think that is the moment to change, if it is a better thing to win the next game. That is what we did [against Newcastle].\"",
      "There were certainly eyebrows raised in the room when Amorim explained that his reluctance to switch formation earlier had been because of fears that his own Manchester United players would perceive it as him bowing to media pressure.",
      "Given that Amorim's unflinching honesty has been as consistent as his commitment to his 3-4-3 formation, there is little reason to question the sincerity of his comments, only the logic behind them. If he always intended to adapt then why now? Why not earlier?",
      "His argument has been that the priority was to ensure his players knew the system inside and out, being able to perfect it before expanding the repertoire. But results have hardly been so stellar as to be persuaded that this is now the case. And he has had time.",
      "A squad depleted by absences and stretched by a more demanding fixture list might explain why the Boxing Day fixture against Newcastle was an opportune moment. But it would require the memory of a goldfish not to look back and find many others too.",
      "How about August at Grimsby when Mason Mount was wedged in at left wing-back? What about the September defeat to Brentford when Mount came on in the same position? Gary Neville described that decision as \"absolutely ridiculous\" at the time.",
      "United lost a European final in May in which Amorim was so steadfast in sticking to his formation that he made like-for-like substitutes with his team chasing not just a trophy but the transformative Champions League qualification that victory would bring.",
      "Without European football, he has had not only had a pre-season to prepare but that exit to Grimsby has afforded United a particularly light schedule. That time has been spent training in different systems but it has taken until Christmas for a formation shift.",
      "Within three points of the top four, Amorim's belated flexibility could yet come to be regarded as a masterstroke, an example of his patient evolution of this team. But after a year of making the case that his formation was non-negotiable, it remains a curious call.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "Wednesday 31 December 2025 15:45, UK",
      "Arsenal are likely to be quiet in January after a busy summer as they feel the squad is capable of winning the Premier League title and it has already been put to the test with a raft of injuries.",
      "Mikel Arteta has said Arsenal \"have to be actively looking\" at the market in January after losing more players than they had anticipated.",
      "Arsenal will always keep their eyes open for unique market opportunities - elite players or longer-term targets. However, it is accepted deals of that magnitude are usually rare in the January window.",
      "Arsenal have been looking at the European market for young players with potential and are understood to have scouted Elche midfielder Rodrigo Mendoza, AC Milan full-back Davide Bartesaghi and Eintracht Frankfurt forward Jean-Matteo Bahoya.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "The only way that could change is with a significant sale(s) - but Villa want to keep their key players as they close in on a Premier League title bid.",
      "Morgan Rogers, Ollie Watkins, John McGinn and Matty Cash attracted interest in the summer, but all those players, apart from Watkins, have signed new deals since, while the England striker has more than two years left on his Villa deal. The club have no desire to change anything in the first team given they are on a historic 10-game winning run.",
      "The futures of several peripheral players are more interesting, especially Harvey Elliott, although a solution looks clouded. He appears caught between the terms of his loan, a desire to play and a less-than-convinced Unai Emery.",
      "Elliott's summer move from Liverpool becomes permanent for £35m if he makes a certain number of appearances, but the Villa boss has said this outcome is \"not definitely\" going to happen.",
      "He has already played for both Liverpool and Villa this season, so he cannot play for a third club unless it is one beginning a new season in the New Year. That means the only leagues he could switch to before the summer are the MLS, which begins in late February, or the Scandinavian countries, which begin in March. The other solution would be to go back to Liverpool, but, in all likelihood, still not play regularly.",
      "One bit of business Villa have already wrapped up ahead of the January window is the addition of 19-year-old winger Alysson, who is set to join from Brazilian club Gremio as a development player. He could end up costing Villa more than £10m.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ross Barkley.",
      "Manchester City are closing in on a full agreement to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth with the final details of his £65m release clause being discussed between the clubs.",
      "In response, Bournemouth will want to sign a winger to replace him and have had ample time to find someone, given Semenyo almost left in the summer.",
      "Apart from that, Bournemouth are also looking to recruit at centre-back and goalkeeper if the right players are available to improve Andoni Iraola's squad.",
      "The search for a centre-back with height and presence is in part down to Marcos Senesi, a mainstay in Iraola's defence, being out of contract at the end of the season. As things stand, he will be leaving this summer and reports have suggested that is what he plans to do.",
      "Despite signing Djordje Petrovic to replace the outgoing Kepa Arrizabalaga over the summer, Bournemouth are looking to recruit a goalkeeper again to find someone who can compete with the ex-Chelsea man for the No 1 spot.",
      "Bournemouth are in a strong position to go back into the market after a summer window in which they had the best net spend in the Premier League, thanks to selling key players Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid, Ilya Zabarnyi to Paris Saint-Germain and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool.",
      "There is an appetite on the south coast to make signings.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marcos Senesi and Adam Smith.",
      "Brentford's recruitment priority is a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around, with Vitaly Janelt on course to leave the club in 2026 and their other options in that position approaching the latter stages of their careers.",
      "Janelt's current contract expires next summer and talks over a new deal have not found an agreement so far. The 27-year-old can talk to foreign clubs in January about a pre-contract for next summer, so Brentford are actively scouting for long-term replacements. They have been looking in several markets including Holland, where they particularly like Feyenoord's Quinten Timber and PSV's Joey Veerman.",
      "Centre-back is another position Brentford are looking at amid long-standing interest from Wolfsburg in Kristoffer Ajer and Ethan Pinnock entering the last 18 months of his contract. The club are have a long list of potential replacements and are among those that like Coventry's Bobby Thomas.",
      "Another top left-winger is also a long-term ambition, with Reiss Nelson only on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season. They tried hard in the summer for Max Beier from Borussia Dortmund to no avail. Could they try again?",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Vitaly Janelt, Mathias Jensen (club hold option to extend), Rico Henry (club hold option to extend) and Josh Dasilva (club hold option to extend).",
      "Brighton are expected to try and sign a successor to Carlos Baleba as part of their January transfer plans, as well as potentially a right-back and left-sided centre-back. They could also look at new strikers.",
      "Brighton plan to repeat their successful succession planning in midfield by having a replacement when Baleba moves on. Moises Caicedo was already in place when Yves Bissouma joined Tottenham and Baleba was signed in the same month Caicedo joined Chelsea.",
      "There are also other issues at play in midfield, with Mats Weifer moving out to right-back this season, James Milner out of contract in the summer, and also Marseille's desire to hold talks over the permanent signing of midfielder Matt O'Riley, who is currently on a straight loan there, also playing into their thinking.",
      "Experienced right-sided defender Joel Veltman is another player out of contract at the end of the season and Brighton have been looking at new options at right-back since at least last summer.",
      "At centre-back, Lewis Dunk has triggered an option to extend his Brighton contract beyond the end of this season by meeting an appearances threshold, but the injured Adam Webster is in the final year of his deal and so a newcomer in this position is wanted.",
      "With Danny Welbeck also out of contract, Brighton must look at long-term striker options too. Fabian Hurzeler has said there is a chance Evan Ferguson could return from a loan at Roma as one option, while the club are always scouting for the next best talent.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Danny Welbeck, James Milner, Joel Veltman, Solly March (club hold option to extend), Adam Webster.",
      "Burnley are facing an uphill task if they are to avoid relegation and are therefore planning to be busy in January to make a fist of trying to stay up.",
      "Although there is money to spend, they are particularly looking in the loan market so as not to get caught with big wages and big fees if they ultimately go down.",
      "Given it is a World Cup year, there are lots of players around the Premier League and Europe not playing regularly who are looking to make a case to their respective national teams.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Martin Dubravka, Josh Laurent, Vaclav Hladky, Ashley Barnes.",
      "Chelsea will not pursue a move for Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo after making an enquiry about signing him in January.",
      "No major arrivals are expected at Stamford Bridge in January with the focus firmly on the summer windows in 2026 and 2027. Next month will be about moving on those fringe players that the club could not shift in the previous window.",
      "Raheem Sterling, Axel Disasi and Tyrique George were all available for transfer in the summer and could be on the move this time around.",
      "Sterling is the only player that remains in the 'Bomb Squad' after Disasi returned to first-team training in November, but finding a move for the winger will likely be more complicated because he wants to stay in London for his family and is on big wages.",
      "Despite Disasi's return to training, a January exit is still likely. Sunderland, Bournemouth and West Ham showed interest in him over the summer, while he was also offered to Crystal Palace, and Chelsea are expecting the centre-back to attract more suitors in the January window.",
      "Chelsea have been impressed by George this season, but he wants to play regularly and there is so much competition for places across the front positions, which is limiting his game time. He nearly joined Fulham on Deadline Day and there is expected to be interest in him again.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: None.",
      "Marc Guehi's future tops the agenda at Selhurst Park after he nearly joined Liverpool on Deadline Day. His contract expires at the end of the season and this is the club's last chance to cash in.",
      "Palace believe Liverpool are the only club looking to sign him for a fee in January and clubs around Europe are queuing up to sign the England international on a free transfer next July. He can talk to foreign teams about a pre-contract agreement from January 1 and Bayern Munich are one club expected to approach him.",
      "Palace head coach Oliver Glasner has said he expects Guehi to stay until the summer, but chairman Steve Parish has suggested in previous comments over the summer that he would be reluctant to let him walk away for nothing.",
      "Guehi holds most of the cards and it remains unclear what his decision will be, with Barcelona, Manchester City and Real Madrid also potentially there for a free transfer next summer.",
      "Glasner has been critical about Palace's summer business in general, feeling there was not enough investment, and there is uncertainty around his future with his contract up in the summer as well, not helping with clarity for any potential incomings.",
      "The Palace boss has said he expects one or two signings in January and they want another forward given Ismaila Sarr is now at AFCON.",
      "Palace have agreed a £34m deal with Tottenham for Brennan Johnson but the winger is yet to make a final decision over his future.",
      "Palace are also actively looking at right-wing back options in the wake of Daniel Munoz's knee injury, in case it keeps him out for an extended period. Their other options, Nathaniel Clyne and Rio Cardines, are not quite at the level to provide cover long-term.",
      "Palace are eager to tie Daichi Kamada to a new deal with his current contract up at the end of the season. As it stands, from January, he will be free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs over a potential free transfer at the end of the season.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Marc Guehi, Daichi Kamada, Nathaniel Clyne, Jefferson Lerma (club hold option to extend), Naouirou Ahamada.",
      "Everton are expected to be active in January and are prioritising the signing of a striker as they aim to add a different profile to their current options, Thierno Barry and Beto.",
      "Ivan Toney, who is attracting interest from a number of Premier League clubs, is a player that Everton have had a look at, but any deal would likely be expensive. Toney is open to returning to the Premier League, especially as England World Cup places are still to be decided, but Al Ahli do not want to lose him at this stage.",
      "David Moyes would prefer Premier League experience, even on loan, and Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee is another player they like, but he wants to stay and there would be competition from Roma and others.",
      "Everton are keen to add a specialised right-back with Jake O'Brien and James Garner often filling in at the position, and with club captain Seamus Coleman, 37, nearing the end of his contract - and career.",
      "There is also desire to sign a central midfielder, even on loan, to cover for the loss of Idrissa Gueye, who has gone to AFCON. Kobbie Mainoo and Kalvin Phillips, both of whom possess the Premier League experience Moyes wants, are players Everton like.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: James Garner (club hold option to extend), Vitaliy Mykolenko, Michael Keane (club hold option to extend), Idrissa Gueye (club hold option to extend), Seamus Coleman, Harry Tyrer.",
      "Fulham are expected to be active with central midfielder, winger and striker on the list of positions they want to strengthen.",
      "Signing a top No 8-type midfielder was a big priority in the summer, missing out on players like Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Everton, and Alex Iwobi - one of three players Fulham lose to Nigeria at AFCON - has filled in there, so there is still a strong desire to bring in a player of that profile.",
      "Summer signing Samuel Chukwueze, who has recently impressed, is another that goes to AFCON, while Adama Traore is in the final year of his deal and attracting interest from West Ham in January, so Fulham are also exploring winger options ahead of his potential departure. Getting Harry Wilson to sign a new contract is also a priority.",
      "Up-front, Fulham have two good striking options in Raul Jimenez and Rodrigo Muniz, but Muniz is recovering from surgery and the club must plan for the future without Jimenez given he is now 34 and into the final year of his contract. One striker Fulham liked in the summer was Romulo before he joined RB Leipzig.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ryan Sessegnon, Harry Wilson, Adama Traore, Raul Jimenez, Tom Cairney.",
      "Leeds are in the market for attacking players to boost their survival chances, but have said they are maxing out PSR this season, which means there will be limitations to how much business can be done and increases the likelihood of loans.",
      "There is an expectation at the club that there will be at least one signing in January, but it is hard to foresee Leeds bringing in any more than two. Leeds' failed attempt to sign Harry Wilson on Deadline Day shows that there is some wiggle room financially.",
      "Sales could be an option to create more financial headroom for January signings and Daniel Farke has said the club should be open to the possibility if it can improve the team, but insists there are no plans to move any of his players on.",
      "The chances of the Wilson deal being revived in January are slim because the two clubs are close to each other in the table and the forward is now playing a starring role at Fulham, although his deal is up in the summer and there has been no resolution over his future.",
      "Leeds still want to bring in a player of Wilson's profile with Dan James' injury leaving them even shorter on wingers and they are also exploring potential deals for strikers to add more depth up front.",
      "Signing a centre-back is also a possibility in January for Leeds after the change in formation to 3-5-2 if the right deal materialises, although improving the forward line is the priority.",
      "The Leeds boss has shown his team's flexibility in recent games by switching to a back four mid-game to come back in draws against Liverpool, Brentford and Sunderland and so the club have options to manage the centre-back situation.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Illan Meslier, Sam Byram, Karl Darlow, Alex Cairns.",
      "Liverpool could be busy again in this transfer window, even after spending over £200m net last summer, especially after their struggles this season and Mohamed Salah putting his future firmly on the agenda.",
      "Arne Slot insists he no longer has an issue to resolve with Salah after restoring him to the squad, but little time has passed since the Egypt forward's bombshell interview and questions will continue to be asked amid strong interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "Salah is currently at AFCON and may not return until late in the window if Egypt go deep in the tournament, which would kick the can down the road. As it stands, Liverpool have had no official contact from a Saudi Pro League club and focus in the Middle East has been on the summer.",
      "Liverpool would have signed Guehi for £35m on Deadline Day had Palace not pulled the plug at the last minute, and they will remain reluctant to overpay for a player that will soon be available on a free transfer. There is significant competition that they were clearly keen to get ahead of in the summer, for the right price. Guehi, of course, was ready to move to Anfield in the summer.",
      "The Guehi situation has also been somewhat tied to Ibrahima Konate, who is also out of contract in the summer. Although Liverpool have remained committed to re-signing him to a new contract, they will not budge from their existing wage structure. Konate has had interest from Real Madrid.",
      "Bringing in a holding midfielder has also been on the agenda since Slot's first summer in charge when Martin Zubimendi turned down a move to Anfield, but the impressive performances of Ryan Gravenberch as the No 6 have so far put those plans on ice. Their other option, the 32-year-old Waturo Endo, has made only five Premier League appearances and enters the last 18 months of his deal in January.",
      "Andy Robertson is another player whose deal is up at the end of the season, but the 31-year-old has said he is relaxed about the situation. The left-back chose to stay at Anfield in the summer amid interest from Atletico Madrid and wants to resolve his future in private.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Freddie Woodman, Rhys Williams.",
      "Manchester City are closing in on a full agreement to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth with the final details of his £65m release clause being discussed between the clubs.",
      "Signing another elite left winger has been on their radar since the summer, when they tried for Rodrygo from Real Madrid and were willing to sell Savinho, who has since signed a new contract, to Spurs had that happened.",
      "Pep Guardiola has ruled out back-up goalkeeper James Trafford leaving in January despite the England international becoming unsettled over his role with Gianluigi Donnarumma the clear first-choice, but City are open to Stefan Ortega leaving.",
      "Long-term, City are also looking at central midfield cover for Tijjani Reijnders, with Mateo Kovacic injured and getting older, and Bernardo Silva out of contract in the summer.",
      "Right-back was an area City looked at in the summer but the impressive performances of Matheus Nunes in that position have knocked that down the priority list. Tino Livramento has been a long-term target, but Newcastle have no plans to let him go.",
      "City are one of the clubs with an interest in signing Marc Guehi on a free transfer next summer, with John Stones in the final year of his contract plus Nathan Ake soon turning 31.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Bernardo Silva, John Stones, Stefan Ortega, Marcus Bettinelli.",
      "Manchester United look set to miss out on Antoine Semenyo to rivals Manchester City but spending £65m on the winger in January could have potentially reduced their summer budget.",
      "While they are not currently at risk of breaching PSR, such an outlay could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, when a defensive midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "So that might be why they are only willing to let Kobbie Mainoo leave the club for a significant fee, rather than on loan. A string of Premier League clubs are interested, though only a handful could afford a permanent deal for his value.",
      "As far as Ruben Amorim is concerned, Mainoo remains a key part of his plans and there is a desire for him to stay at Old Trafford, despite asking to leave on loan in the summer and hardly playing since. What is difficult to predict is how the player might react if he stays on the fringes and how that could impact the club's stance.",
      "United's long-term bid for midfield reinforcements is regardless of Mainoo's future, and more because Casemiro is expected to leave in the summer when his contract expires. The priority is to bring in a top No 6-type in the summer and they have interest in the likes of Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Angelo Stiller among others.",
      "Centre-back is another position that United are looking at but again more likely for the summer, with Harry Maguire currently out of contract at the end of the season. The England international, who joined United in 2019, has said he does not know what the future holds for him.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Harry Maguire, Casemiro (club hold option to extend), Tom Heaton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis means Newcastle may now have to look to bring in reinforcements in January. Tino Livramento has a minor injury on the same knee he suffered an ACL rupture which requires caution but that is not straightforward in their situation.",
      "Newcastle have been looking around for right-backs already with Kieran Tripper's contract up at the end of the season. He has attracted interest from Saudi Arabia and Europe. As things stand, he is free to discuss a pre-contract with foreign clubs from January.",
      "Lewis Miley has shown he can cover at full-back but Newcastle are concerned about the number of options available to them heading into the busy festive period. That raises the possibility of a potential incoming in the January transfer window.",
      "Defenders Dan Burn, Tino Livramento, Sven Botman, Trippier and Emil Krafth are currently out injured. Lewis Hall has also been dealing with a hamstring strain which is far from ideal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Fabian Schar, Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Emil Krafth, Max Thompson, Mark Gillespie.",
      "Nottingham Forest are always open to doing business and they are looking at potentially add in midfield in January. Ibrahim Sangare has left for AFCON and they are monitoring the market for defensive midfielders and box-to-box options.",
      "Douglas Luiz, a loan signing from Juventus, has also been beset by injury on his return to the Premier League and his move to Forest only becomes permanent if certain conditions, thought to be number of appearances, are met.",
      "Forest have also been exploring left-back options despite having Neco Williams and Oleksandr Zinchenko. The Ukraine international, on loan from Arsenal, has struggled with injury this season and is yet to break back into the team since returning to fitness.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Angus Gunn and Willy Boly.",
      "Sunderland have a large squad so their focus is expected to be on outgoing moves for players not playing regularly or out of contract in the summer.",
      "Ian Poveda, Aji Alese, Joe Anderson, Timothee Pembele, Abdoullah Ba, Leo Hjelde, Ahmed Abdullahi and Ben Middlemas have not made a single appearance this season, while a string of others are not getting regular games such as goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, centre-back Luke O'Nien and midfielder Dan Neil.",
      "Neil and Anderson are also one of nine players whose contracts expire in the summer so can speak to foreign clubs from January 1.",
      "Sunderland's squad has outstripped expectations so not a huge amount of incoming work is being looked at. It is understood the club are looking to make an addition or two though, mainly on the wings, but also possibly a defensive midfielder.",
      "They have lost Bertrand Traore, Arthur Masuaku, Noah Sadiki, Chemsdine Talbi, Reinaldo Mandava and Habib Diarra to AFCON.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Dennis Cirkin, Dan Neil, Bertrand Traore, Jay Matete, Joe Anderson, Harrison Jones, Blondy Nna Noukeu, Simon Moore.",
      "Tottenham are expecting to do business in January, especially among the forward line, but also potentially strengthening the left side of defence. If they do, it could also mean outgoings.",
      "Injured trio James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke were Spurs' main source of goals and assists last season, along with Heung-Min Son, but they have all been missing, which means Thomas Frank has had to try and find a new formula in attack.",
      "Antoine Semenyo was of long-term interest but Spurs ended their pursuit of the Ghana forward. They wanted to sign Savinho from Manchester City in the summer but he stayed and signed a new deal.",
      "Spurs could also look to sign a new No 9, which would see others move out wide, but this depends on the quality of the player available and may have repercussions for the likes of Richarlison and Brennan Johnson.",
      "Crystal Palace have agreed a £34m fee with Spurs for Johnson, who is yet to make a final decision over his future amid interest from Bournemouth. The Wales international has struggled for game time under Frank this season.",
      "Richarlison has been sharing the striker position with Randal Kolo Muani in the absence of Solanke, but he was offered to Palace as a makeweight in a potential deal for Eberechi Eze in the summer, so doubts about his long-term future at Spurs remain.",
      "Spurs were interested in signing a left-sided centre-back in the summer only for other positions to take priority but it remains a position they are keen to add in ahead of the January window as they look to provide more depth behind Micky van de Ven. Ben Davies is a cover option currently but out of contract in the summer.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ben Davies and Yves Bissouma.",
      "West Ham's priority in January is signing a No 9, with Niclas Fullkrug likely to depart. AC Milan are progressing in talks to sign the Germany international, who has agreed to the move in principle, and also has interest from Wolfsburg.",
      "They are one of the clubs that are keen on Ivan Toney but it would be a difficult task to get him out of Saudi club Al Ahli due to the high costs of a deal both in terms of transfer fee and wages.",
      "As things stand he is unlikely to sign a new deal at Fulham and West Ham could try to reunite him with Nuno in January in a cut-price deal.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Callum Wilson, Guido Rodriguez and Andrew Irving, George Earthy and Lukasz Fabianski.",
      "Wolves have a delicate balancing act in January given they are highly likely to be relegated this season.",
      "They are aiming to recruit players who can help their fight for Premier League survival but will also be suitable should they go down to the Championship and be seeking promotion.",
      "Wolves will be looking at what is available in the Premier League, especially players who are not featuring regularly and might want to boost their chances of playing in the World Cup by joining them on loan.",
      "They have some sellable assets too but it would not help relations with the fans if they sold the players now. Instead, positions they want to strengthen are at goalkeeper, right wing-back, centre midfield, winger, No 10 and No 9.",
      "Players out of contract at the end of the season: Ki-jana Hoever and Matt Doherty.",
      "The window opens on Thursday January 1, 2026 and closes on Monday February 2, 2026.",
      "Super 6 have made a millionaire already this season, but could you be the next big winner? Enter the next round for free."

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Rayan Cherki's creativity for Man City and how his form changes the Premier League title picture. Plus: Jeremie Frimpong's pace helping Liverpool and Ayden Heaven's growing reputation at Man Utd",
      "Monday 29 December 2025 11:20, UK",
      "It was not until the start of November that Pep Guardiola left Rayan Cherki on the pitch for over an hour of a Premier League game. The player provided two assists that day against Bournemouth and has started eight of the last nine Premier League games.",
      "Manchester City have won all but one of them to reignite their title hopes and Cherki's role in that has been significant. Most obviously, he scored the winner against Nottingham Forest at the weekend. But his assist for the opener was more typical.",
      "Cherki has provided seven Premier League assists since the start of November, more than any other player in the competition in that time. It is more than twice as many as all but two players - Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Fulham's Harry Wilson.",
      "The difference is that while Fernandes and Wilson are the set-piece takers for their respective teams, all seven of Cherki's assists have come from open play. No other Premier League player has more than three assists from open play during this period.",
      "The key for Guardiola has been getting Cherki in possession of the ball in those areas of the pitch where he can cause the most problems for the opposition. At Forest, although many of those touches were on the right, he was able to do damage centrally.",
      "All three of the chances that he created, including for Tijjani Reijnders' goal, came from forward passes from central positions. Since the start of November, no player in the Premier League has completed more through-balls than the France international.",
      "Tellingly, that game against the Cherries was the first time that Guardiola had named Cherki and Phil Foden in the same starting line-up. It is seven wins from eight in all competitions with them together since then, the twin playmakers proving crucial.",
      "Back in October, the best case for City reclaiming the title relied on Erling Haaland bludgeoning opponents and covering up the flaws in this team. Now, something is taking shape. There is more to this City. Cherki's impact highlights that clearly.",
      "Rob Edwards was encouraged by Wolves' start but about a quarter of an hour into their game at Liverpool, it changed. \"Liverpool began to force us back,\" he explained. \"They changed one or two bits and got a lot of numbers high so it was hard for us to get out.\"",
      "It was around that time that Arne Slot could be seen on the touchline urging Jeremie Frimpong to move higher up. In the latter stages of the first half at Anfield, the nominal right-back played right up against Wolves' back line. It brought the breakthrough goal.",
      "\"Last week, he had the assist against Tottenham and today he had a great assist against Wolves,\" said Slot when discussing Frimpong in the press conference afterwards. \"Pace, that is what he has and that is so important and crucial in modern-day football.\"",
      "He explained: \"To create something against a low-block, teams that defend with so many players, usually teams break this down with set-pieces. Now that is not our biggest strength.\" But Frimpong's pace can help them open teams up another way.",
      "He raced past two Wolves players before crossing for Ryan Gravenberch to score. \"Pure individual ability - quick, bam, bam and a cut-back cross. Okay, we were positioned in the right position, but that is the pace I always wanted to bring in in the summer.\"",
      "This was only Frimpong's second Premier League start since his arrival from Bayer Leverkusen, injury hampering his first half-season in a Liverpool shirt. \"Now, if he is fit, he can definitely help us.\" The opening goal in beating Wolves showed precisely why.",
      "A word too for Ayden Heaven, who earned Gary Neville's player of the match award in Manchester United's backs-to-the-wall win over Newcastle on Boxing Day. Heaven produced eight clearances and one vital block to help preserve a precious clean sheet.",
      "Ruben Amorim's switch to a back four was a major talking point but whatever the formation it seems that the teenage defender has forced himself into the plans. It is now five starts in a row since coming in for the first time this season against West Ham.",
      "\"I am really pleased with Ayden. You can feel that he is improving every game. He is young, but you do not feel that he has a good game and then he slows the game or the thinking during the game. No, you feel that he is improving during the game.",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think he was not playing, but he trained really well. You just need to train really well to be ready when the opportunity comes. So in this moment, if he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"",
      "One recalls Hayden being presented to the supporters on the pitch at Old Trafford in February following his signing from Arsenal and there being no great sense that he was someone who would have a significant role to play before the calendar year was out.",
      "United lost that game 2-0 to Crystal Palace with Leny Yoro in the team and now Heaven appears to be ahead of the young Frenchman in Amorim's pecking order. Like Yoro, his progress is unlikely be linear. There will be setbacks. But Heaven's reputation is growing.",

      "Manchester United held on to beat Newcastle 1-0 at Old Trafford to move fifth in the Premier League after claiming their first clean sheet since early October; Ruben Amorim started a Premier League game with a back four for the first time since taking charge",
      "Saturday 27 December 2025 10:17, UK",
      "\"Sometimes you need to adapt and there is no tactic in that moment,\" said Ruben Amorim after Manchester United's 1-0 win over Newcastle. He was responding after acknowledging that he had gone with a back six late in the game.",
      "His patched-up side were holding on with Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot playing ahead of the full-backs in a six-man defence. Of course, the fact that Amorim had been playing a back four at all was a fascination and an indication that his team is evolving tactically.",
      "There was a time when he would not have countenanced such a thing but he feels a little more emboldened now, able to adjust from a position of relative strength having got United up to fifth - and potentially even higher before a difficult 2025 is through.",
      "The reason for that growing confidence owes as much to the togetherness as the results, however, and that is the takeaway from this win as much as the formation. Amorim agreed that, in its own way, it was one of the most satisfying wins in that sense.",
      "\"I think it's something that we need to feel that, that we can win sometimes without playing so well, that we can win games with the spirit and with the togetherness in the team.\" He talked of his young team defending every cross and putting bodies on the line.",
      "\"We were suffering a lot,\" he explained. \"We were just trying to survive.\" He was talking about those final moments against Newcastle but it might just sum up his time at the club so far. They came through it, though. Perhaps Amorim will come through it all too.",
      "Amorim finally changed formation and his back four delivered a first clean sheet in nearly three months. Many will be wondering what took him so long - and rightly so - after more than a year of stubbornly sticking to one shape.",
      "He delivered the surprise with maximum impact by having his players warm up in a back three. It was quite the shock when United lined up at kick-off. This was the first time Amorim had started with a back four.",
      "But it begs the question of why now? This can't have been the first such game.",
      "The change becomes even more curious when you hear Amorim's comments about Dorgu, the goalscorer against Newcastle, and how he benefitted from playing as winger rather than a wing-back.",
      "\"You put him in one position that is more in front, the responsibilities are not the same, and he has more freedom to lose the ball. I think it helped Patrick to play better.\"",
      "Amorim's analysis is inarguable. This was probably Dorgu's best performance in a United shirt. But that in itself and the head coach's acknowledgement of it bring us back to that earlier question.",
      "These are points that onlookers have been making ever since Amorim took the job over a year ago. What might have happened had he listened earlier? It makes you think.",
      "Dorgu's improvement will raise questions about how other, better players might have flourished in a different shape. Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo spring to mind for that position on the right wing. It certainly seems a more natural fit for Amad than wing-back.",
      "But perhaps their return from AFCON will signal an end to the experiment. There has been no clear communication about how long this will last.",
      "After spending so long defending his way there is no telling what Amorim is planning long-term. It would seem almost silly in a way, albeit totally necessary, if he were to go back on his word now and move on from solely playing three at the back.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side finished their 1-0 win over Newcastle with a back four of Lenny Yoro, Ayden Heaven, Tyler Fredricson and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Surely, however, the conclusion for Amorim must be that his previous position of having one shape and sticking to it, regardless of personnel or game state, is a mistake not to be repeated.",
      "There are signs of genuine improvement thanks to Amorim's flexibility. That's what he should stick to.",
      "\"We have seen a big win for Man Utd. To come out and win an ugly game, specifically from a defensive point of view, keeping that clean sheet,\" the former Man Utd captain said.",
      "\"There has to be pride in your defending. An ugly win but a big win.",
      "\"The goal was fantastic, a special goal. But if you want to make progress, it has got to be about being defensively solid. It is a start in terms of momentum for the younger players but you have to find something.",
      "\"Digging out results. The teams I played in, we didn't play well every week but we dug in. They have to kick on now.\"",
      "\"It feels right for Man Utd [the change in shape]. In the last few weeks, we have seen something different.",
      "\"Tonight, with and without the ball, it's a back and midfield four. The strange thing about it, it's forced Newcastle into a back five! They've been really good.\"",
