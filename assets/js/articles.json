      "Manchester United started the summer in fast fashion in a bid to transform their Premier League fortunes. The club moved quickly to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves to begin strengthening Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "The Portuguese coach wants his team in place in time for the pre-season tour of the United States. Amorim wants to integrate new signings across the pond and not be incumbered by stars who have already been deemed surplus to requirements.",
      "United still want to strengthen their forward line and have been linked with a move for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. An out-and-out striker is also required with Viktor Gyokeres among the candidates.",
      "The Red Devils have decided Bournemouth star Antoine Semenyo's price-tag is too prohibitive. The Cherries wanted in the region of £70million for the attacker.",
      "Juventus are willing to offer Dusan Vlahovic to Manchester United in their bid to land Jadon Sancho. The Italians are open to an audacious swap deal as both sides look to offload their unwanted stars.",
      "Napoli have also been credited with an interest in Sancho's services but, per Gazzetta dello Sport, Juve are willing to offer players to United in a bid to get a deal for Sancho over the line. United are hoping to see their finances boosted by the winger's exit, but Vlahovic could help solve United's striker issues.",
      "It is uncertain whether Vlahovic would entertain a move to the Premier League however. The is said to have been 'unreceptive' to previous offers to leave the club despite having just a year remaining on his deal.",
      "Ruben Amorim is hoping to transform his squad for next season but so far has seen limited change in the players at his disposal. The Portuguese coach has decided on a number of players he is happy to part ways with to help facilitate signing the likes of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United are working on a number of high-profile sales, with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho expected to leave. No deal has come too fruition with the latter wearing the former's Aston Villa shirt recently, exits do seem expected.",
      "Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho are all on the chopping block too. United will hope to secure permanent moves for players who were out on loan last term.",
      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP have taken a hit, as Arsenal grow frustrated in negotiations for their alternative. The Gunners have been in talks for Gyokeres and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Chances of the north London side opting for Gyokeres' signature appear to be increasing however. Arsenal are growing frustrated over the contract that Sesko's camp are demanding during talks, while Gyokeres' preferred destination is said to be Arsenal.",
      "Sesko, 22, would cost around £70m which Arsenal are believed to be willing to pay. Contract demands are proving more problematic having exceeded their expectations however."

The 25-year-old is expected to depart permanently before the start of the new season after a switch to Chelsea failed to materialise following a loan stint at Stamford Bridge.",

      "It remains to be seen, though, whether Vlahovic would entertain a move to the Premier League. He is said to have been 'unreceptive' to previous offers to leave the club and snubbed proposals from Saudi Arabia and Turkey.",
      "Vlahovic is no stranger to Premier League links: he was heavily courted by Arsenal before signing for Juve in a £60million deal back in 2021 and has also been the subject of interest from Chelsea in the past.",
      "With United in the market for a new striker and Vlahovic now inside the final 12 months of his contract, a deal which would involve he and Sancho swap clubs could suit all parties.",

      "Luiz, 27, was heavily linked with United back in January and could also appeal in a swap deal given his extensive Premier League experience.",
      "The midfielder is another star who has been targeted by Arsenal in the past, as well as his former club, Manchester City.",

      "Manchester United have been told to make a surprise swoop for Everton striker Beto as a solution to their goalscoring woes. The Red Devils struggled for goals last season and have as a result launched a search for a new striker.",
      "Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres was one of their initial targets but United are facing competition from Premier League rivals Arsenal. And as it stands, Gyokeres appears to prefer a move to the Emirates Stadium in any case.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side have now been told to look elsewhere, specifically on Merseyside. Fernando Lopes, president of Portuguese club Uniao Tires, has suggested that Beto - who used to play for his side - would be an ideal addition.",
      "As quoted by The Sun, Lopes said: \"Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting, but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal.",
      "\"Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it's quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as the lone No. 9 waiting for service. Beto's a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn't lose duels. He's a real headache for opponents - if he gets the service.",
      "\"In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces, but haven't had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there's an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "\"Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate, plus he's very fast. When [David] Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he's for defenders to stop. He'd be like Amorim's ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.\"",
      "Beto, 27, joined Everton from Italian side Udinese in 2023 for £25m but endured a poor start to life in the Premier League with just three goals across his debut season. But he improved last term having scored 10 goals across all competitions.",
      "Beto is not the only surprise forward that United have been linked with this summer. Former Tottenham star Jamie O’Hara recently suggested that Jamie Vardy would be an ideal addition following his exit from Leicester.",
      "He said: “If you’re a team coming up you’d definitely have a look at him. But I think he can still do a job at an established Premier League club. Couldn’t he do a job at Man United? How many goals has [Rasmus] Hojlund got?",
      "“You can’t tell me he still can’t do a job in the Premier League. As a free transfer, I think he’s a great signing to add to your squad.”",
      "United have already added Wolves star Matheus Cunha to their squad after paying £62.5m for the ex-Wolves forward. Bryan Mbeumo is also on their shortlist but face competition for the Brentford star from Tottenham.",

      "United were hoping to pay for Mbeumo in instalments but were hit by a setback after Brentford told them they wanted the bulk of the fee paid up front.",

      "The forward has already made his first two appearances for the club against Los Angeles FC and Flamengo and is hoping to become Chelsea's first choice forward in the 2025-26 season.",
      "Delap has spoken about what influenced his decision to move to Stamford Bridge despite huge interest in his signature and said Palmer - who came through the ranks with him at Manchester City - was a big help in making his decision.",
      "\"Yeah I spoke to him a little bit,\" he said, as reported by ESPN. \"Asked him what I needed to ask him. He told me what I needed to know. I don't like too much information.",
      "\"Ultimately it was my decision so I kind of just want my head to be clear so not too much. [I've known him] since I was 15, playing at City with him. I've got a good relationship with him so it was nice to see a familiar face.",
      "\"There are so many factors that go into it. I've got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before. I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "Palmer made the move from City to Chelsea and has become one of the first names on the team-sheet. He scored 22 goals and assisted 11 in his first season before netting another 15 and assisting eight in his second campaign.",
      "Delap is hoping to emulate the midfielder by also making a fast start to life in west London, having scored 12 Premier League goals last season.",
      "\"Of course, that's the goal,\" Delap said. \"I think we both had similar positions and he's gone and smashed it so hopefully I can also.",

      "Delap is still only 22 and will now be looking to stamp his mark on the Premier League after his first season in the top flight with the Tractor Boys ended in relegation. He previously played six senior games for City before loan moves to Stoke, Preston and Hull before joining Ipswich for £20m last summer.",

      "They have already splashed £62.5m on former Wolves forward and Brazilian international Matheus Cunha. It is hoped that he could be the first attacking addition of the summer as Amorim attempts to solve his side’s goalscoring woes.",
      "And United already have their eyes on a few more. With that being said, take a look at what the starting XI could look like against Arsenal on the opening day of next season:",
      "Let’s start in the obvious place - in goal. There could potentially be a change ahead of next season. Andre Onana has failed to convince since his arrival from Inter Milan, with Monaco eyeing a swoop for the Cameroonian.",
      "And should he be allowed to leave, United could move for Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma, who sees his contract expire in a year. He has already reportedly been discussing a move to the Premier League with his Italian colleagues.",
      "While United committed to a significant outlay last term in signing Leny Yoro, Patrick Dorgu and Matthijs de Ligt to bolster their defence, there could yet be more signings. Youngster Diego Leon is on the way, while it has been reported that Sporting Lisbon star Ousmane Diomande is keen on being reunited with Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Who else should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "And United could potentially do with another defender following the exits of Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof. Should Diomande be signed, he could potentially replace Lisandro Martinez in the heart of the defence, with the Argentine expected to be sidelined until September. Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui should retain their positions as wing-backs in Amorim’s system.",
      "Moving into midfield, the Red Devils’ line-up seems pretty well set. Last summer’s signing Manuel Ugarte should do enough to usurp Casemiro, while captain Bruno Fernandes is a near guarantee to start after spurning interest from Saudi Arabia. Given Christian Eriksen has departed, another signing in midfield might be useful but not crucial.",
      "It’s really in attack where United will go through a real transformation. A number of forwards are already on the chopping block with loanees Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all expected to leave permanently. They could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund, who have both been linked with moves to Italy.",
      "Of course, a deal for Matheus Cunha is already over the line and he could soon be followed by Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford star is United’s next attacking target and he is already keen on a move to Old Trafford despite late competition from Tottenham.",

      "In the social media photograph that has wound up many a Manchester United fan, it is definitely a surprise to see Alejandro Garnacho wearing an Aston Villa jersey as leisure wear. Normally, it is strictly Louis Vuitton gear, the top-and-shorts number in another holiday snap retailing at a couple of grand.",
      "And in the shot which features Garnacho in a replica Rashford shirt that seems to have offended many, the United player is flanked by two cars. According to a couple of petrol-head mates, one appears to be a Ferrari Portofino and the other a Lamborghini Urus.",
      "Whatever the models, one thing is for sure, there’s a good half a million pounds worth of motor there. Professional footballers enjoying and showing the conspicuous rewards of considerable wealth is hardly exceptional. It is commonplace.",
      "And no-one should be overly bothered - or bothered at all - by displays of material trappings. In fact, there seems to be some degree of fascination in what rich men and women do with their money.",
      "But, rightly or wrongly, the reason why the picture of Garnacho in a Villa-Rashford shirt with a pair of super-cars might jar is that it comes across as a portrait of a superstar who was anything other than a superstar last season. Garnacho was not United’s worst player, far from it.",
      "And for what it is worth, Ruben Amorim’s decision not to start him in the Europa League final was not a good one. But Garnacho scored six goals and made two assists in 36 appearances in the Premier League last season.",
      "He has eight goals in his last 51 Premier League appearances. There is, without any doubt, a very talented player in Garnacho, as was spectacularly demonstrated by THAT goal at Goodison Park.",
      "But that was in November, 2023, in the early months of a new five-year deal and if Garnacho was a United player rewarded too handsomely too quickly, that would not be unusual. Garnacho wearing a Villa shirt and then publishing the photograph seems a bit silly, more an error of judgement rather than a heinous crime.",
      "Don’t forget, this is a player who, apparently, has been told to find another club. As cool as he looks, prospective suitors might not be overly impressed with Garnacho’s social media picture gallery.",
      "There will be no public admonishment of Garnacho from United as that would probably be counter-productive. If they really do want to sell, they will want top dollar for a young player who still has buckets of potential.",
      "The last thing United will want to do is exacerbate any idea that Garnacho is a wrong ‘un. And when minor incidents such as this cause brief consternation amongst United fans, the club probably knows that it is partly responsible.",

      "The striker only scored four goals in 37 appearances for Everton, resulting in him rejoining Juventus on a permanent basis in 2023 after an initial two-year loan. Now at Fiorentina, Kean has finally put his Goodison Park woes behind him and rekindled his career.",
      "Fiorentina paid just £11m for the Italian in what's proven to be a bargain transfer deal. Kean, 26, finished his first season playing for La Viola with 25 goals in 44 appearances.",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain loanee helped Fiorentina reach the Conference League semi-finals and qualify for Europe by finishing sixth in Serie A. His prolific form has prompted links of a move to United, who are looking for a new striker.",
      "In good news for Ruben Amorim, Kean has a release clause of £44.5m which is active between July 1 and 15. Although paying the fee is cut and dry, convincing the 26-year-old to return to England after a troublesome time on and off the pitch could be difficult.",
      "During an interview with the Athletic last season, Kean revealed how much he disliked the weather in the north west of England. \"They were so used to not seeing the sun, they were barbecuing on the beach in winter,\" the Juventus academy product recalled.",
      "\"They were in short sleeves in winter. I said to myself: 'These people are out of their minds'.\"",
      "Kean is still grateful for the experience, adding: \"England made me learn a lot about myself. I matured a lot. When I got there I didn't play much. I used to think, 'How am I not getting into this team, at Everton?\"",
      "\"Mentally, it made me evolve. I wasn't playing and it was in dark times that I knew I had to grit my teeth and train even more. Then the chance to go to PSG came along, I moved there and got everything out of myself that I could. I wasn't playing at Everton and I knew I had to give triple, that’s how it went.\"",
      "United aren't the only club to have been linked with Kean, who's under contract at Fiorentina until 2029. Saudi Arabian side Al-Qadsiah are said to also be interested, with his release active for the first 15 days of July every year."

      "Manchester United remain in the hunt for Bryan Mbeumo but Brentford's transfer demands could complicate matters - with Tottenham waiting in the wings. The north Londoners have joined the race after hiring Thomas Frank.",
      "Mbeumo has just enjoyed his best season to date, scoring 20 times for the Bees, and that has seen interest in him mount. United are in the market for more firepower this summer but saw their opening offer worth £45million plus £10m in add-ons at the start of June rejected.",
      "United are preparing a fresh offer for the Cameroon star but Brentford have made it clear that they want the bulk of Mbeumo's fee to be paid up front, reports the Evening Standard. They do not want to sanction his exit based on a number of instalments over several years.",
      "That could hamper the plans at Old Trafford with the Red Devils hoping to pay for Mbeumo gradually if they were successful with a bid. Brentford want a fee similar to the one the £62.5m that saw Matheus Cunha join United from Wolves only weeks ago.",
      "Even those negotiations caused problems for the Manchester outfit, who must remain compliant with financial rules. They wanted to pay for Cunha over five years before eventually meeting Wolves' terms of three instalments over two seasons.",
      "It all opens the door for Tottenham who beat United in the Europa League final last month and can now offer Champions League football, as they look for a new winger. Mbeumo has been identified as a target as is remains open to joining Tottenham, although a switch to Manchester is thought to be his preference. Tottenham have also lined up Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo as a possible target.",
      "Brentford are more than happy for a bidding war to commence as they look to maximise their profit on a player they signed as an unknown quantity back when they were in the Championship.",
      "Frank was the man who brought Mbeumo to England as a teenager in 2019 and the pair enjoy a close relationship having been part of the journey that took Brentford from the Championship to the Premier League before consolidating them as a top flight side across the following four seasons.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants to address several areas of his squad this summer but Cunha is the only man to arrive through the door. Liam Delap was a target but the striker opted to move to Chelsea instead. The Red Devils could yet pursue Viktor Gyokeres, who worked under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon.",

      "A potential swap deal that would see Manchester United part ways with Jadon Sancho and welcome Dusan Vlahovic could be on the cards.",
      "The Englishman is expected to be sold this summer after spending the entirety of last season on loan to Chelsea, where he won the UEFA Conference League. Sancho's last game so far for the Red Devils came in the Community Shield last year, with his likely sale putting an end to what has been a hugely disappointing period for both parties.",
      "Among the possibilities of his possible departure is the 25-year-old leaving English football to join Juventus in exchange for the Serbian striker. Vlahovic, who was a prior target for Arsenal, has largely played a bench role at the Italian giants since the loan arrival of Randal Kolo-Muani in January.",
      "Reports in Italy have said that the club are proposing to offer the striker - who has a year left on his contract - in order to capture Sancho, who has 'not let go' of the winger since first registering interest in signing him last year, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "While Vlahovic has maintained a respectable goal-scoring record of 57 goals in 144 games, the 25-year-old has failed to replicate the devastating form in front of goal that he showed during his time at Fiorentina.",
      "He did score 16 goals across all competitions this season, which is just one less than Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee managed combined. On top of his superiority as a scorer ahead of their forward options, the Premier League giants will certainly be buoyed by reports from Corriere dello Sport that Vlahovic turned down a mammoth offer worth £17million a year from Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr earlier this year.",
      "Not yet in his prime, the decision to remain in a top European league will come as a positive sign to United chiefs about the desire the Serb has to accomplish honours at the highest level rather than taking a cash grab.",
      "A player devoted to his club and team-mates is certainly a sought-after attribute and it's one Vlahovic displayed last season during a trying time for Juventus.",
      "After a fourth consecutive Serie A draw where his side could only muster up a 2-2 draw against Venezia, the Juve players, as per tradition, walked over to the fans under the Curva to thank them for their support.",
      "However, the feeling wasn't mutual. The supporters hurled insults and disrespectful chants at the players, which Vlahovic didn't take too kindly to as he shouted back at the fans. According to Sky Sport Italia, despite the players walking away, the fans continued with the insults, which prompted the striker to turn to them and gesture a sarcastic thumbs-up at them.",
      "While it's never healthy for a player to argue with their own fans, it shows United that Vlahovic isn't afraid to speak his mind and will stand up for his teammates when he feels it is necessary.",
      "Adding such a strong personality to the dressing room could have both positive and negative effects, and Ruben Amorim will no doubt be taking a lot of different factors into consideration as he continues his search for more reinforcements this summer, including a new striker.",
      "Amorim has so far overseen the arrival of one new signing this summer in Matheus Cunha, who they bought for £62.5m from Wolves. While interest remains in Bryan Mbeumo and Viktor Gyokeres, United are said to face competition for the attackers from Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal, respectively.",

      "Manchester United have dramatically reduced the size of their scouting network in a bid to put an end to years of bad transfer business. The Red Devils have spent an astonishing £1.6billion on players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, the last time they won the Premier League title.",
      "Poor recruitment has been a factor in United's demise and the new regime at Old Trafford have acknowledged the club's costly mistakes. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, 38, will lead a more streamlined scouting network, having joined in February last year.",
      "Vivell, who previously worked at RB Leipzig before a brief spell with Chelsea, initially arrived at United on a temporary basis, helping them navigate the 2024 summer transfer window. It was their summer first since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became a co-owner, taking control of football operations.",
      "German Vivell's work behind the scenes has earned him plaudits at Old Trafford and the hierarchy trust him to improve their recruitment record. That starts with a new-look scouting network.",
      "A 10-man team comprising of Armand Benneker, Marco de Sisti, Roy Beukenkamp, Giuseppe Antonaccio, Ben McFarlan, Jose Mayorga, John Lambert, Norbert Duwel, Steve Head and Nicolas Cinalli are listed as first-team scouts. They'll report to Vivell, with Ratcliffe and his fellow bigwigs expecting results.",
      "The Red Devils co-owner claimed last year that United were 'still in the last century on data analysis', a damning indictment on the previous regime led by Ed Woodward. \"The club has drifted for a long period of time, a decade or so,\" Ratcliffe lamented in an interview with the fanzine United We Stand.",
      "\"Manchester United has become mediocre. It's not elite and it is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. That's what it used to be under Alex. There is major change to come to achieve elite status. But already there has been huge change at this club.",
      "\"Until were are as good as anyone in the world, then it's not good enough for Manchester United. We must have the best recruitment in the world.",
      "Who should Manchester United sign this summer? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "\"Data analysis comes alongside recruitment. It doesn't really exist here. We're still in the last century on data analysis here. There's immense amount of useful data that we can get from data analysis and we're in the 'very poor' bracket with data analysis here.",
      "\"These things don't happen overnight. You can't just flick a light switch and sort out recruitment. It's all about people and we need to find the right people.\"",
      "Michael Sansoni, an engineer for Mercedes' Formula 1 team, has reportedly been lined up to join United at the end of this year. Given that Ratcliffe's petrochemicals company, INEOS, own a stake in Mercedes F1, the process should be smooth and would be supported internally."

      "The 20-year-old's brother accused Amorim of throwing Garnacho under the bus, having been benched last month's 1-0 dismal loss to Tottenham in Bilbao. It emerged shortly after that Amorim had ruthlessly told Garnacho to find a new club, with Napoli, Juventus, AC Milan and Atletico Madrid - his former club - all reportedly interested.",

      "The ex-Borussia Dortmund star struggled on loan at Chelsea, who've even paid the Red Devils £5m NOT to sign him permanently. Dortmund have been keeping tabs on Sancho, who's yet to work with Amorim, and he's also been tipped for a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was also sent out on loan midway through the season, although Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven haven't taken up the option to sign him permanently. The left-back is expected to have other suitors, however, as Benfica were close to signing him in January, only for the move to break down.",
      "United would be willing to listen to offers for every member of their squad, with some valued much more by Amorim than others. Players such as Leny Yoro, Bruno Fernandes and Amad are considered prized possessions while they're reluctant to sell a striker, likely Rasmus Hojlund, before bringing in a replacement, as the Red Devils continue to be linked with Viktor Gyokeres."

The Red Devils have struggled to maintain consistent success since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, but it's not for want of effort.",
      "Without a Premier League title since the 2012/13 season, the club has been on the hunt for that elusive 21st league victory, splashing out colossal sums of money in the process. After cycling through managers like David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho, United entrusted the reins to club icon Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "He made a splash in his first full season, shelling out over £200million on Daniel James, Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Bruno Fernandes. However, it's the five-year period from the summer of 2020 that has seen the club - who've spent over £400m during this time - experience a historic plummet, culminating in their 15th-placed finish last season, their worst league position since the 1973/74 season.",
      "Solskjaer approved the signings of Donny van de Beek, Alex Telles, and Facundo Pellistri in 2020. Van de Beek cost £35m and only played 62 matches for the club before departing for an initial fee of just £423,000 (€500,000).",
      "In his final and most significant transfer window at the club, the Norwegian legend brought Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford, splashed out £34million on World Cup champion Raphael Varane, and forked out a staggering £73m for Jadon Sancho. The Englishman arrived with a glowing reputation from his stint at Borussia Dortmund but failed to replicate his German form.",
      "Sancho, 25, eventually fell out of favour with Solskjaer's successor, Erik ten Hag, who relegated him from the first-team in the 2023/24 season. He was subsequently loaned out to Chelsea last season after being deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim and is expected to leave the club once again.",
      "Like Solskjaer, Ten Hag received strong backing in the transfer market as he raided the Eredivisie, signing Tyrell Malacia for £13m and Lisandro Martinez for £46m from his former club Ajax. He also made Antony the second-most expensive player in United's history, spending £81m to secure him.",
      "The Brazilian may have had a promising start, scoring three goals in his first three games, but he managed just nine more goals in his next 93 games, earning him the dishonour of being one of the worst signings in Premier League history.",

      "The big-money signings of Mason Mount (£55m), Andre Onana (£43m) and Rasmus Hojlund (£64m) have all failed to hit the mark, with the striker and goalkeeping positions expected to be bolstered this summer.",
      "Despite United actively searching the managerial market to potentially replace Ten Hag following his FA Cup final victory over Manchester City, he remained at the helm as he once again splashed the cash.",
      "Among the likes of Matthijs De Ligt, Manuel Ugarte, and Leny Yoro, it was the £36m spent on Joshua Zirkzee that left fans feeling deflated after a disappointing debut season at Old Trafford. The forward netted a paltry seven goals, with just three of them coming in the Premier League.",
      "There are several areas Amorim is looking to strengthen and he has filled one void so far after signing Matheus Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves earlier this month. The Portuguese boss is also a huge fan of Bryan Mbeumo and Viktor Gyokeres as he looks to address United's goal-scoring woes.",
      "A replacement for Onana could be in the pipeline this summer in what could turn out to be the most crucial summer in United's recent history - or just another huge dump of money after seeing in excess of £400m go down the drain.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "And the Reds are also keen on Crystal Palace star Marc Guehi, but they have Arsenal for company. While Jarell Quansah could depart the club.",
      "The Gunners are pushing for Benjamin Sesko as they eye a new frontman, but the RB Leipzig star's demands could still scupper the deal. Perhaps a move for Viktor Gyokeres is not yet off the table however. Confirmation of Martin Zubimendi's transfer may not happen until next month.",
      "Manchester United are also in the market for a forward having already added Matheus Cunha. But exits will equally be on Ruben Amorim's mind.",
      "United have yet to part ways with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony or Alejandro Garnacho. And the club may need the financial boost with significant prices quoted for the likes of Gyokeres and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "This would be a stunning deal if it was officially confirmed, but the Telegraph is reporting that Manchester United and Chelsea are considering sending Alejandro Garnacho and Christopher Nkunku in opposite directions.",
      "Both players face uncertain futures after difficult seasons saw Nkunku fall down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, while Garnacho fell out with his manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "While a direct swap deal is unlikely, the two clubs are considering separate transfers that would \"solve a headache\" this summer.",
      "With Arsenal becoming frustrated in their bid to sign Red Bull Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, it has been reported the Gunners are lining up an alternative.",

      "Delap insists he ultimately had the final say but said Manchester City youth team-mate Palmer \"told him what I needed to know\".",
      "\"Yeah I spoke to him a little bit,\" he said. \"Asked him what I needed to ask him. He told me what I needed to know. I don't like too much information. Ultimately it was my decision so I kind of just want my head to be clear so not too much. [I've known him] since I was 15, playing at City with him. I've got a good relationship with him so it was nice to see a familiar face.",
      "\"There are so many factors that go into it. I've got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before. I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "We reported earlier that Liverpool's Phillips was on his way to the Hawthorns to link up with new boss Ryan Mason and now that move has been officially confirmed.",

      "The report claims that Brentford did speak to \"a number of high profile managers\" but have opted for Andrews because he knows their systems and believe he can become a \"top head coach\".",

      "Mbeumo has just enjoyed his best season to date, scoring 20 times for the Bees, and that has seen interest in him mount. United are in the market for more firepower this summer but saw their opening offer worth £45million plus £10m in add-ons at the start of June rejected.",
      "United are preparing a fresh offer for the Cameroon star but Brentford have made it clear that they want the bulk of Mbeumo's fee to be paid up front, reports the Evening Standard. They do not want to sanction his exit based on a number of instalments over several years.",

      "Among the possibilities of his possible departure is the 25-year-old leaving English football to join Juventus in exchange for the Serbian striker. Vlahovic, who was a prior target for Arsenal, has largely played a bench role at the Italian giants since the loan arrival of Randal Kolo-Muani in January.",
      "Reports in Italy have said that the club are proposing to offer the striker - who has a year left on his contract - in order to capture Sancho, who has 'not let go' of the winger since first registering interest in signing him last year, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport.",

      "A handful of other League Two clubs were also in for Pressley, who will move for an undisclosed fee.",
      "Aaron Ramsdale has emerged as a target for Galatasaray, with Arsenal set to profit from any deal for the Southampton star. The goalkeeper has a £20m release clause and the Turkish side, home to a number of ex-Premier League players, could yet tempt the shotstopper.",

      "And Garnacho's social media activity appears to have signalled some camaraderie with Rashford, to the dismay of some United fans. Sharing photographs from his holiday to Ibiza, one included a picture of him wearing Marcus Rashford's Aston Villa shirt.",
      "Rashford responded to the post with the words 'My brother' and a heart emoji. Others of a United persuasion were less kind, however.",

      "The other giveaway is Rashford's use of the word \"brother\" in the comments. It is the most hollow and meaningless noun in football. Rashford and Garnacho have only ever socialised during team-bonding dinners.",
      "Garnacho and Rashford rarely linked up on the pitch, never mind off it. Garnacho pinched Rashford's place on the left wing. One of Rashford's inner circle dubbed him a \"f*****g Ronaldo wannabe\". Now they are \"brothers\".",
      "In all probability, neither player literally posted or commented. Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, accidentally sent a tweet intended for Rashford's Twitter account from the DN May Sports agency he runs in September 2021. Having interviewed Rashford, a thoughtful talker, his often banal captions never sound like something he would ever say.",
      "Maynard was summoned to United's Carrington training complex after Rashford's Belfast bender in January 2024. They know their race is run at United but it is still unedifying to see a player who joined the club's academy 20 years ago publicly stoop to such a petty low.",
      "Garnacho's own advisers, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, have succeeded and failed with the Argentine. They have a client whose value was listed in excess of £100m last year but literally leave Garnacho to his own (smartphone) devices.",
      "He is a loose cannon, regularly sounding off on social media, and failing to gag his lippy brother. Cambeiro and De Lucas are part of the problem. They let the world know they were at Stamford Bridge in January, when Chelsea were giving serious consideration to bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho turns 21 next week yet acts like the finished article. He is finished at United and, in his desperation, has found an ally in Rashford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both lucratively remunerated in 2023. Garnacho kicked on. It kicked off with Rashford. They had little in common other than their position until they irked Amorim in Plzen back in December.",
      "They were close on the morning of December 15, when both were training at Carrington having been dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby. Garnacho, to his credit, went in one direction and played in every remaining match last season bar the final day win over Villa. Rashford decided on a change of scenery.",
      "It is particularly sobering for United that the two upstarts are academy products that represent the best of both worlds. The local lad and the gem unearthed from abroad.",
      "Some in the United academy can be quick to pat themselves on the back when there is a history of some of their most talented products posing problems, from the frivolous to the serious. The academy cannot parent a player throughout their career or be held completely accountable, but it is cause to take stock.",
      "The brazenness of Garnacho's post and Rashford's comment is a throwback to Paul Pogba - another academy graduate - revelling in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter with his 'Caption this' post. Pogba was never disciplined over that.",
      "United resisted selling Pogba, tolerated the late Mino Raiola declaring \"it's over\" for him on the eve of a decisive Champions League tie at RB Leipzig (that United lost) and released him. The Stretford End repeatedly chanted \"F**k off, Pogba\" after he was substituted against Norwich City in April 2022. He did. Pogba never played at Old Trafford again.",
      "Neither, most likely, will Rashford and Garnacho."

      "Manchester United have streamlined their scouting system to ten first-team scouts.",
      "Christopher Vivell, the director of recruitment, has been empowered to oversee United's recruitment network since he arrived at the club last year.",
      "Vivell joined United last year, initially on a temporary basis, and helped oversee recruitment in the club's first summer since Sir Jim Ratcliffe became a minority shareholder in February 2024.",
      "United's scouting network was once so bloated it was in excess of 100 scouts but dozens have left the club across the two rounds of redundancies over the past 12 months.",
      "Armand Benneker, Marco de Sisti, Roy Beukenkamp, Giuseppe Antonaccio, Ben McFarlan (technical), Jose Mayorga, John Lambert, Norbert Düwel, Steve Head and Nicolas Cinalli are all still listed as United-employed first team scouts.",
      "United sources say they want Vivell to take ownership of the reduced scouting network after years of poor business in the transfer market.",
      "The strategy follows the trend of several clubs scaling back their in-person scouting network in favour of recruitment analysts. Brighton, widely acclaimed for their recruitment strategy, let go of the majority of their scouts last year due to their dependence on a bespoke data model that owner Tony Bloom relies on.",
      "Ratcliffe last season lamented that United are \"still in the last century on data analysis\". Former football director John Murtough championed a data-led approach to recruitment and hired Dominic Jordan as the head of data science. Both left within five months of the confirmation of Ratcliffe's stakeholding.",
      "Vivell, 38, previously worked at RB Leipzig and Chelsea, where he was the technical director for only six months."

      "A move for a striker is expected to follow once the Mbeumo deal is completed, but there has also been speculation about United potentially replacing Andre Onana in goal. Reports claim AS Monaco have offered the United No.1 a way out of Old Trafford, with Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez identified as a possible replacement.",
      "In the past 24 hours, several updates have emerged about the futures of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona appears to be off, with Nico Williams now set to join the Nou Camp. Meanwhile, clubs in Italy are reportedly preparing bids for Sancho.",

      "Villa want around £60m for the England international and need to raise funds this summer to ease their PSR concerns.",
      "AS Monaco have made 'concrete contact' with Torino goalkeeper and Man United target Vanja Milinković-Savić.",
      "According to Santi Aouna, the Ligue 1 side are keen on triggering his €20m release clause. United's Andre Onana has also been linked with a move to France.",
      "The updates are coming at us tonight and here's one that could develop into something.",

      "The news that you have all been waiting for.",
      "Man United have reportedly made a new and improved bid for Bryan Mbuemo understood to be worth over £60m. Ben Jacobs and Alex Crook have reported the news and have claimed that talks have accelerated in the past few days.",
      "Fenerbahce have reportedly reached out to Manchester United regarding the conditions to sign Jadon Sancho.",

      "After being unsuccessful with a £55m bid including add-ons, United are expected to make another offer. However, the Evening Standard have reported that the Bees want the majority of the fee paid upfront rather than it being a payment plan over several years.",
      "A name that continues to be mentioned in United's hunt for a new attacker is Christopher Nkunku.",
      "L'Equipe journalist Loic Tanzi has reported that United have opened initial talks with Chelsea to sign Nkunku, who is under contract until 2029. It's said they contacted the entourage in recent days to discuss a possivle transfer.",
      "Unfortunately, it's not the news you were hoping for regarding Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Man United have been handed an inadvertent boost in their mooted pursuit for Emi Martinez.",
      "Speculation around the Aston Villa goalkeeper and his future remains at fever pitch this summer. Several reports have underlined Martinez, 32, as a potential replacement for Andre Onana.",
      "Earmarked as a potential target for United this summer, he's also thought to have admirers in Saudi Arabia with a lucrative move to the Gulf state on the cards. A transfer fee around £30-40 million has been suggested. Martinez himself is said to be \"open\" to a move to Old Trafford. And now United have seemingly been advised on why they might have the advantage in any transfer battle.",
      "Sean Dyche admitted he tried to sign Gyokeres before the striker joined Sporting CP in 2023.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"That boy, Gyokeres... I have to be honest and admit that he is a great player. I saw him play in the Championship for Coventry and then we managed to play a pre-season game with Sporting and I immediately thought to myself that he was a very strong striker.",
      "\"I say this and it's not because of the goals he scores, because his game is much more than that. I tried to sign him before he joined Sporting but his value only went up.\"",
      "And then there were four. Through just a couple of taps of his smart phone, Alejandro Garnacho has joined Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony on Manchester United's list of priority sales.",
      "Garnacho, through his talent and undoubted potential, still had a case for staying in the eyes of some. However, whereas United were previously prepared to offload him for the right price, they now need to ensure they get him off the books this summer alongside Rashford, Sancho and Antony come what may.",
      "Amorim is attempting to oversee the birth of a new dawn at Old Trafford and he cannot waste time dealing with the fallout and noise generated from social media posts that purposely attempt to stir the pot.",
      "They are unnecessary and avoidable. Garnacho has just become the fourth member of a three-man wantaway list.",
      "Chelsea striker Liam Delap has said the Londoners' project was what convinced him to seal a £30million move to Stamford Bridge earlier this month.",
      "Delap became available via a £30m release clause that was triggered following Ipswich's immediate relegation back to the Championship. He joined the Tractor Boys from Manchester City as last July.",
      "\"It was a nice position to be in, but also there are a lot of decisions you have to make,\" said Delap. \"You never know if it is going to be the right decision. You've just got to go with your gut and hopefully it works out. There are so many factors that go into it.",
      "\"I’ve got a good relationship with the manager. I know how he plays. I've played in this system before. I know a lot of the players here and the project of the club, how they see the future. That's what excited me.\"",
      "According to sources, Garnacho has told friends at Man United that Argentina would prefer him to move to a more competitive league ahead of next year’s World Cup in the USA, Canada, and Mexico - reports The Mirror.",
      "While the wages in Saudi Arabia are tempting, the 20-year-old is reluctant to risk his chances of making the World Cup squad.",
      "Argentina are said to favour a move to another Premier League club, or potentially to Spain or Italy.",
      "Man United are expected to be busy in the summer transfer market - both in terms of incomings and outgoings.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side now know they will kick off their Premier League campaign at home to Arsenal but the squad as it is now will look very different come August 17.",
      "United will hope to blood some new signings against the Gunners but there will be a number of departures this summer, too.",

      "Juventus are reportedly willing to offer Dusan Vlahovic to Man United as part of a potential swap deal for Jadon Sancho.",
      "However, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Juventus remain in the race and have ‘not let go’ of Sancho since first expressing interest in the England international over a year ago.",
      "It’s claimed that the 'direct link has never been broken' between Sancho’s camp and Juventus, with the attacker reportedly willing to accept a pay cut to facilitate a move to Turin, where he would have a chance to revive his faltering career.",
      "Sancho is said to view the Juventus shirt as 'prestigious' and discussions between Juventus and United continue through multiple intermediaries. The report indicates that both clubs might even explore a swap deal involving Sancho and Vlahovic.",
      "However, Vlahovic has been reluctant to leave Juventus so far, amid interest from clubs in Turkey and the Saudi Pro League.",
      "With Viktor Gyokeres keen to join Arsenal, Man United's focus has shifted elsewhere and onto Ekitike.",
      "However, they are not alone in their pursuit of the Eintracht Frankfurt's man. And Fabrizio Romano has issued an update.",
      "\"Hugo Ekitike remains a candidate for Liverpool striker position, a player they appreciate, and I keep repeating to you that they are in contact with the agents of the players,\" he said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"It’s going to be, for sure, an interesting story to follow in this summer transfer window.\"",
      "In addition to United, Chelsea have also been credited with an interest in Ekitike.",
      "Louis Saha has urged Man United not to perform a U-turn or shift their focus to alternative targets despite Brentford's firm stance on Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The two clubs have yet to reach an agreement, fuelling speculation that the Reds may explore other options.",
      "\"It is a difficult one. It is a lot of money to consider. I'm sure Mbeumo has no say in the £60m price tag,\" Saha told Express Sport with BetSelect.",
      "\"But if he can put pressure on his agent [to seal a deal], if he's that type of player, then I'd say please sign him, even for £60m. Because we want players, whatever the price, who want to sacrifice, who want to play for United, who want to play for the badge, not because he's got a bigger salary.",
      "\"I don't want any player who comes with an ego, claiming they are the stars or here to be the saviour. I'm looking for someone humble who is willing to make sacrifices.\"",
      "Former Man United boss Jose Mourinho has given the green light for Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho’s move as Fenerbahçe gear up for a crucial summer transfer window.",
      "According to transfer journalist Yagiz Sabuncuoglu, the Turkish club has already initiated talks with United regarding a potential deal.",
      "He cost Man United £73m in July 2021.",
      "AS Monaco are close to signing the former Manchester United midfielder.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, final details are being sorted. Pogba is expected to sign a two-year contract with the French side.",
      "Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell are reportedly working closely with Ruben Amorim to bring in a new number 9 for Man United.",
      "Journalist Graeme Bailey claims that several names feature on their list, including Viktor Gyokeres and Jean-Philippe Mateta. However, they are also said to like Moise Kean, Tammy Abraham and Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "Man United have been urged to make a surprise summer by bringing in Everton’s ‘physical’ Beto.",
      "Fernando Lopes, the president of Portuguese club Uniao Tires, where Beto started his career, said: \"Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting – but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal. Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it is quicker and more competitive.",
      "\"Gyokeres would struggle to play as a lone No. 9 waiting for service. Beto’s a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn’t lose duels.",
      "\"He is a real headache for opponents – if he gets the service. In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces but haven’t had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there is an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "\"Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate – plus he is very fast. When [David] Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he is for defenders to stop. He’d be like Amorim’s ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.\"",
      "According to Defensa Central, Man United have one eye on Real Madrid and Ukraine international goalkeeper Andriy Lunin should a deal for Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez not go through.",
      "The Spanish news outlet has reported that while Martinez is a favourite among the United chiefs, the Argentine has offers from Saudi Arabia that are triple what he could get at Old Trafford.",
      "That has led to United looking at a potential alternative - with a swoop for Lunin explored. The Reds have \"made enquiries\" with Lunin's agent Jorge Mendes about a potential deal for the 26-year-old.",
      "Corriere dello Sport reports that a move for Jadon Sancho hinges on whether Juventus can secure Francisco Conceicao from FC Porto.",
      "Conceicao impressed during his loan spell at Juventus last season, and the club is eager to make the deal permanent.",
      "However, Conceicao’s €30million release clause could prove a significant obstacle for Juve. If Juventus fails to reach an agreement with Porto, a move for Sancho may still be possible.",
      "Tutto Juve reports that Man United have enquired Paris Saint-Germain about the terms of a deal.",
      "Although the striker has expressed his eagerness to make a permanent move to Juventus - after spending last season on loan with the Italian club - the race for his signature remains wide open.",
      "The report adds: \"It’s not just Chelsea on Randal Kolo Muani (26). For the French striker, according to rumors collected by Tuttojuve.com, Manchester United and Newcastle United have also asked for information.",
      "^Nothing concrete yet, there is only an inquiry by the English clubs. Juventus, for its part, hopes to buy him outright and will speak with PSG at the end of the Club World Cup.",

      "Manchester United are heading into July, a month which could make-or-break their next 10 months, with a good deal of business still to complete.",
      "Ruben Amorim has already managed to add Matheus Cunha to his 2025/2026 squad planner and the Portuguese will be hoping to welcome Bryan Mbeumo to Carrington when pre-season starts in July.",
      "However, a move for the Brentford star has stalled, in recent weeks, and their pursuit of a centre-forward has also failed to gather pace. After recording their worst season in 51 years, United are on a mission to return to their peak.",
      "July means a new financial accounting period - and that usually comes with a flurry of transfer business. Two more attacking reinforcements are anticipated before the window shuts, ideally before Amorim and his players jet off to the United States, as well.",
      "They are relatively limited in what they can do in the market until they generate funds from player sales. Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho appear to be the two closest to securing exits, with Marcus Rashford and Antony also tipped to leave.",
      "Cunha is one part of three on United's attacking to-do list. Mbeumo would make it two out of three, but the final hurdle is a frontman. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshus Zirkzee failed to deliver, and the number of forwards linked with moves to Old Trafford point towards a marquee signing.",
      "Whether it's Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen or Ollie Watkins who arrive, United will have a new No.9 on their books for the start of the new season. Wildcard options, like Moise Keane and Tolu Arokodare, offer interesting cases.",
      "However, the transfer fees required for Osimhen and Gyokeres are currently too high. That's why Dusan Vlahovic is a striker United should be all over. Not only does the Juventus player come with top-flight experience and a decent track record in front of goal - 106 in 252 games in Italy - but he has a point to prove.",
      "After bursting on to the scene with Fiorentina and then rejecting Arsenal, Vlahovic has always appeared to have doubts over his quality. Interest seems to be floated about every window but a move never occurs. But with one year left on his deal in Turin, now could be the perfect time.",
      "Reports in Italy have suggested that Juventus could look to offer Vlahovic and Douglas Luiz to United in order to sign Sancho. If United aren't going to break the bank for Gyokeres or Osimhen, then Vlahovic should be a number one candidate.",
      "Depending on your personal view on certain individuals in Amorim's squad, this figure could - or should - be more than five. Selling players is a priority that United don't want to have but are forced to.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony are all expected to be sold. Right now, there doesn't appear to be any concrete move on the cards, but there is interest. Bringing in a hefty transfer fee for Garnacho and Antony would significantly help United improve their squad, but Sancho and Rashford's monstrous wages are proving to be a problem to get them off the books permanently.",
      "The fifth name on this list is Hojlund. For large parts of this transfer window, I've backed Hojlund to stay at United and fight for his place with the anticipated newcomer. But, now, with Inter Milan and other Italian teams showing interest, the right deal would be enough to warrant a sale.",
      "If all five players did leave, I'm not sure there would be much dismay in Old Trafford. Should United get the transfer fees they have demanded for every player, they would welcome just shy of £200million.",
      "Amorim knows his current squad rather well now after last season but there have been some decisions that have provided more questions than answers; Andre Onana being dropped, only to come back in, starting Mason Mount in the Europa League final and misusing Bruno Fernandes all falling under that bracket.",
      "For me, Kobbie Mainoo's treatment has been the main head-scratcher. The midfielder was starting for England in the European Championship 12 months ago - and was destined for a huge first season as a first-team regular. That wasn't the case, though.",
      "He started 23 of his 37 appearances last season but spent the latter stages of the campaign off the bench. Coming on in the 90th minute in Bilbao against Tottenham was poor decision-making when you consider there's not many in the United team who offer the energy, passing range or passion that the academy graduate offers.",
      "There are still question marks over Manuel Ugarte and with Fernandes expected to own one of the two midfielder roles, Mainoo has all the tools to be the trusted ally for Amorim to settle things down in the middle of the park.",
      "Now for the wildcard signing, or signings, in defence. First of all, they should get Diogo Costa through the door to replace Onana. If United are going to return to their best, they have to eliminate the mistakes that Onana has been making between the posts.",
      "In defence, United are strong at centre-back and - with no European competition to contend with - there's little need for a replacement for Victor Lindelof. However, Lisandro Martinez's injury and fear over whether Ayden Heaven or Leny Yoro are necessarily 'ready' to carry the weight that comes with playing for United mean investing in Castello Lukeba, Dani Vivian or Antonio Silva would add security at the back."

      "You would be hard-pressed to find a striker who has not been linked with Manchester United in this summer's transfer window already.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, United have been left with no choice but to explore alternative avenues in their search for a goalscorer.",
      "Delap was available for £30million this summer via a release clause, meaning he would have been a relatively straightforward signing to have got over the line.",
      "However, despite scoring a respectable tally of 12 Premier League goals for relegated Ipswich Town last season, United are in need of someone more proven and experienced. It is why ongoing reports linking them with Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli ace Victor Osimhen make so much sense.",
      "The aforementioned duo have established themselves as two of Europe's most prolific and reliable goal-getters in the last couple of years. Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in the last two seasons for Sporting and Osimhen plundered 37 goals in 41 games on loan at Galatasaray in 2024/25.",
      "As a result, both of them will command hefty-sized transfer fees this summer. It is no secret United need to watch the pennies this summer, meaning outgoings will dictate what can be achieved amid their hunt for a striker.",
      "The Reds have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo looks set to command a similar fee. If they spend somewhere in the region of £120m just on those two, incomings are likely to cease until players are sold.",
      "It is why United, as desperate as they are for a No.9, may have to lower their expectations when trying to source a goal-getter and move away from those with such prestigious profiles.",
      "Among the strikers to have been linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent months is Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Frenchman, who will turn 28 later this week, enjoyed an excellent 2024/25 campaign at Selhurst Park, scoring 17 goals across all competitions.",
      "Mateta has made impressive progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz in January 2021, initially on loan, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he did need time to adjust and it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to fulfil his potential.",
      "He scored 19 times that season, meaning he has scored 36 goals over the last two campaigns for Palace. He has also chipped in with ten assists during that time.",
      "Although he did not score during Palace's run to lifting the FA Cup at Wembley in May, he did play a key role. He was particularly key to their winning goal against Manchester City in the final.",
      "Using his physicality and strength to hold off Josko Gvardiol, Mateta played a cushioned pass to Daichi Kamada, got the return, took a few strides forward, slipped in Daniel Munoz, who had made an enterprising run down the right, and he sent in a low cross that was turned in by Eberechi Eze.",
      "Eze will always be remembered for scoring the goal that earned Palace their first major trophy, but Mateta played a key role in making it possible, showcasing what his profile is all about.",
      "First and foremost, Mateta is a goalscorer, but his all-round game is about much more, making him an attractive option. He would tick a lot of boxes for United.",
      "\"He's a boring striker to play against,\" Thierry Henry said of Mateta last year. \"He doesn't lose the ball much, and he goes at the last defender.",
      "\"He uses his physicality, he's good with his head, and he scores. It's important that a striker like that gives you another dimension.\"",
      "Although he would tie in with United's objective of signing proven Premier League players this summer, he is unlikely to be available at a price they could currently entertain. His contract was due to expire next summer, but Palace triggered the option they had to extend his stay until 2027 last December, meaning they have protected his value.",
      "Had his deal been up next summer, United may have been able to convince Palace into considering a sale at a cut-price fee amid the danger of him leaving for free next year.",
      "Instead, with two years remaining on his deal, Palace, in the event of suitors coming knocking, have plenty of leeway to try and demand as a high a price as possible for one of their star attractions. Their valuation is unlikely to be affordable for United right now."

      "Amid all the noise surrounding Manchester United's summer transfer business there is one glaring priority that has produced little in the way of potential solutions.",
      "United's search for attacking midfield reinforcements has made waves in the transfer market following the arrival of Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and their public pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Similarly, it is common knowledge that United are desperate to sign a proven goalscorer. There was disappointment when Liam Delap opted to join Chelsea, while they have been linked with moves for the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Hugo Ekitike.",
      "But signing a new midfielder was also high on United's list of priorities this summer and, as of yet, there has been little in the way of progress on that front.",
      "There's even been very little in the way of transfer links, with Atalanta midfielder Ederson possibly the only notable name to have been tentatively linked with a move to Old Trafford next season.",

      "Bruno Fernandes is expected to drop back into a deeper midfield role next season and all eyes are on who will partner him at the base of midfield.",
      "Christian Eriksen will leave the club on a free transfer next week, while this summer will offer United the last chance to offload Brazilian international Casemiro, 33, for a significant transfer fee.",
      "That leaves Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo as the two other options to partner Fernandes but it also means United would need to bring in another midfield body to compete with them.",
      "Ugarte is a favourite of Ruben Amorim having worked with him at Sporting CP but hasn't quite lived up to the expectation that surrounded him when he arrived from PSG last summer.",
      "Mainoo was United's breakout star in 2023/24 and ended the season by starting for England in the final of EURO 2024. Last season proved more difficult, though, with injuries hampering his progress and Amorim seemingly not sure of his starting position.",
      "United will look to find a player to drive Ugarte and Mainoo on next season and compete to start alongside Fernandes. But if moves for Mbeumo and a forward prove to be expensive, United may look for a more cost effective option in midfield.",
      "And that search could bring them to Feyenoord captain Quinten Timber, twin brother of Arsenal defender Jurrien, who is out of contract at De Kuip at the end of next season.",
      "Transfermarkt value the Dutch international at around £30million and he is a player who Liverpool manager Arne Slot loves. Slot managed the 24-year-old at De Kuip and he described Timber as a 'special player'.",
      "When asked about links with Timber joining Arsenal, Slot told ZiggoSport: \"If he continues to develop as he has this year, then his ceiling is extremely high because he has undergone great development over the past year.",
      "\"He is a special player. He has the strength and speed to create an overload in midfield. I think he has a very good mentality and is a good lad. [Quinten and Jurrien] are both very, very good. I don't think it is ruled out that Quinten could also go to a club of [Arsenal's] calibre.\"",
      "Former Tottenham and Real Madrid midfielder Rafael van der Vaart has described him as 'incredibly good' while Dutch national team coach Ronald Koeman has spoken about how he feels Timber is ready to take the next step abroad.",
      "Given his situation, and the testimonies of Slot, Van Der Vaart and Koeman, United could do a lot worse than shopping in the Eredivisie again."

      "The 37-year-old returned to the club where he started his career two years ago, following the expiry of his contract with Leicester City. Earlier this month it was confirmed that Evans’ contract at United wouldn’t be renewed this summer, with the defender expected to leave the club.",
      "There had been reports that he was set to retire, but that is yet to be confirmed. It now however seems that is the case, with Evans staying at United, but this time as a member of staff.",
      "BBC Sport reports that the former Northern Ireland international is set to retire before taking up a role as loans manager with United. The new job will see him look after players out on loan during the 2025/26 season. He replaces Les Parry who left the club back in November.",
      "The Athletic say that United see Evans as a valuable asset to the club due to his character, professionalism and experience of winning. His role will also involve bridging the pathway between playing academy and senior football, something that he has experienced himself, coming through the youth teams at United.",
      "During his two spells at Old Trafford, Evans played 241 times, scoring eight goals. With the club as a player, he was part of a squad that won three Premier League titles, two League Cups, one FA Cup and one Champions League. He also won the FA Cup with Leicester in 2021.",

      "And then there were four. Through just a couple of taps of his smart phone, Alejandro Garnacho has joined Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony on Manchester United's list of priority sales.",
      "Garnacho already knew United are open to selling him this summer at the right price, but the club should now be looking to get him off the books in the same way they want to offload the aforementioned trio.",
      "Not for the first time in his United career, Garnacho's social media antics have done more harm than good. His decision to upload an image on his Instagram page of him wearing an Aston Villa shirt donning 'Rashford 9' on the back strengthens United's case to get rid of him.",
      "He was left out of the matchday squad for the Premier League finale against Aston Villa, but was included in the squad that travelled to Malaysia and Hong Kong for the post-season tour. He featured in both games, making one start and one substitute appearance.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim said of Garnacho during the tour: \"It's not a surprise [Garnacho is in the squad]. He's a player of Manchester United, all the players are here.",
      "\"Some players are injured and it was better not to fly here to play these two games so it's a normal situation. It's okay.\"",
      "The fact Garnacho almost certainly made his farewell appearance for United in a meaningless 3-1 win over Hong Kong is actually quite sad. He has been one of the biggest success stories of United's academy in recent years and it was not all that long ago that a path had been formed for him to enjoy a long and successful career in M16.",
      "However, his social media posts, as well as his post-match interview after the Europa League final, during which he described United's campaign as \"s**t\", has meant it looks set to end on a sour note.",
      "Having identified Rashford, who responded to Garnacho's latest social media post, Antony and Sancho as priority sales earlier this summer, no United fan had any complaints. All three of them spent time away from Old Trafford on loan last season and they do not feature in Amorim's plans.",
      "Garnacho, through his talent and undoubted potential, still had a case for staying in the eyes of some. However, whereas United were previously prepared to offload him for the right price, they now need to ensure they get him off the books this summer alongside Rashford, Sancho and Antony come what may.",
      "Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for the Argentine back in January and United are holding out for a higher fee. North of £50m is a more realistic valuation for the player, but a report by The Independent has claimed United will be asking for £70m.",
      "Whatever price United value Garnacho at, they need to offload him one way or another. His attitude and social media antics have been called into question once too often and he does not even fit into the winger-less 3-4-2-1 system they now operate in.",
      "He has undermined Amorim and he did the same with former United boss Erik ten Hag when he liked a post criticising the Dutchman for substituting him in a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in April last year.",
      "Amorim is attempting to oversee the birth of a new dawn at Old Trafford and he cannot waste time dealing with the fallout and noise generated from social media posts that purposely attempt to stir the pot.",
      "They are unnecessary and avoidable. Garnacho has just become the fourth member of a three-man wantaway list."

      "A similar attacker in the same mould of Cunha, a striker and goalkeeper are on the agenda for sporting director Jason Wilcox. For whatever reason though, United have only managed to get one new face through the door.",
      "Christian Eriksen, Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans, who is reportedly set to return to Old Trafford in a staff capacity, have already left the club and even more players are guaranteed to depart in the coming weeks.",
      "The most likely deal to be announced next is Bryan Mbeumo. After United failed in their first bid for the Brentford star, reports on Monday evening claimed a new and improved proposal had been submitted, surpassing the £60m mark. It's understood that Brentford are keen to receive a large fee up front rather than United's initial plan to spread the fee across instalments.",
      "Once another attacking playmaker is through the door, the next deal could see two surprise swap deals emerge. The first could come with Jadon Sancho departing to Juventus and the Old Lady sending Douglas Luiz and Dusan Vlahovic to Old Trafford.",
      "There's also been talk of a possible 'swap' deal with Chelsea. The Telegraph have reported that both clubs are weighing up the possibility of swapping Alejandro Garnacho and Christopher Nkunku, two players who want out of their current situations.",
      "The need to generate funds to reinvest elsewhere has never been greater than it is now. Sancho and Garnacho leaving would then place Marcus Rashford and Antony into the bomb squad as players United want to cash in on. As has been the case for most of the window, the pair continue to attract interest.",
      "Finally, a surprise exit is reportedly edging towards completion with Casemiro and Al Nassr. Saudi Arabia outlet Sport Jazirah reported early this week that Cristiano Ronaldo's team are 'close' to the signing of the Brazilian, though no fee has been reported as of yet. His exit could kickstart United's business due to his reported £375,000-per-week salary being off the books."

      "The Londoners want to receive a hefty fee up front rather than allowing their talisman to leave on a payment plan that sees United purchase Mbeumo across a number of instalments.",
      "United's need to remain compliant with financial rules means Brentford's stance could make a deal difficult to conduct. Initially, United wanted to pay Cunha's release clause over five years before agreeing to Wolves' terms of three instalments over two seasons.",
      "It could open the door for Tottenham and Thomas Frank. Spurs have been linked with reuniting Mbeumo with Frank after he left the Gtech Community Stadium for the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium earlier this month. Having beaten United in the Europa League to qualify for the Champions League, Spurs are in a much better position to meet Brentford's conditions.",

      "If United sell the trio at their respective asking prices, they will bank £92.58m to cover the £89m owed to other clubs this summer. However, offloading each member of the aforementioned trio is going to be an easier said than done task.",
      "United could be forced to send the England international out on loan for the second season running and that is a situation both the club and Rashford will want to avoid. Sancho, too, could also be difficult to offload.",

      "With that in mind, United's hopes of generating useful sums of money for two of their three wantaway players may not be so easy, meaning it could be even more of a struggle to fund new signings and cover the £89m owed on deals from previous years."

      "United failed to win back-to-back Premier League games at any point last season, meaning they last achieved that particular feat in May 2024. They most recently won back-to-back games across all competitions in March.",
      "A lack of consistency was a major problem for the Reds last season, both collectively and individually. With the exception of Bruno Fernandes and Amad, they struggled to get a regular tune out of anyone.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, for example, scored five goals in his first fives games under Ruben Amorim, meaning it felt as though he was going to overcome his slow start to the season and eat into the 16-goal haul he recorded in his first season at Old Trafford.",

He then went another six games before scoring again for the Reds.",
      "In desperate need of consistency, both collectively and individually next season, United will be unable to rely on the Dane to provide them with the regular goal-threat they will be in need of.",

He scored 20 Premier League goals last term, only being outscored by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (29), Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak (23) and Manchester City ace Erling Haaland (22).",
      "Consistency was key to Mbeumo's achievement of reaching 20 Premier League goals, with his longest drought in front of goal amounting to only five games on a single occasion. That barren run covered the start of November through to the start of December.",
      "With the exception of that blip, Mbeumo never went more than three Premier League games without a goal during the campaign. Reflecting on his season's work, he admitted consistency was key to his success.",
      "\"Consistency is really important,\" Mbeumo said, speaking to BBC Sport Africa last month. \"If you want to have big ambitions you need to perform the whole season.",
      "\"I think I am still improving every day I put a foot on the pitch. I never put limits on myself.\"",
      "United's attack has been starved of a consistent goalscorer in recent seasons, meaning supporters will be hopeful, should a deal get over the line, that Mbeumo will be able to fix that particular concern.",
      "United are not trying to sign Mbeumo to lead their attack, with the addition of a No.9 still a leading priority, but they will be hopeful the Cameroonian's reliability will give them an extra shot in the arm."

      "Few players have mastered the art of scoring goals better than Napoli striker Victor Osimhen in recent seasons.",
      "The Manchester United-linked striker has been a reliable source of goals over the last few years, scoring 85 times since the beginning of the 2022/23 season. He spent last season on loan at Galatasaray and scored a very impressive 37 goals in just 41 appearances.",
      "Unsurprisingly, the Turkish club want to re-sign the Nigerian on a permanent basis this summer. In fact, they have already called on Osimhen to make a decision on his future as quickly as possible.",
      "Galatasaray vice-president Abdullah Kavukcu, speaking during the week, said: \"Osimhen must decide as soon as possible. He always asks us for time, we respect that, he has a family too, but time runs out.",
      "\"We have made a much higher offer than other European clubs and at the moment we are not negotiating other strikers. We are not thinking about plan B, we want Osimhen.\"",
      "Napoli are open to selling Osimhen this summer after he fell out with head coach Antonio Conte almost a year ago. Director Giovanni Manna admitted as far back as February, the Serie A champions want his future sorted out as quickly as possible.",
      "Amid their desperate need for a striker this summer, United have frequently been linked with the 26-year-old in recent months. Other clubs from across Europe and Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, who have been rejected by Osimhen, have also been circling.",
      "After gambling on potential with Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee last summer, United need to sign a striker with a proven goalscoring record this summer. Osimhen ticks that particular box.",
      "The elephant in the room for United, though, is that they do not have an unlimited budget to turn to this summer. They have already spent £62.5million on Matheus Cunha and they may have to stump up a similar fee to extract Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford after recently seeing a £55m bid rebuffed.",
      "Player sales will be key to any further business United conduct this summer, meaning they are soon going to have to step up their efforts in the seller's market. United's transfer activity is currently in a bit of a lull, almost certainly impacted by the June 30 profit and sustainability rules (PSR) deadline, but the volume of activity is expected to increase come the start of July and the new financial year.",
      "United have a list of players they want to sell this summer, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed he can leave at the right price.",
      "Garnacho was the subject of interest from Napoli in January and they saw a £40m offer turned down. North of £50m is a more realistic valuation of the Argentine.",
      "United are prepared to sell any player this summer and Rasmus Hojlund has attracted interest from Inter Milan. He joined United from Atalanta almost two years ago and regressed last season after a respectable debut campaign in M16.",
      "Napoli, over the last few days, have been linked with both Hojlund and Sancho, meaning United could exploit the Italian market once again to offload their unwanted talent. Italy has been a destination for several players departing Old Trafford in recent seasons, including Scott McTominay, Omari Forson, Nemanja Matic, Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku.",
      "Napoli are reputedly keen on him and the addition of a winger is thought to be a top priority for them this summer amid their need to replace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who joined Paris Saint-Germain in January. They also want a striker.",
      "With United open to selling Hojlund and Garnacho, while also actively looking to get Sancho off the books, they have options within their ranks who they could offer to Napoli in a player-plus-cash deal for Osimhen.",
      "It would help drive the price of the Nigerian down and it would be a win-win situation for everyone involved. United will struggle to find many strikers better than Osimhen who are available this summer, but getting a deal in place may require an alternative method."

      "The last time Manchester United had a season devoid of European football was also one of the last in-person squad photos the players assembled for.",
      "Looking back at that line-up in September 2014, the squad is larger than necessary for a season where United played a meagre 44 domestic matches. Ben Amos, Anderson, Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira and Anders Lindegaard are four inclusions by default.",
      "Amos and Lindegaard did not play all season. Pereira and Anderson each played twice and Lingard once. United got Amos, Anderson and Lindegaard off the books in 2015.",
      "Jonny Evans, Tyler Blackett, Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria, Rafael da Silva, Radamel Falcao, Darren Fletcher and Adnan Januzaj had gone when the squad reassembled in front of the Scoreboard End a year later. United had the luxury of cutting their losses on misfits and past-its without any financial ramifications back then.",
      "Ruben Amorim would probably scoff at the recommendation of 27 senior professionals. United are provisionally aiming for 26, which does not seem like much of a difference but is a logical number.",
      "Three of the 26 would be goalkeepers, so whittle that down to 23 outfield players and you have two XIs and three players as cover.",
      "Van Gaal actually used 38 players in his first season, a number skewed by the wholesale changes he made for the shocking League Cup thrashing by MK Dons in early August. Saidy Janko, Reece James, Marnick Vermijl and Nick Powell were all one-and-done for the campaign that balmy night.",
      "Injuries also forced Van Gaal's hand. Paddy McNair did not have his own Wikipedia page when he made his debut against West Ham United 11 days after the first team's class photo. Evans, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones were, of course, all out injured and Blackett suspended. Tom Thorpe, on the bench, came on to play 111 seconds and remained stranded on Nelson.",
      "Including the auxiliary options Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, the only survivor of the Van Gaal squad, Amorim has seven centre backs to pick in his back three next season. Few would have Shaw in the United second XI, never mind first XI.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass are raw options on the left wing but they are a manageable pair for a sparser season. The versatile Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot are alternative options. Shaw's 27 appearances out of a possible 112 fixtures in the past two seasons place him at the back of the pecking order at centre half and left wing.",
      "United are light in midfield. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo can both play there and the former may well transition to a deeper role for the latter years of his competitive club career.",
      "But the specialists are Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Toby Collyer. Amorim seems to consider Mainoo as an option further afield, Ugarte was dropped for the Europa League final, United have tried and failed to shift Casemiro and Collyer's three starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Amad and Mason Mount are three natural fits to go into the two 10s behind the striker. The absence of a new striker is glaring but United wanted one as early as this month before Liam Delap opted for Chelsea over Cheshire.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is multi-functional and only Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland outscored him in the Premier League last term. Mbeumo is an attacker but has to be the upgrade on the right wing.",
      "United held discussions with the representatives of Sporting winger Geovany Quenda before he too chose Chelsea. Quenda is a left-footed winger by trade. As is Mbeumo.",
      "Six United players broke the 50-appearance mark in a 60-game season in 2024-25. Mbeumo started in 45 consecutive Premier League games for Brentford and completed 90 minutes in all but two. United already have durable players who can complete the entirety of one match once a week, which has to further reduce the core squad size.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's form and rapport with supporters comfortably trump Rasmus Hojlund's this calendar year, even though the Dutchman missed nine of the final ten games. As an alternative '10' or a support striker, Zirkzee has more merit as a squad player than Hojlund, who was dropped by Denmark coach Brian Riemer this month after one goal in 15 games for the national team.",
      "Chido Obi's exposure at first-team level since February and his development in the youth team make it logical to keep him in the building next season. He is a purer striker than Zirkzee and often looks more natural than Hojlund.",
      "Obi, Collyer and Shaw would be the logical 'cover'. Two academy graduates still learning their trade and the longest servant who has outstayed his welcome but is unsellable.",
      "There is a clear plan for United to streamline their attack and mould it in Amorim's image, but considerable fat to cut off. Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho is a weekly wage bill north of £1m.",
      "And United would not want any of them in a squad photo.",
      "Possible United squad 2025-25",
      "Goalkeepers: Andre Onana, new goalie, Tom Heaton",
      "Defenders: Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, Ayden Heaven, Luke Shaw, Harry Amass, Patrick Dorgu",
      "Midfielders: Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Toby Collyer, new midfielder",

      "The Serbian international spent last season on loan at Strasbourg and helped them qualify for European football next season.",

      "That is despite doubts over the performances of current number one Robert Sanchez leading Chelsea to attempt to buy AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan earlier this summer.",
      "If Monaco move for Petrovic, it kills their interest in Onana stone dead and, in turn, damages any move for Martinez.",
      "United may move for a high profile goalkeeper this summer but that would almost certainly spell the end for Onana's time at the club.",

      "14) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWith Thomas Partey on his way, following Jorginho through the free-agents’ exit, Arsenal need reinforcements in midfield. Norgaard has reportedly been identified as a value option, though Brentford aren’t likely to simply roll over and have their bellies tickled over a player who signed a new two-year contract in March.",

Which values Elanga at perhaps £50million. Which seems… excessive? Still, like James Trafford, below, Newcastle’s fondness for Elanga goes back a long way.",
      "",
      "12) Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",

      "10) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",

Talks are talking place, Trafford wants the move… expect this to happen once the new PSR year starts next week, probably for around £30million. Prompting some good old-fashion keeper dominoes.",

      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nApparently, Arsenal are hot again for Gyokeres having failed to agree a deal for Benjamin Sesko. So they’re back trying to negotiate with Sporting, who blew them out last time. Assuming they are serious and don’t switch targets for the 427th time, Arsenal want Gyokeres through the door before their pre-season tour to Asia. We just want Arsenal to pick a lane for this to be over.",

      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",

      "Troy Deeney has urged Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes to “smash” Alejandro Garnacho in training after the winger stirred up controversy by wearing a rival club’s shirt while on holiday.",
      "Garnacho, currently on a break in Ibiza, posted a photo of himself wearing an Aston Villa shirt belonging to Marcus Rashford, a move that has infuriated sections of the Man Utd fanbase and baffled pundits.",
      "Rashford, recently on loan at Villa, is also expected to leave Old Trafford this summer, speaking of his desire to play with Lamine Yamal at Barcelona.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, presenter Shebahn Aherne questioned why Garnacho would risk such a public stunt amid uncertainty over his Utd future.",
      "“Did you see that picture of Garnacho wearing the Rashford Villa shirt on holiday? The guy is an absolute wind-up,” she said. “Why would you not try to fall into line when you’re trying to make your way back into the manager’s good books?",
      "“That’s the most immature thing I’ve seen from Garnacho. It’s so immature. I didn’t think you’d get that from Garnacho.",

      "“If it was me at United, if I was Fernandes, I’d wait until he came back and smash him in training. I genuinely would.",
      "“I’m not even trying to make headlines, I’d smash him and say to him, ‘this is Man United, who do you think you are you little dope?’”",
      "Garnacho was once viewed as one of the club’s brightest young stars but endured a frustrating 2024-25 campaign. He fell down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim, and the new manager is understood to have told him he is free to leave if a suitable offer arrives.",
      "His limited minutes and unwillingness to adapt tactically, particularly in terms of defensive work rate, have reportedly contributed to Amorim’s decision. Garnacho is believed to be unhappy with his role, and the relationship between player and manager appears strained.",
      "Former Utd full-back Paul Parker recently echoed Deeney’s sentiments, suggesting the time has come for Garnacho to move on.",
      "“Garnacho has to go. There’s no way around it, because things will never work out at Manchester United. He doesn’t have the right mentality, and he doesn’t like to work hard. I don’t think that will ever change,” Parker told Tipsbladet.",
      "“It’s unbelievable because his idol, Ronaldo, was the complete opposite. He worked his ass off, so if Ronaldo really is his idol, then I think he should model himself a bit more on him and do what he does.",
      "“He needs a bit of fresh air, he needs a change of environment, and I think he could benefit from a move to another country.",
      "“Maybe going somewhere else will help him grow up and take on some responsibility. I think it’s become clear that his family isn’t good for him when it comes to football, so maybe a move with a new agent and some new advisors could help him too.”",
      "Both Napoli and Chelsea are said to be monitoring Garnacho’s situation, with Utd open to negotiating a sale if the right bid comes in. As it stands, few would be surprised if the Villa shirt incident proves to be one of his final acts as a Utd player.",

      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "3) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £131m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. And the splurge is not done yet with at least Milos Kerkez to follow."

The prospect of it being activated is considered very low.’",
      "A huge sell-on clause entitling Manchester United to 50% of any profit Marseille make on £26.7m signing Greenwood is far more relevant, especially if Liverpool act on their reported interest. Which they absolutely shouldn’t and won’t but still.",

      "Send your views to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Apologies Richard Hughes\nI’m not sure how many contributors write in to offer an apology, but after a scorching (and hungover) Sunday morning run while catching up on podcasts, I feel I owe Liverpool’s Director of Football, Richard Hughes, a sincere one. So Richard, I apologise for doubting you. Not that you’d care one jot.",
      "It’s now clear that far from being paralysed with fear à la Roy Hodgson, that you, along with Michael Edwards and the data team have been meticulously laying the groundwork for what might turn out to be our most significant transfer window in six years, if not ever.",
      "I’m absolutely astonished we’ve landed Wirtz, the best player on the market this year. Like many fans, I’m dying to know what Arne Slot said to convince him to choose Anfield. Over pints at the pub this weekend, a few mates and I concluded it might’ve just been three simple words: “My Bobby Firmino.”",
      "On top of that, the potential replacements of Trent, Robbo, Diaz, and Alisson with Wirtz, Frimpong, Kerkez, and Mamardashvili drop the average age of our starting XI from 26.7 to 24.3. That’s no small feat, and it’s been done quickly and quietly.",
      "Now, I can’t wrap this up without a gentle jab at our rivals.",
      "I love how certain respected journalists continue to cozy up to Sir Alex Ferguson by framing the signings of Cunha and possibly Mbeumo as proof Man United still have pulling power. Hmm. Back in SAF’s day, they’d have been in for Wirtz and prising Nico Williams out of Spain. Now, they’re celebrating buying the best player from a side that finished below them, who spent 77.6% of the season walking (for comparison, VVD was 76%). Oh, and he gets a 67% pay rise for the privilege. It’s not quite taking Margot Robbie home!!",
      "As for Arsenal, their current blend of self-righteousness and transfer window anxiety is best summed up not by me, but by Paddy Power’s Instagram feed. Nothing I write here could possibly top that.",
      "And to Manchester (115) City and Chelsea, enjoy being pawns in Infantino’s U.S. experiment while Salah, Mac Allister, and Gravenberch are recovering on a beach somewhere. I’m sure playing in 35°C heat all July will have zero effect on your squad fitness come spring.",

      "Nobody wins the transfer window\nA few days ago, another reader wrote in claiming the Club World Cup was going to be the second-best club tournament in the world – after berating English fans as being biased against the tournament and lauding the teams (South American) who were taking it seriously. Ironic that he didn’t consider that those same teams might consider their equivalent of the Champions League – the Copa Libertadores – as either the best or, at worst, second-best club competition. No?",
      "Of course, being mid-season probably helps those clubs – still early enough in their season, they are fresh, while having a chance to gel as a team. Compared to those from Europe who have played non-stop for almost 11 months, and with the international break and bedding in new players, it will take a game or two to get back up to speed. Notwithstanding the heat they are dealing with.",
      "On that topic. I am reading about how baseball players are throwing up, needing to be withdrawn, and requiring misting and hydration stations to survive games. And this is in a sport that doesn’t require the same level of endurance, stamina, and cardiovascular exertion. Of course, this was all predictable. Not a great portent for next year’s World Cup. Not sure what’s worse though, all the fawning over the competition by pundits, totally ignoring all the issues or the competition itself.",
      "Lastly, no one wins a transfer window. It’s exciting when new players are brought in. I get it. But if past transfer windows are any gauge…just recently, Chelsea acquired 12 players in 2023, including Jackson, Palmer, Caicado and Lavia, with many Chelsea fans lauding ‘winning’ Caicedo and Lavia over Liverpool. But Liverpool did better during that season and the following year won the league with just one signing to Chelsea’s 10 signings.",
      "Some assumptions around Liverpool doing well are for signings that haven’t yet happened but might happen. And what if any of those new guys, particularly Wirtz gets injured? Frimpong is not a like-for-like exchange for TAA, and his defending stats are actually worse. Kerkez isn’t a Liverpool player yet, and Wirtz still has to be slotted (pun intended) into the current team without disrupting what worked well last season.",
      "The point is, there is a long way to go. City and Chelsea have a chance to get some early pre-season in for new players, as they are going to have a shorter traditional pre-season.",
      "For United fans bemoaning little transfer action so far, it isn’t just related to the quality of the management team in place (which is poor to be fair) but the fact that once you drop down a level, have no Champions League draw card and have to reduce the wage budget – as the past overpaying for mediocre players takes its toll – means waiting until the ‘big boys’ have had their pick of the crop.",
      "While things could be turned around – as other teams have shown – picking an only-one-way-to-play manager, playing a style that doesn’t suit most of the current squad and hasn’t shown itself to be that effective, was probably the worst decision the club could have made at this point. He’s not a draw card either. So while I said there’s no winning a transfer season, Utd are going to show the downside of being the ‘second best’ in this case.\nPaul McDevitt",

      "There are always people who treat all supporters of other teams with petty prejudices and outlandish generalisations, there also exists a large group of people who I would say is far more common and exemplifies an awful lot of fans, it’s the “it’s more important you fail, than we succeed” band.",
      "All teams will spend or have spent money in the belief that there squad will be improved, some clubs will sell their prized assets but will aim to re-invest this in other hidden gems. And yet, rather than talk up their team’s chances of a better season than last, a large number of people are fixated on the potential “flops” of their rivals.",
      "Man City have spent in excess of £400mil since the turn of the year and have signed a fabulous forward from the Bundesliga, the “midfielder of the season” from Serie A, a French “wonderkid” and some others at around the £40mil mark. Chelsea have bought a centre forward who may able to stay on the pitch for more than four minutes. Arsenal are seeking the mythical “centre forward” that has cost them the last three titles and a world class DM to allow Declan Rice to flourish. Even ManU look to have upgraded on their mis-firing forward line and are not finished yet.",
      "Despite this, quite a number seem pre-occupied with talking about how much Liverpool’s signings may “flop”. The fact that last season’s champions have (to use comments from last season) replaced a right back who can’t defend, an over the hill left back, signed a creative ball playing midfielder/forward to replace their non creative, non goalscoring, stagnant midfield and appear to be keen to add a centre forward to replace their megaflop and possibly strengthen their centre back options, would worry me immensely if I supported any other team.",
      "I know people will/can be ridiculed if they make big statements (e.g. the title is won already) but surely any “normal” supporter should be saying, “our signings have made us better, our signings will mean we will do better than last season”, otherwise, what’s the point, talk about your team, your hopes and dreams, don’t tie yourself up in knots wishing others to fail, embrace your own possibilities!",

      "But there’s obviously something qualitative that happens to dip between the U21 and senior England teams. Not just the inevitable drop off subtracting merely talented footballers with the absolute top of approximately 24 players remaining. Have the U21 players simply got things to prove still and peak as teens? While the senior players are just maintaining earned privileged status and a lavish mortgage?",
      "The game is also trending young btw. Especially with the Mbappe example of 2018 World Cup which he’s not repeated once he got the fame and big salary. Yamal wins the Euros at 16-17 and may be on the same trajectory as Mbappe, not likely to repeat the international feats of his teen years in his 20s.",
      "Historically European players are said to peak around 26-27 blending their gifts with hard won experience. Recent international football results have been produced by fast fast running teenagers who cheekily trounce slightly older men.",
      "Delaying the use of Palmer or Gordon, while keeping n the slightly more senior Saka or Rice for example, in the last tournament might have cost Southgate his trophy.\nDan McG LFC",

      "Carsley for England\nPlease can someone explain why Lee Carsley is not the England manager. We have learned over many years that big name managers don’t work, and Lee has proven himself time and time again that he knows how to manage an international team.",

      "Contract talks with the Ghanaian have ‘collapsed’ after he asked for an increase in his £200,000 per week salary to extend his deal at the Emirates.",
      "PSG’s Warren Zaire-Emery, Barcelona’s Marc Casado and Real Madrid’s Eduardo Camavinga represent unlikely options thought to be of interest to Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, with Agoume a more realistic option along with Lille’s teen sensation Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet Fichajes has confirmed that Arsenal see Agoume – whose game has been compared to N’Golo Kante – ‘as an interesting option for its balance between physical, tactical criteria and projection’.",
      "The report claims ‘Arsenal seems to be the closest destination’ but with ‘nothing closed yet’, both Tottenham and Manchester United have entered the race.",
      "‘Tottenham see in Agoume an opportunity to add a young and versatile profile in the centre of the field’, while United ‘consider the Frenchman an alternative to rebuild an area of the team that showed many shortcomings last season’ after a less than impressive first campaign for £42m Manuel Ugarte.",
      "It’s claimed that without European football the Red Devils will ‘seduce the player with minutes and a solid project’…",
      "United are also desperate to land a new striker after a poor season for Rasmus Hojlund, who’s been heavily linked with a move to Serie A, and after top target Viktor Gyokeres confirmed he has no interest in a move to Old Trafford, a very surprising move for Everton’s Beto – who moved to Goodison Park for £21m from Udinese in 2023 – has been mooted by the president of Uniao Tires, the striker’s first club.",
      "“Everyone thought Amorim would sign Gyokeres as he had him at Sporting, but the Premier League is completely different to Portugal,” Lopes told The Sun.",
      "“Teams are more physical and compact at the back, it is quicker and more competitive. Gyokeres would struggle to play as a lone No 9 waiting for service.",
      "“Beto’s a more physical player, who fights with defenders and doesn’t lose duels. He is a real headache for opponents — if he gets the service. In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces but haven’t had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there is an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "“Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate — plus he is very fast. When Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he is for defenders to stop. He’d be like Amorim’s ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.”"

Meanwhile, in the locker room there is division of opinions, and some players hope that the final decision will not alter the internal harmony or the positive dynamics that are sought to be built under the new technical direction.’",

      "But Villa’s £40m asking price may well prove to be a barrier for United, with the club in the market for new players in multiple positions after their worst season in living memory and with not a great deal of spare cash to spend given their failure to qualify for Europe as a result of that dreadful campaign.",
      "With that in mind, they’ve reportedly made an opening bid of €15m [£12.8m] for Lunin, who impressed for Los Blancos last season as he covered for the injured Thibaut Courtois, but has found himself back on the sidelines this term following the Belgium international’s return to full fitness.",
      "Lunin recently extended his Madrid contract to 2030 but did so ‘on the condition of reviewing his situation at the end of the season’, which prompted United to hold ‘conversations’ with Lunin’s agent, Jorge Mendes, and make the bid, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",

      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",

But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "GK: Kepa Arrizabalaga (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, £71.6m)\nGianluigi Buffon was the world’s most expensive goalkeeper for 5,820 days. Ederson reigned for just over 13 months. Alisson only managed three weeks.",
      "Kepa retains that mantle seven years on, despite spending much of the intervening time not even his own club’s best shot-stopper, nor even at his own club.",
      "Chelsea continue to stumble and muddle through imperfect goalkeeping solutions despite otherwise spending literal billions assembling their squad, with Kepa deemed entirely surplus to requirements and ready to board the Arsenal train for a fair whack less than Chelsea paid.",

      "CB: Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, £80m)\nAnother whose stock has fluctuated wildly between most expensive player ever in his position and saviour of the future, to poster boy for financial incompetence, Maguire is on his latest successful quest to win over a manager who tried to phase him out.",
      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",

      "RW: Antony (Ajax to Manchester United, £82m)\nDoubts were expressed long before Manchester United completed the second most expensive signing in their history, and the only 180s conducted since have been by Antony himself.",
      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",
      "",
      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",
      "Caicedo long seemed destined to join Chelsea in the summer of 2023, but some painful attempts at bargaining with actual professional poker player Tony Bloom saw their bids fall predictably short at £80m.",
      "Then Liverpool crashed in with an offer of £111m, accepted by Brighton but certainly not by Caicedo himself, who had agreed personal terms with the Blues and was in no mood to renege.",
      "That prompted Chelsea to eventually find a breakthrough in talks with Brighton, paying a premium for the inconvenience caused and leaving Liverpool with a small amount of egg on their faces.",
      "If enough of the £15m in clauses are activated, Caicedo will become the most expensive player in Premier League history. He is already the biggest transfer step down.",
      "",
      "CM: Declan Rice (West Ham to Arsenal, £100m)\nIt took two rejected bids, a rubbish Manchester City hijack attempt, more chat about payment structure than anyone would care to admit and a torturous wait for The Paperwork to be filed, but Arsenal finally inserted what they hoped to be the final piece of their jigsaw before jetting off on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies. But two years in he has been unable to drag them over the line, although little of that is down to the shortcomings of Rice himself.",
      "",
      "CM: Enzo Fernandez (Benfica to Chelsea, £106.8m)\nThere were precious few positives to glean from Chelsea’s miserable first season without their Roman Abramovich stabilisers. Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",
      "It took a while and some managerial change for things to properly click but Fernandez and Chelsea are finally on the right track.",
      "",
      "LW: Jack Grealish (Aston Villa to Manchester City, £100m)\nA year is a long old time in football. While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",
      "It turns out that there aren’t many clubs out there willing to either match the sort of wage Manchester City offer, or the kind of fee they need to tick enough PSR boxes. And Pep Guardiola couldn’t care less.",
      "",
      "AM: Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, £100m)\nIt’s done. Liverpool have smashed their transfer record, which could rise by another £16m. It’s the biggest transfer of the 2025 summer window and surely won’t be usurped.",
      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai. Put it this way: Wirtz will hope to be more like Erling Haaland or Heung-min Son than Jadon Sancho – who he replaces in this XI – or Jean-Kevin Augustin.",
      "Wirtz is absolutely good enough to justify his huge transfer fee, but that kind of money can weigh heavy on some players. We’re excited to see which way he goes.",
      "",
      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",
      "Buying clubs: Chelsea (x4), Liverpool (x2), Manchester United (x2), Manchester City (x2), Arsenal (x1)",
      "Total cost: £989.9m",
      "Most expensive players to miss out:\nPaul Pogba (Juventus to Manchester United, £89.3m)\nRomelu Lukaku (Everton to Manchester United, £75m)\nJadon Sancho (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United, £73m)\nNicolas Pepe (Lille to Arsenal, £72m)\nKai Havertz (Bayer Leverkusen to Chelsea, £71m)\nWesley Fofana (Leicester to Chelsea, £70m)\nRuben Dias (Benfica to Manchester City, £65m)\nKai Havertz (Chelsea to Arsenal, £65m)\nDarwin Nunez (Benfica to Liverpool, £64m)\nRasmus Hojlund (Atalanta to Manchester United, £64m)\nRodri (Atletico Madrid to Manchester City, £62.8m)\nMatheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United, £62.5m)\nMykhaylo Mudryk (Shakhtar Donetsk to Chelsea, £62m)",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
