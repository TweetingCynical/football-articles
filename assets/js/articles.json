      "Manchester United fans are having to be patient for their next signing, with Matheus Cunha's arrival yet to be followed up. The Red Devils triggered the Brazilian's £62.5million release clause to bring him in from Wolves and quickly turned their attention to Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But acquiring Mbeumo has proven more difficult. Brentford are demanding at least £60m for the Cameroon international, who's already indicated that he wants to join United over other potential suitors.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs are reluctant to pay that amount given that they haven't been able to sanction a big sale so far this summer. Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho could all bring in significant funds, but finding buyers for the attacking quartet is no easy task.",
      "Ruben Amorim's focus isn't just on Mbeumo either, with the Red Devils' goalkeeping situation uncertain. Emiliano Martinez is claimed to be United's priority but Amorim and Co. have alterantives who could challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot - or even replace him.",
      "Here's a round-up of the latest transfer news from Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United have identified Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin as an alternative to top target Emiliano Martinez, according to reports in Spain. United know that Aston Villa star Martinez has offers from Saudi Arabia, so the Red Devils are making contingency plans.",
      "As reported by Spanish outlet Defensa Central, United have spoken to Lunin's agent, Jorge Mendes, about a deal for the 26-year-old. But they only want to pay £13m, a far cry from Real's asking price of around £20m.",
      "Napoli have reportedly joined Italian rivals Inter Milan in the race to sign Rasmus Hojlund. Inter were installed as the favourites to sign Hojlund, 22, earlier this month but now Napoli are claimed to have held talks.",

      "Ralf Rangnick has diagnosed former club Manchester United with a 'leadership problem' which has blighted them for the 12 years post-Sir Alex Ferguson. Rangnick, who's now in charge of the Austrian national team, spent six months as manager at Old Trafford in the 2021-22 season, arguably their most underwhelming Premier League campaign to date.",
      "With Cristiano Ronaldo leading the line, Paul Pogba in midfield and Raphael Varane at the back, big things were expected after a second-place finish the previous term. But neither Rangnick or his predecessor, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, were able to find a winning formula, as the Red Devils slumped to sixth.",
      "The plan was for Rangnick, 66, to become a consultant following the end of his six-month spell as interim boss. But when Erik ten Hag was appointed in April 2022, United abruptly cut ties with the acclaimed German coach, who's renowned as one of the great minds of the modern game.",
      "Rangnick had been openly critical of the regime at Old Trafford, infamously insisting that the squad needed 'open heart surgery' during one of his many sobering press conferences. In the three years since his departure, the former Schalke, Hoffenheim and RB Leipzig manager - nicknamed the 'Godfather of the Gegenpress' - has continued to point of United's flaws.",
      "Despite the club's hierarchy undergoing a seismic change over the last 18 months, prompted by Sir Jim Ratcliffe's partial takeover, Rangnick still believes that the Red Devils lack a proper leadership structure. It's an issue which he believes stems from the moment Ferguson retired after 26 highly successful years.",
      "\"I think we have to go back to 2013, when Sir Alex left the club,\" Rangnick told Spanish outlet Sport. \"And at the time he was still there, he was the mastermind behind it all. He probably also brought a lot of important people to the club.",
      "\"And the moment he left, some of those people probably left the club as well. And, since then, I think they have a leadership problem. Who's really making the decisions and why are they making them? Are they really the best people for the job? I can only tell you that the six months I was there, it was difficult to say, even for me as head coach.",
      "\"Who were the decision makers? Who? Who could I talk to? If we wanted to sign new players, it was difficult. There were people, but in the end, it was difficult.\"",
      "So, what advice would Rangnick give United's current regime led by new CEO Omar Berrada, sporting director Jason Wilcox and Ratcliffe's INEOS bigwigs? \"If I were the owner or sporting director of a club, I would only try to sign and invest in young players. Because no matter how you look at it, it only makes sense,\" the Austria boss explained.",
      "\"Does it make sense to spend 30, 40, 50 million on a 28 or 30-year-old signing? Not really. Let's calculate it: You sign a 28 or 30-year-old with a five-year contract; you spend 50 million more on the transfer fee; an average of 15 million euros per year multiplied by five.",
      "\"That's 65 million plus the 50 million transfer fee, equals 115 million plus the agents' fees. The whole operation costs you around 130 million.\""

They have also got Crystal Palace star Eze on their list of potential targets and are long-time admirers of the England international.",
      "It has been widely reported that Eze has a £68m buy-out clause in his contract which would be seen as great value in the current market. Palace will be desperate to keep 26-year-old Eze who has just enjoyed the best season of his career by helping them win the FA Cup and potentially get a place in Europe.",
      "Tottenham weighed up a move last summer but ultimately Palace chairman Steve Parish said he was surprised they did not receive any firm bids. But after enjoying such an impressive season, Eze is likely to attract firm interest again this summer and Spurs are in the market for a wide player.",
      "Tottenham remain keen on Mbeumo but face major competition from Manchester United who have made a £55m bid for the Brentford forward. Frank has a strong link with Mbeumo from Brentford and will be keen to bring him in but the forward has been keen on going to United. That deal is still a possibility for Spurs but they remain determined to strengthen.",

      "Essugo, 20, joined Chelsea in the summer for £18.5m and will always be grateful for Amorim for putting him in the first team after just ONE training session. Portugal under-21 star Essugo said: “He brought me to the first team so he helped me a lot, to understand the game, to reach the level I am here now.",

      "Essugo says he learned a lot from those players and Amorim but also wants to be his own man rather than be compared to players like Claude Makelele or Michael Essien and N’Golo Kante who have obvious similarities.",
      "He said: “To be honest, I never saw Makelele on TV but the people told me a lot about Makelele and say I have some similar parts of his game. They are big players. I want to make my own way but also like to see Makelele, Essien and Kante, to follow their steps.",
      "“I always play as a midfielder but also I am a defensive midfielder but I also like to go forward with the ball, box to box. Of course it is good when they compare you with a very big player but it is a mix of both because I want to try to have my way, to achieve the top.”",
      "And when Chelsea came calling this summer, there was never any doubt in Essugo’s mind about where to go. His dad now manages his career after a career in construction while his mum works in a kitchen.",
      "Now Essugo wants to cook up something special at Stamford Bridge and says Enzo Maresca has also been hugely positive since he arrived. He added: “Chelsea helped my parents so many times. I feel very good. When my father said Chelsea want me to come here, of course I can’t say no.",

      "When Sir Jim Ratcliffe took his initial 27.7percent share of Manchester United, the top line was that he would be taking charge of football operations. Turns out ‘football operations’ included sacking office staff and giving ticket prices a hike after a season that included EIGHTEEN Premier League defeats.",
      "And just for effect, news of the increases came on a day when the fixtures for the next Premier League season were published - a day that should be about hope and optimism and about wiping the slate clean. Increasingly, Ratcliffe and his INEOS Group are becoming the embodiment of people who know how to make billions out of business but are clueless when it comes to winning the hearts of minds of a football club’s fanbase.",
      "Perhaps they are not overly interested in hearts and minds, perhaps they really are only interested in money. After all, it will take many, many more years - possibly decades - of underachievement on the field of play before United loses its allure as one of sport’s most iconic institutions.",
      "That might be a hard notion for rival supporters to stomach but that is fact. United could probably double ticket prices and still sell Old Trafford out.",
      "The crowd’s demographic would be different - there would be a lot of tourists around - but they would still fill the stadium. And they would probably fill a new one seating 100,000.",
      "But these ticket prices are not particularly jaw-dropping in scale, to be honest. The Manchester United Fans’ Advisory Board even said: “We are relieved that the club was persuaded to limit the increases to the same percentage rise as recent seasons and we are pleased they froze prices for our youngest fans.”",
      "But that same group had called for a ticket-price freeze that they “felt was justified due to the current circumstances.” And that is the point.",
      "After the season United had - ending in the dismal Europa League final defeat - asking fans to pay more for the privilege of watching a strictly mediocre team almost smacks of having a laugh at the supporters’ expense. It smacks of doing it because they know they can.",
      "It is common for clubs, for ticket pricing purposes, to categorise games, but on the evidence of their performances at Old Trafford last season, is ANY game involving this United side a Category A match? But there are six Category A games at Old Trafford next season - against Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur - and tickets for those fixtures range from £59 to £97.",
      "No matter what your take on the scale of the increases - and United are certainly not the only club to do this - it is the fact the increases come against a backdrop of players under-performing hugely for hugely over-inflated salaries. It comes against a backdrop of the Glazers having taken out millions and millions in dividends over the period of their ownership.",
      "And it is simply hard to believe that, as a nod towards United’s fantastic support, the club and Sir Jim and INEOS could not have stood a season in which ticket prices remained the same. Actually, scrap that.",

His dream move to Barcelona may now be off the cards - despite his thinly-veiled come-get-me-plea - and the forward appears to be selling himself as the central striker that United are looking for.",

The Portuguese is sticking wholeheartedly with his 3-4-3 formation which is yet to bear fruit in Manchester, with the pair both set for starting spots as the twin No.10s, either side of a No.9.",

      "Liverpool have set the early pace in the transfer market after completing deals for Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong and Armin Pecsi and there's little sign they're slowing down. Wirtz's arrival is the big move of the summer thus far with the Reds requiring to pay up to £116million with add-ons.",
      "Milos Kerkez is next expected through the door, with a medical scheduled for during the week. Liverpool have agreed a £40m fee with Bournemouth and personal terms are already agreed.",
      "And a striker is still on the agenda. While Alexander Isak is appreciated, prising him away from Newcastle will prove difficult after the Magpies claimed Champions League football.",
      "But with Darwin Nunez set to depart, a forward is likely to be on Arne Slot's list. A number of other exits could await too as Andy Robertson, Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa all consider their futures.",
      "Italian outlet Tutto Mercato Web claim Liverpool have made a proposal to Napoli to sign Victor Osimhen. The Serie A champions are keen to offload the Nigeria international, who spent last term on loan at Galatasaray.",
      "Osimhen has been linked with Manchester United already this summer as they target a new striker, and the forward is said to have snubbed a move to Al-Hilal. Liverpool are hoping to tempt Napoli into a deal by offering up Darwin Nunez and Federcio Chiesa in exchange for the 26-year-old",
      "Darwin is expected to leave Anfield this summer after a tough season. Chiesa meanwhile has been told by new Italy boss Gennaro Gattuso that he must play more frequently to be part of his plans with the national team.",
      "Napoli have made Darwin Nunez their primary target up front this summer and will not advance negotiations over other options until they know whether making a deal with Liverpool is feasible, per reports.",
      "The Italian side are set to continue talks with the Reds next week having already made a verbal offer in the region of €40m (34m). That would see the club make a significant loss on the Uruguay international who signed for more than £85m.",
      "Lorenzo Lucca and Rasmus Hojlund have been touted as alternatives but Darwin is Antonio Conte's favoured option for the moment. Liverpool are said to want £43m for the striker.",
      "Marc Guehi is only willing to leave Crystal Palace if he is assured of being a regular first-team starter, per reports. The defender has long been admired by Liverpool, and has drawn interest from the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle.",
      "The Eagles star is in the final year of his contract but Palace still want a £40m fee. The Reds do not want to overpay for Guehi, but with the sale of Jarell Quansah and uncertainty over Ibrahima Konate, speculation is sure to continue.",

His future has been the subject of speculation, even if Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has dismissed any suggestion he could leave. Here's the latest transfer rumours from the red side of Manchester.",
      "Martinez is already sold on the idea of joining United this summer and is said to have rebuffed offers from 'big-hitters' in the hope of pushing through a dream switch to Old Trafford. There has been speculation that Martinez could move on with Villa potentially needing to sell in order to meet Profit and Sustainability Rules.",

      "No bids have yet been received despite well documented interest in Rashford and, as things stand, the 27-year-old will report back to Carrington to begin his pre-season preparations.",

      "Monaco are torn between pursing two Premier League goalkeepers but could yet offer Andre Onana a route out of Manchester after two difficult years. French outlet L'Equipe have claimed that Monaco are looking to add a new shotstopper to their squad.",
      "They want to upgrade their current options with Radoslaw Madecki and Philipp Kohn currently on their books. Onana is one player who has been shortlisted along with Chelsea's Djordje Petrovic.",
      "Onana has remained the No 1 at Old Trafford, albeit he was dropped briefly last term, whilst Petrovic has slipped down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge as Robert Sanchez established himself as first choice.",

      "The Napoli frontman felt he couldn't compete with his fellow countryman for a starting spot knowing that ultimately one of them would lose out, which motivated his move to Italy.",
      "Osimhen's brother, Andrew, told Complete Sports: \"It is very true that Manchester United wanted Victor, but he told me something like he had too much respect for Odion Ighalo to be competing for shirts with his senior colleague. My brother holds Ighalo in high esteem and he just didn't see himself going to Old Trafford to battle for a striking role with the highest goalscorer at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt.\"",

Brentford have rejected their opening offers with Tottenham, who now have Thomas Frank at the helm, hoping they can swoop in and seal a move for the Cameroonian. He's just enjoyed the best year of his career and is tipped to move on, but still favours a switch to Manchester.",
      "He, like Cunha, would likely thrive in one of the positions behind the frontman. Equally though Bruno Fernandes, the club's talisman, has occupied one of those roles but may drop deeper to accommodate all the attacking talent that could be arriving in Manchester.",
      "With Gyokeres favouring other destinations Amorim's search for and out and out striker continues. Scoring goals was a well documented problem for the Red Devils and, after also missing out on Delap, Victor Osimhen could now come into play. The Nigerian's time in Napoli is up.",
      "He was pushed out of loan last term, scoring regularly at Galatasaray, and he's turned down a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia which underlines his desire to remain in Europe. Osimhen has just 12 months left on his deal meaning he could be available for less than his market value.",
      "At the other end of the pitch Andre Onana is still yet to convince despite having two years in between the sticks. He has continued to come up with errors and was even dropped by Amorim last term. Aston Villa's Emi Martinez is a man who is linked with pastures new.",
      "He appeared to say his goodbyes and cut an emotional figure on his last outing at Villa Park. Rumours have mounted that United are keen, and their interest is reciprocated by the Argentina No 1 himself whilst Monaco are understood to be keen on Onana.",
      "In front of the goalkeeper, despite potentially wanting to bolster his defensive line, Amorim may have to stick with what he's got. United ultimately don't have a bottomless pit of cash and if they landed Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen and Martinez it would take them beyond the £200m mark.",
      "Those signings could yet be aided by some significant departures with Alejandro Garnacho being among the most significant. Previously cited as a player for the long haul, he has since fallen down the pecking order and his attitude was called into question following his snub in the Europa League final.",
      "Man Utd's possible XI: Martinez; Yoro, Maguire, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dalot; Cunha, Mbeumo, Osimhen.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Liverpool manager Arne Slot is making up for lost time this summer after opening the transfer floodgates at Anfield. And it has taken the Dutchman just a few weeks to break the rule predecessor Jurgen Klopp sought to adhere to above all others in the market.",
      "Klopp, 58, previously made a point of stressing his morals when it came to keeping Liverpool financially solvent. And that meant not necessarily spending on a par with the likes of Manchester City and Manchester United, who copped criticism from the former Reds boss for their free-spending ways in the past.",
      "Of course that changed over time as Liverpool made allowances in opening their chequebook so Klopp could compete. But the German was staunchly against spending £100million fees on individuals when he first arrived at Anfield – a line Liverpool have now crossed with the blockbuster signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen in a British record deal worth up to £116m, with £100m of that being guaranteed.",
      "\"If you bring one player in for £100m or whatever and he gets injured then it all goes through the chimney,\" Klopp warned back in 2016 after United forked out £89m to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \"The day that this is football, I’m not in a job any more, because the game is about playing together.",
      "\"That is why somebody invented passes so these players can play together. It’s not about running with the ball because you can do it all the time. Building the group is not my unique idea – it is necessary to be successful in football.",
      "\"Other clubs can go out and spend more money and collect top players, yes. Do I have to do it differently to that? I don’t know exactly how much money we could spend because nobody has told me up to this point, ‘No, no, no you can’t do this.’",
      "\"If I spend money it is because I am trying to build a real team. You can win championships, you can win titles. But maybe there is a manner in which you want it. It is about how it is.\"",
      "The Merseysiders have added 22-year-old Wirtz to their armoury and could have to shell out as much as £116m if certain conditions are met. And that addition means Liverpool have now spent more money in this window than any other in their history to date.",
      "Slot recruited Jeremie Frimpong (also from Leverkusen) for £29.5m earlier in the summer, while goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili has joined from Valencia for an initial £25m, along with £4m in add-ons – with that deal agreed last summer counting towards their 2025 spending. Not only that, but a £40m move for Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is also in the pipeline.",
      "Provided the Kerkez deal goes through as expected, that would take Liverpool's total spend this summer to roughly £215m (providing all bonus clauses are met). And despite the fact the transfer window has been open for less than one month, that would far eclipse the previous record for total spend in any other window.",
      "The closest Klopp came to matching that sum was in the summer of 2018 when he spent around £170m on new signings. That included Alisson from Roma (£65m), Naby Keita from RB Leipzig (£53m), Fabinho from Monaco (£39m) and Xherdan Shaqiri from Stoke (£13.5m), though the investments paid off as they won the Champions League that season.",
      "Eventually, Klopp wasn't too far from overseeing a couple of nine-digit deals himself, considering Liverpool signed Virgil van DIjk and Darwin Nunez for £75m and £85m, respectively. Van Dijk became the most expensive defender in football history at the time of his move from Southampton, and Klopp later walked back his comments concerning exorbitant transfer fees.",
      "\"These kind of things happen. When you want to sign a striker as exciting as Darwin is, that’s the market and you have to pay the price,\" he conceded in 2023. \"I said so many things in my life and life caught me then later and showed me that my imagination was obviously not clear enough for how quickly life can change. That’s how it is.",
      "\"After that [comment about Pogba], we bought a centre-half for quite a decent fee [£75m for Van Dijk], we bought a goalie for quite a decent fee [Alisson]. Our situation is always the same, we try to level it somehow [with sales], the things we invest in the boys and in the players we sell, it’s kind of that it’s not going out of any kind of range and that worked so far, but I know, I heard it immediately.\"",
      "To Slot's credit, he won the Premier League in his debut campaign despite barely spending at all last summer. It's only fair that one, therefore, takes into account that spread of cost, which brings his net spend to a more modest £100m or so per summer window so far."

      "Having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and facing the prospect of paying a similar fee for Bryan Mbeumo, Manchester United's summer spending might soon smash its way through the £200m mark.",
      "That is because United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, back in March, revealed the club would be forced to cough up £89m in transfer fees this summer before even thinking about new additions.",
      "It is not uncommon nowadays for clubs to spread out the costs of new signings and pay for them in instalments over several years, meaning United will be paying for players recruited in previous summers this summer.",
      "\"If you look at the players that we will buy this summer that we did not buy, in other words, we're paying for, that it is, we're buying Antony this summer,\" Ratcliffe told Gary Neville in an interview for Sky.",
      "\"We're buying [Jadon] Sancho this summer, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana.",
      "\"It's not a light switch. In your day [Neville's], you bought a player and that was it. I know that the bill we will pay this summer is £89m for players that have been signed previously. If we buy no players, we write a cheque for £89m this summer.\"",
      "Having rejected United's opening offer of £55m for Mbeumo, it is understood Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the one Wolves banked for Cunha. Talks between United and Brentford remain ongoing and there is a growing belief an agreement will eventually be reached.",
      "The likelihood is, though, that United will have to pay a fee in the region of £60m to extract the Cameroonian from the Gtech Community Stadium, meaning the deal, taking into account the £89m owed elsewhere, could take United's spending to just north of £210m.",
      "Considering head coach Ruben Amorim also wants to add a striker, a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer, it highlights just how important player sales are for United between now and the 7pm deadline on September 1.",
      "Failure to qualify for next season's Champions League means revenue streams will be not as lucrative as they would have otherwise been in 2025/26, meaning United must be shrewd with their recruitment. They have already had to break their own rule of not going above £60m for a player and they may have to do it twice more this summer to get Mbeumo and the centre-forward they so desperately crave.",
      "Rashford, who spent the second half of the season at Aston Villa, is valued at £40m, Sancho, who is no longer joining Chelsea on a permanent basis, is available for somewhere in the region of £20m and Antony, who impressed at Real Betis, needs to be sold for £32.58m to ensure United avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "If United sell the trio at their respective asking prices, they will bank £92.58m to cover the £89m owed to other clubs this summer. However, offloading each member of the aforementioned trio is going to be an easier said than done task.",
      "United could be forced to send the England international out on loan for the second season running and that is a situation both the club and Rashford will want to avoid. Sancho, too, could also be difficult to offload.",
      "His wages could be problematic for any suitor, even if the transfer fee itself might not be too much of a struggle. Napoli are reputedly keen on Sancho, who is out of contract next summer, but they are said to be reluctant to meet his wage demands, according to reports in Italy.",
      "With that in mind, United's hopes of generating useful sums of money for two of their three wantaway players may not be so easy, meaning it could be even more of a struggle to fund new signings and cover the £89m owed on deals from previous years."

      "One of the biggest problems Manchester United experienced last season was a lack of consistency.",
      "Every time it felt as though United had taken one step forward, they immediately took two steps back. The biggest example of that was when they beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium in December and then lost their next four games.",
      "United failed to win back-to-back Premier League games at any point last season, meaning they last achieved that particular feat in May 2024. They most recently won back-to-back games across all competitions in March.",
      "A lack of consistency was a major problem for the Reds last season, both collectively and individually. With the exception of Bruno Fernandes and Amad, they struggled to get a regular tune out of anyone.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, for example, scored five goals in his first fives games under Ruben Amorim, meaning it felt as though he was going to overcome his slow start to the season and eat into the 16-goal haul he recorded in his first season at Old Trafford.",
      "But after a double helped United come from behind to beat Viktoria Plzen 2-1 in the Europa League on December 12, he then went 21 games without a goal, not getting himself on the scoresheet again until United's 3-0 win over Leicester City on March 16. He then went another six games before scoring again for the Reds.",
      "In desperate need of consistency, both collectively and individually next season, United will be unable to rely on the Dane to provide them with the regular goal-threat they will be in need of.",
      "And that is why their pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo makes such perfect sense. United are keen to bring the Cameroonian to Old Trafford and have already seen a £55million offer knocked back.",
      "United offered £45m up front and an additional £10m in add-ons. It is understood Brentford are holding out for a similar fee to the £62.5m United paid for Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "When analysing Mbeumo's numbers from the 2024/25 campaign, however, Brentford's stance is fully understandable. He scored 20 Premier League goals last term, only being outscored by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (29), Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak (23) and Manchester City ace Erling Haaland (22).",
      "Consistency was key to Mbeumo's achievement of reaching 20 Premier League goals, with his longest drought in front of goal amounting to only five games on a single occasion. That barren run covered the start of November through to the start of December.",
      "With the exception of that blip, Mbeumo never went more than three Premier League games without a goal during the campaign. Reflecting on his season's work, he admitted consistency was key to his success.",
      "\"Consistency is really important,\" Mbeumo said, speaking to BBC Sport Africa last month. \"If you want to have big ambitions you need to perform the whole season.",
      "\"I think I am still improving every day I put a foot on the pitch. I never put limits on myself.\"",
      "United's attack has been starved of a consistent goalscorer in recent seasons, meaning supporters will be hopeful, should a deal get over the line, that Mbeumo will be able to fix that particular concern.",
      "United are not trying to sign Mbeumo to lead their attack, with the addition of a No.9 still a leading priority, but they will be hopeful the Cameroonian's reliability will give them an extra shot in the arm."

      "Few players have mastered the art of scoring goals better than Napoli striker Victor Osimhen in recent seasons.",
      "The Manchester United-linked striker has been a reliable source of goals over the last few years, scoring 85 times since the beginning of the 2022/23 season. He spent last season on loan at Galatasaray and scored a very impressive 37 goals in just 41 appearances.",
      "Unsurprisingly, the Turkish club want to re-sign the Nigerian on a permanent basis this summer. In fact, they have already called on Osimhen to make a decision on his future as quickly as possible.",
      "Galatasaray vice-president Abdullah Kavukcu, speaking during the week, said: \"Osimhen must decide as soon as possible. He always asks us for time, we respect that, he has a family too, but time runs out.",
      "\"We have made a much higher offer than other European clubs and at the moment we are not negotiating other strikers. We are not thinking about plan B, we want Osimhen.\"",
      "Napoli are open to selling Osimhen this summer after he fell out with head coach Antonio Conte almost a year ago. Director Giovanni Manna admitted as far back as February, the Serie A champions want his future sorted out as quickly as possible.",
      "Amid their desperate need for a striker this summer, United have frequently been linked with the 26-year-old in recent months. Other clubs from across Europe and Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, who have been rejected by Osimhen, have also been circling.",
      "After gambling on potential with Rasmus Hojlund in 2023 and Joshua Zirkzee last summer, United need to sign a striker with a proven goalscoring record this summer. Osimhen ticks that particular box.",
      "The elephant in the room for United, though, is that they do not have an unlimited budget to turn to this summer. They have already spent £62.5million on Matheus Cunha and they may have to stump up a similar fee to extract Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford after recently seeing a £55m bid rebuffed.",
      "Player sales will be key to any further business United conduct this summer, meaning they are soon going to have to step up their efforts in the seller's market. United's transfer activity is currently in a bit of a lull, almost certainly impacted by the June 30 profit and sustainability rules (PSR) deadline, but the volume of activity is expected to increase come the start of July and the new financial year.",
      "United have a list of players they want to sell this summer, and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales. Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed he can leave at the right price.",
      "Garnacho was the subject of interest from Napoli in January and they saw a £40m offer turned down. North of £50m is a more realistic valuation of the Argentine.",
      "United are prepared to sell any player this summer and Rasmus Hojlund has attracted interest from Inter Milan. He joined United from Atalanta almost two years ago and regressed last season after a respectable debut campaign in M16.",
      "Napoli, over the last few days, have been linked with both Hojlund and Sancho, meaning United could exploit the Italian market once again to offload their unwanted talent. Italy has been a destination for several players departing Old Trafford in recent seasons, including Scott McTominay, Omari Forson, Nemanja Matic, Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku.",
      "Napoli are reputedly keen on him and the addition of a winger is thought to be a top priority for them this summer amid their need to replace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who joined Paris Saint-Germain in January. They also want a striker.",
      "With United open to selling Hojlund and Garnacho, while also actively looking to get Sancho off the books, they have options within their ranks who they could offer to Napoli in a player-plus-cash deal for Osimhen.",
      "It would help drive the price of the Nigerian down and it would be a win-win situation for everyone involved. United will struggle to find many strikers better than Osimhen who are available this summer, but getting a deal in place may require an alternative method."

      "The last time Manchester United had a season devoid of European football was also one of the last in-person squad photos the players assembled for.",
      "Looking back at that line-up in September 2014, the squad is larger than necessary for a season where United played a meagre 44 domestic matches. Ben Amos, Anderson, Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira and Anders Lindegaard are four inclusions by default.",
      "Amos and Lindegaard did not play all season. Pereira and Anderson each played twice and Lingard once. United got Amos, Anderson and Lindegaard off the books in 2015.",
      "Jonny Evans, Tyler Blackett, Robin van Persie, Angel di Maria, Rafael da Silva, Radamel Falcao, Darren Fletcher and Adnan Januzaj had gone when the squad reassembled in front of the Scoreboard End a year later. United had the luxury of cutting their losses on misfits and past-its without any financial ramifications back then.",
      "Ruben Amorim would probably scoff at the recommendation of 27 senior professionals. United are provisionally aiming for 26, which does not seem like much of a difference but is a logical number.",
      "Three of the 26 would be goalkeepers, so whittle that down to 23 outfield players and you have two XIs and three players as cover.",
      "Van Gaal actually used 38 players in his first season, a number skewed by the wholesale changes he made for the shocking League Cup thrashing by MK Dons in early August. Saidy Janko, Reece James, Marnick Vermijl and Nick Powell were all one-and-done for the campaign that balmy night.",
      "Injuries also forced Van Gaal's hand. Paddy McNair did not have his own Wikipedia page when he made his debut against West Ham United 11 days after the first team's class photo. Evans, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones were, of course, all out injured and Blackett suspended. Tom Thorpe, on the bench, came on to play 111 seconds and remained stranded on Nelson.",
      "Including the auxiliary options Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, the only survivor of the Van Gaal squad, Amorim has seven centre backs to pick in his back three next season. Few would have Shaw in the United second XI, never mind first XI.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Harry Amass are raw options on the left wing but they are a manageable pair for a sparser season. The versatile Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot are alternative options. Shaw's 27 appearances out of a possible 112 fixtures in the past two seasons place him at the back of the pecking order at centre half and left wing.",
      "United are light in midfield. Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo can both play there and the former may well transition to a deeper role for the latter years of his competitive club career.",
      "But the specialists are Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and Toby Collyer. Amorim seems to consider Mainoo as an option further afield, Ugarte was dropped for the Europa League final, United have tried and failed to shift Casemiro and Collyer's three starts have come against teams from Romania, Scotland and League One.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Amad and Mason Mount are three natural fits to go into the two 10s behind the striker. The absence of a new striker is glaring but United wanted one as early as this month before Liam Delap opted for Chelsea over Cheshire.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is multi-functional and only Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland outscored him in the Premier League last term. Mbeumo is an attacker but has to be the upgrade on the right wing.",
      "United held discussions with the representatives of Sporting winger Geovany Quenda before he too chose Chelsea. Quenda is a left-footed winger by trade. As is Mbeumo.",
      "Six United players broke the 50-appearance mark in a 60-game season in 2024-25. Mbeumo started in 45 consecutive Premier League games for Brentford and completed 90 minutes in all but two. United already have durable players who can complete the entirety of one match once a week, which has to further reduce the core squad size.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee's form and rapport with supporters comfortably trump Rasmus Hojlund's this calendar year, even though the Dutchman missed nine of the final ten games. As an alternative '10' or a support striker, Zirkzee has more merit as a squad player than Hojlund, who was dropped by Denmark coach Brian Riemer this month after one goal in 15 games for the national team.",
      "Chido Obi's exposure at first-team level since February and his development in the youth team make it logical to keep him in the building next season. He is a purer striker than Zirkzee and often looks more natural than Hojlund.",
      "Obi, Collyer and Shaw would be the logical 'cover'. Two academy graduates still learning their trade and the longest servant who has outstayed his welcome but is unsellable.",
      "There is a clear plan for United to streamline their attack and mould it in Amorim's image, but considerable fat to cut off. Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho is a weekly wage bill north of £1m.",
      "And United would not want any of them in a squad photo.",
      "Possible United squad 2025-25",

Cunha has been signed to occupy the left-sided No.10 spot in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and Mbeumo could operate from either the right-sided No.10 position or right wing-back.",
      "It should be stressed United are yet to reach an agreement with Brentford for Mbeumo, who was the subject of a £55m bid from the Reds earlier this month, but they are still hopeful of making a breakthrough. He has informed confidants he wants to move to M16 this summer.",
      "If United are successful in their efforts and Mbeumo is extracted from the Gtech Community Stadium, they will be two thirds of the way towards fixing their attack, with the addition of a centre-forward still a leading priority.",
      "After getting a deal in place for Cunha on the opening day of the transfer window (June 1), United immediately increased expectation levels, meaning supporters would have hoped for more deals to follow quickly.",
      "The news vacuum of the past week or so, however, has highlighted that was never likely to be the case. Patience will be key.",
      "The transfer window can be tricky to navigate, particularly in its early stages, and the upcoming profit and sustainability rules (PSR) deadline of June 30 is undoubtedly playing on the minds of several clubs.",
      "But having signed Cunha, lodged a bid for Mbeumo and expressed their hunger to sign Liam Delap prior to him settling on a move to Chelsea, United have not lacked ambition at the start of the window. They want to move at speed and make up for last summer's mistakes."

Napoli are reportedly among those interested in Sancho, who is said to be open to a move to Italy, even if it means lowering his wage demands.",
      "And according to Sky Sport Italy, Napoli are leading the race to sign him. They claim that Sancho's preference is to join Antonio Conte's team, as they were the first side to express an interest this summer.",
      "But Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has appeared to suggest a switch to the Italian club will not happen, unless he lowers his existing demands.",
      "\"Our offer is clear, we will not pay Sancho's requested salary,\" he said via journalist Yagiz Sabuncuoglu on X.",
      "United want to secure a similar fee to the one that was agreed with Chelsea, in the region of £25million, despite what was a disappointing spell in west London.",
      "Sancho scored five goals and provided 10 assists in 41 matches for the Blues, who ended the season winning the UEFA Conference League and finishing in the top-four."

Despite impressing during his stint in the Midlands, a permanent move does not appear to be on the cards amid ongoing speculation over a potential switch abroad.",
      "La Liga champions Barcelona have been heavily tipped to move for the 27-year-old, although their pursuit of Spanish winger Nico Williams could make a deal for Rashford less likely. That said, the United forward seemingly hasn't given up on the idea of joining the Catalan giants, with his latest comments coming across as a clear come-and-get-me plea.",

The 17-year-old, who plays on the opposite flank, has enjoyed a meteoric rise following Spain’s Euro 2024 triumph and is now regarded as one of the most exciting young talents in world football.",
      "\"Yeah for sure,\" Rashford replied, when asked about the prospect of lining up with Yamal. \"Everybody in the world wants to play with the best, you know, so hopefully we’ll see.\"",
      "The United outcast now faces an anxious wait to have his future resolved before the squad returns for pre-season training next month. United are set to play a fixture in Sweden before heading to the US for friendlies against Bournemouth, West Ham, and Everton.",
      "The second transfer window of the summer will remain open until September 1, shortly after the 2025/26 Premier League season gets underway. Rashford remains under contract at Old Trafford until 2028, but reports suggest a fee of around £40 million could be enough to get a deal done."

      "This time next year Ewan Sharp will be at the centre of an historic World Cup.",
      "He could even come up against a few familiar faces from his Manchester United days - perhaps a meeting with Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes, or facing off against his mentor Ralf Rangnick, now in charge of Austria.",
      "Sharp spent a year at Old Trafford, working alongside Rangnick, and is now part of the coaching staff at Canada, who are co-hosts for next summer's World Cup.",
      "Right now the Canadians are involved in the Gold Cup and face Curaçao in their second group game tonight having eased past Honduras 6-0 in their opener.",
      "Canada, managed by former Leeds United boss Jesse Marsch, are one of the favourites for the tournament alongside their co-hosts USA and Mexico. Sharp, 32, will hope this summer brings success and that the formula can be repeated on the world stage in 12 months' time.",
      "\"The Gold Cup in a lot of ways replicates the World Cup and we want to use that as a learning and an experience. I think in the last year we have learned a lot about our players and our group and the squad depth is improving.\"",
      "Sharp's role within the staff set-up is a hybrid of analysis and on-pitch coaching. It's one he relishes with his background in video analysis lending itself to an analytical role while his desire to one day be a manager means he relishes the coaching aspect.",
      "\"Day to day I am involved in scouting our players, watching their matches, looking at players we should consider calling in, looking at our core guys,\" Sharp explains.",
      "\"As well as being responsible for the opposition match planning and prep and thinking about ways in which we can play against them.",
      "\"In camp, a lot of that prep work is done, so I am a bit more free to help with training planning and coaching and working with individual players.\"",
      "Sharp's rise to the role started in the Red Bull organisation, where he first met Marsch and also Rangnick. It was the German who took Sharp to United.",
      "It was one of many difficult periods in United's recent history with the club having axed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and, unsure of where to go next, turned to Rangnick and his team as an interim option.",
      "An initial honeymoon period saw United beaten just twice in 17 games - albeit one was a penalty shoot out defeat to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup - but after a derby day thumping at Manchester City and a Champions League exit to Atletico Madrid and with qualification for next season's elite competition slipping away, the wheels came off. United won just three times in their final 14 matches. A deal to bring Erik ten Hag in for the following campaign was announced in April and Sharp admits it became a tough sell for the coaching staff.",
      "\"Things started off in a good way, I felt we had some progress,\" said the affable and conversational Sharp from his home in Florida. \"As the season went on, when certain objectives were out of reach and we'd been knocked out of the Champions League by Atletico, once that was gone and it became more and more difficult to reach the top four, the environment and the feeling was one of disappointment.",
      "\"There was a bit of a slide and perhaps that same appetite for what we were bringing to the table disappeared a bit. When you are competing for something you are on the edge and every player is so ready for it, and as soon as that goes... you see it at end of seasons when teams slide a bit.",
      "\"We hit a bit of that and the fact that we weren't full-time staff, it was hard for us to put something on the table because it had already been announced that Ten Hag was coming in.",
      "\"We couldn't say 'if you do this, you can be a part of this, and we are building this'. We are now managing it until the next guy comes in and that becomes a challenge.",
      "\"Was it viewed unfairly? The expectations at Man United are as high as they can be, and rightly so. We knew that going into it, anything short of a really good winning record, and trying to push for the Champions League and to have a good run in the Champions League, that was the objective. We were disappointed we didn't achieve that but there were a lot of challenges going on.\"",
      "Rangnick famously said United needed 'open heart surgery' in a quote that didn't sit well at the time but has perhaps become somewhat prophetic. United lifted two trophies under Ten Hag and reached the Europa League final last season, but the latest rebuild under Ruben Amorim is only just beginning.",
      "For Sharp, the chapter at Old Trafford was a privilege and a learning curve. The chance to work with elite players at an elite club, even if it was a difficult situation from the get-go amid poor form, a club at a crossroads and fan perception or Rangnick and an interim coaching team.",
      "\"Arriving at Man United was a big responsibility but I kept telling myself that Ralf had brought me here for a reason,\" reflects Sharp.",
      "\"I might not know everything about the game but I now what Ralf wants. I don't have all the solutions but I can help Ralf communicate his message. The players were receptive to it and open to it.",
      "\"I am not trying to help Bruno take a free kick but I can help him understand what the manager is asking of him or I can sit with him and say things I saw from the game and have a discussion, and perhaps help them see that for us and how Ralf wants us to play, this is why we want to see it this way. Most of the time players want to be better and to help the team so they will fit in with what the manager wants.",
      "\"It was a very difficult situation that we went into. I am so grateful for the opportunity but it was a challenging environment to be in. Partly because of where the club was at in that moment, but also in the way in which we came in. We came in on the back of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who you could feel was loved by the people inside the club. Everyone loved him, from the staff in the canteen to everyone.",
      "\"We came in and are coming in for an interim. When Ralf talked about that open heart surgery, one of his greatest strengths is creating a continuity and a vision for a club. Ralf knows how to put people in positions to build a whole club so that at least it works to a vision. And for Ralf to do that he has to be given the reins. He was recognising what a lot of the problems were and a lot of the things that could be improved to get it back to where it should be.\"",
      "United are not yet there, three years on from Sharp's departure. The hope is that under Amorim the Reds can embark on a successful journey back to the top. Sharp himself has been on quite the journey in football to reach the top.",
      "He left his native Scotland to go to America on a football scholarship at university and became interested in coaching. A friend introduced him to video analysis and Sharp dived into the analytical world and began doing analysis for the college he was attending to do his masters. An opportunity opened up in New York with the Red Bulls second team and it was there that Sharp met Rangnick.",
      "\"I have been lucky, lucky to meet the right people, for them to open doors for me,\" he adds, somewhat modestly. \"But then I know when I step through that door I can add value and contribute. Each step, you get hungry for the next environment.",
      "\"It (my journey) is a bit unconventional and a bit different but I am inspired by others. Fabian Hurzeler at Brighton is an example, he didn't have a big playing career and is a similar age to me and is performing really well in the Premier League with a great club.",
      "\"I am ambitious, hungry and believe I have some value to bring to the table and I have always trusted and back myself, so I have never been afraid to give my opinion which is important, but always in the right way.",
      "\"For me (being a head coach) is an aim, I am ambitious and hungry and every time I take a step up I am thinking about what is next.",
      "\"I love being in Europe and England and being close to my family. Having my mum and dad come to games at Old Trafford and see me down there was special for me. Those are memories I cherish.",
      "\"I would love to get back to England, but I don't feel in a rush to get there, but I want to keep developing and learning.\""

      "'By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail'. Never has a quote been resembling a football club than this one with Manchester United and their transfer business.",
      "United are back to square one this summer after investing in Erik ten Hag this time last year. After the board decided parting ways with Ten Hag was the right decision, the Dutchman instead signed a new contract and was backed in the transfer market.",
      "Despite previous deals not working, the newly-formed recruitment team brought in two more players that had previously worked with Ten Hag with Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui. Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee were signed and the priority position, a No.6, was not through the door until the third game of the season in the shape of Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked and United went on to suffer their worst season in 51 years with a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League. Some would argue that United opting to keep Ten Hag when he should have gone was never going to work but the failure to get in the right players early in the market certainly played a huge role.",
      "12 months later and United are faced with a similar problem. Today (June 21) marks one month to the day that Ruben Amorim's men suffered defeat in the Europa League final to Tottenham, their rock bottom. It's also one month until the first pre-season game against Leeds United in Sweden.",
      "At the start of the month, it looked as though United were going to move with power and authority in the transfer window. Matheus Cunha's arrival from Wolves was the first of many hopeful signings this summer and Bryan Mbeumo rapidly became the next priority.",
      "However, going into the final week of June, United are in the exact same spot as they were after Cunha's was announced. Mbeumo isn't through the door, for whatever reason, and their hunt for a new prolific striker hasn't gathered pace. For United and the people at the club, that isn't a problem.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" Omar Berrada recently told The Athletic. \"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "Getting Mbeumo and a new centre-forward before the start of pre-season is the dream scenario for Amorim. Following a difficult start to life at United, the Portuguese knows more than anyone that he needs to get his team well-drilled during pre-season before the start of the season.",
      "However, it isn't just incomings being delayed that is a problem. There are plenty of players who could be sold this summer but the four of Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are the big-hitters. Unfortunately, United are no closer to raising funds.",
      "Sancho is attracting interest from Italy while Antony is understood to be prepared to take a 30 per cent wage cut to leave the club on a permanent basis. United require a fee of £32.58m to avoid a loss on the Brazilian under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability regulation.",
      "A recent report from ESPN has suggested that Rashford is planning to return to United training next month if an exit has not been agreed. The same can be presumed about Sancho, Antony and Garnacho, meaning there's a real chance they could be included in the pre-season schedule. Players who appear to have no future in Amorim’s plans being part of the squad isn’t the best preparation.",
      "Player sales is something that United have struggled to master in recent years. Scott McTominay's switch to Napoli for £25.7m is the club's sixth most expensive departure. If you wanted an idea of how poor United are at cashing-in, Liverpool are about to sell Jarell Quansah - not a first-choice under Arne Slot - for around £34m.",
      "The Reds have a good relationship with Bayer Leverkusen after recently signing Florian Wirtz but the fact that they are about to get that fee for a defender who hasn't been superb speaks volumes of their ability to raise funds through player sales.",
      "It's something that United need to work on. Selling the four players is a must before pre-season and failure to do so will be a major contributing factor to Amorim's fate this season. By failing to prepare for their biggest season in years, United are preparing to fail."

In their golden era, United always scored a lot of goals from set-pieces but haven’t had a proper striker for many seasons. Nowadays, teams have small, quick strikers or a false forward because there is an obsession for possession of the ball.",
      "“Beto represents the typical old style, because of his physique, power and work-rate — plus he is very fast. When Moyes went to Everton he showed what a handful he is for defenders to stop. He’d be like Amorim’s ace up his sleeve in a game of poker.”"

      "It had been assumed that Williams’ expected move to Barcelona would end Rashford’s hopes of joining Hansi Flick’s side, but this may not be the case.",
      "A report on Sunday claimed Barcelona are looking to sign both players because Flick ‘values versatile players’ and Rashford would be useful due to his ability to operate in various attacking roles.",

      "Eager to add ‘captains and leaders’, Amorim is described as a ‘long-term admirer’ of the Villa shot-stopper, which may urge him to change his stance on retaining Onana as his first choice.",
      "But Villa’s £40m asking price may well prove to be a barrier for United, with the club in the market for new players in multiple positions after their worst season in living memory and with not a great deal of spare cash to spend given their failure to qualify for Europe as a result of that dreadful campaign.",
      "With that in mind, they’ve reportedly made an opening bid of €15m [£12.8m] for Lunin, who impressed for Los Blancos last season as he covered for the injured Thibaut Courtois, but has found himself back on the sidelines this term following the Belgium international’s return to full fitness.",
      "Lunin recently extended his Madrid contract to 2030 but did so ‘on the condition of reviewing his situation at the end of the season’, which prompted United to hold ‘conversations’ with Lunin’s agent, Jorge Mendes, and make the bid, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "That opening offer has been ‘rejected’ by the La Liga giants, who reportedly value the 26-year-old at €20m [£17m].",
      "There’s also said to be interest from AC Milan in Lunin as ‘a new round of talks is expected’ between Chelsea and the Serie A side over a deal for Mike Maignan after the Blues made a £12.8m bid for the France international which fell short of Milan’s £20m valuation.",

      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai.

      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",

      "There is a surprise Premier League candidate leading the race to sign Arsenal and Manchester United-linked Juventus striker Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "The Serbian international is reportedly available for transfer this summer, having failed to live up to the £70million fee the Old Lady paid Fiorentina in 2022.",
      "Arsenal were extremely interested in signing the 25-year-old during that winter window, but he understandably chose to stay in Italy.",
      "He may live to regret that decision, with Mikel Arteta’s side in a far healthier state than Juventus — though he has at least picked up a trophy with the Serie A giants.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Liverpool eye England star as Mbeumo race tightens…",
      "It’s been reported that Vlahovic could be available for as little as £40m, with his contract set to expire next June.",
      "There’s interest from Italian rivals AC Milan, while Manchester United have also been thrown into the mix.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is desperate to sign an out-and-out centre-forward amid the struggles of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, and United could do a lot worse than Vlahovic at that price.",
      "And incredibly, a fresh report from our friends over at TEAMtalk says Juventus’ asking price could drop as low as €30m (£25.6m).",
      "Transfer expert Rudy Galetti claims Igor Tudor’s side will make one final attempt to renew Vlahovic’s contract, but if he doesn’t sign, he’ll be available for around that figure this summer.",
      "Vlahovic earns over £200,000 a week in Turin — wages too steep for Milan — though Juve are still willing to sell within Serie A.",
      "The striker’s representatives are shopping him around and have already attracted plenty of Premier League interest.",
      "Surprisingly, Nottingham Forest have emerged as the ‘favourites’ to sign Vlahovic as Man United consider other options.",
      "His ‘heart is set on a move to the Premier League’, and it’s Forest who are ‘leading the race for his signature’.",
      "They’re described as ‘the most concrete option’ for the Serbian, who ‘will only join Milan if no English club presents a convincing project — including in terms of wages’.",
      "He is in ‘no rush’ at the moment and is awaiting contact from ‘top Premier League clubs’.",
      "Forest will play in the Europa Conference League next season after finishing seventh in the Premier League, and the signing of Vlahovic would be a real statement of intent.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo has been rewarded for an incredible season with a new contract.",
      "Having guided the club into Europe for the first time since 1995/96, Nuno said: “I am delighted to be able to continue our journey at this fantastic football club.",
      "“Since we arrived at Forest, we have worked extremely hard to create a special bond between the players, the fans and everyone at the club, which helped us achieve great things last season.",

      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe know Liverpool like Isak. Everyone likes Isak. But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",
      "",
      "19) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nWith Andre Onana needing punted and United focusing on other positions, this one feels unlikely. It’s a weird one; we don’t think it’s a load of rubbish, but it’s simply unrealistic right now.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nThe Serbia striker, linked with Arsenal since the womb, has apparently approached United directly because he fancies a move to Old Trafford. United, for their part, are quite receptive, especially having learned Vlahovic would cost just shy of £40million, which is less than Gyokeres. Keep an eye on this one.",
      "",
      "17) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nA move abroad is surely the plan for Sancho, but with so many United players, his salary will make any permanent departure tricky. Still, the source (Sky) is not a bad one…",
      "",
      "16) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are ‘confident of providing Rashford with an ideal stage to rebuild his career’. But they don’t want to pay for him – yet. Of course United want a permanent sale but the chances are the best they might get is a loan with an obligation.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Rodrigo Muniz – Fulham to Leeds\nLeeds have gone hard for Muniz – but not hard enough. Fulham rejected a £32million proposal, with £26million guaranteed, and the Cottagers want it to be known that they won’t sell the forward unless they get an offer they can’t refuse. One Leeds would be daft to make.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nThe Seagulls forward is intent on leaving Brighton to take the next step but apparently, wherever he goes, he wants to be the first choice. Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation, which won’t be easy if the Seagulls see Newcastle bank a massive fee for Isak.",
      "",
      "13) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid this week, but they are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nThe clubs are at least £15m apart on valuation according to latest reports, with Bournemouth understandably reluctant to see Zabarnyi follow Dean Huijsen out of the club in the same summer. The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",
      "",
      "11) Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nAtletico Madrid made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing, but their participation in Gianni Infantino’s wet dream may hold things up. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "10) Son Heung-min – Tottenham to Saudi Arabia\nIt was widely reported that Spurs are ready to sell their skipper, but only after they have milked for every last penny by parading him on pre-season tour in his homeland. Levy, that. Apparently, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr and Al-Qadsiah are all prepared to pay £34million for Son, who is entering the final year of his contract at Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. The Ivorian is only 21 years young and played 31 times as Sporting won the Portuguese top flight last season. He’d be a brilliant Guehi replacement.",
      "",
      "7) 🔽 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo only had eyes for United before Frank’s appointment at Spurs. United remained confident of getting their man, and some reports suggest they have submitted a second offer. But Brentford have got what they want – a bidding war. Beyond that, we’re all guessing, but of the two interested parties, United are probably the most concerned right now.",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, with both keen to move to the Emirates, but they are having more trouble charming their clubs. Sporting’s stance has irked Gyokeres to the point he’s not willing to meet to clear the air and the Swede could go on strike to force a move when he returns from St Tropez. Juventus have been turned down in favour of Arsenal, who may reasonably feel they can land Gyokeres for slightly less than they may have to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham, and while he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus, there is momentum gathering again around Spurs’ interest, which would allow the forward to remain in London, playing for a manager he appreciates.",
      "",
      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. There was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Everyone reckons it’s done. Zubimendi is in London and Arsenal have always been confident.",
      "",
      "2) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nThis seemed to be done, but now we are told that Liverpool and Bournemouth ‘remain in talks’. Given the Cherries have signed a replacement, we presume it’s the very fine details being discussed and Kerkez will be heading to Anfield imminently.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nAfter rumours died down, they have ramped right back up again. And just like that, Quansah has reportedly agreed personal terms with Erik ten Hag’s side and is expected to join for at least £30m."

      "33) Josh Sargent (Norwich)\nAmerican international Sargent would be next to Rashica on this list if it wasn’t for some decent Championship form in a dysfunctional team. Norwich went down in 2021/22 as Sargent scored two in 26 Premier League appearances, both of which came in the same game. He has scored 44 in 98 in the second tier.",
      "",
      "32) Timo Werner (Chelsea)\nThe huge £50m fee Chelsea paid to sign Werner was a huge waste of money.",
      "",
      "31) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nThis guy joined with huge expectations and for a respectable £51m but injuries made his debut season hard to judge. When fully fit, he can’t get in the starting XI over Nicolas Jackson. Expected to leave this summer.",
      "",
      "30) Donyell Malen (Aston Villa)\nMalen cost Villa a little over £21m in January and instantly upset him by signing Marcus Rashford and including him in their Champions League squad over the Dutchman. Next season should be more joyous.",
      "",
      "29) Wataru Endo (Liverpool)\nHard to knock £15m for a player of Endo’s quality; he is a solid rotational option.",
      "",
      "28) Leon Bailey (Aston Villa)\nSigned from Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen for a cool £25m in 2021, Bailey failed to hit the heights expected of him in his first year for Villa. We said ‘2023/24 is his last chance to prove himself at Villa Park’ and he did just that. Bailey was fantastic. But he’s now reportedly surplus to requirements.",
      "",
      "27) Matthijs de Ligt (Manchester United)\nWe don’t think De Ligt was that bad for Man United last season. He did have a mad few minutes at Anfield, mind.",
      "",
      "26) Robin Koch (Leeds)\nKoch is decent in the air, comfortable on the ball, versatile, rarely injured, but not the most convincing defender in the world.",
      "",
      "25) Mathys Tel (Tottenham)\nHis six months on loan at Spurs was pretty disappointing, but then Spurs were historically s**t. They recently signed him permanently from Bayern.",
      "",
      "24) Mark Flekken (Brentford)\nFlekken was fine for Brentford. Not outstanding but not bad by any stretch. He made the most saves across Europe’s top five leagues last season.",
      "",
      "23) Brajan Gruda (Brighton)\nBrighton paid £25m for the young German, who is beginning to show why on a more frequent basis.",
      "",
      "22) Marcel Sabitzer (Manchester United)\nSigned on loan for the second half of 22/23, Sabitzer filled a gap for Erik ten Hag and barely put a foot wrong. His form at Borussia Dortmund and for Austria at Euro 2024 will have been hard for Man Utd to stomach. They could have had him for £15m!",
      "",
      "21) Tyler Adams (Leeds)\nLeeds made some questionable signings before their relegation season, but Tyler Adams was a brilliant one. For every Brenden Aaronson, there is an Adams and Willy Gnonto, as the famous saying goes.",
      "The American international left for Bournemouth after his single year at Leeds made it clear that he is far too good for the Championship.",
      "",
      "20) Moussa Niakhate (Nottingham Forest)\nOne of 400 signings made by Nottingham Forest before 2022/23, Niakhate left Mainz – where he was captain – to take on his first challenge in England.",
      "Niakhate was pretty solid for Forest but not a £27m player, we don’t think. That is what they got for him from Lyon, making it £47m in total for him and Mangala. Good going, that. Especially when you consider Niakhate only cost Forest around £8m.",
      "",
      "19) Chris Richards (Crystal Palace)\nRichards joined Palace for around £10m in July 2022 and has been pretty solid whenever called upon.",
      "",
      "18) Noussair Mazraoui (Manchester United)\nWe still can’t believe Man United made a good decision in the transfer market.",
      "",
      "17) Kevin Schade (Brentford)\nBrentford paid around £20m to sign the 23-year-old from Freiburg and after a difficult spell with injuries, Schade has kicked on. He recorded 11 goals and two assists in the Premier League last term.",
      "",
      "16) Demarai Gray (Everton)\nEverton got Gray for a measly £1.5m and he did not live up to that price tag. In a good way, this time.",
      "",
      "15) Kai Havertz (Chelsea)\nStruggled when he joined, then scored the winning goal in a Champions League final, became even worse, but left for £65m. That goal and the fact Chelsea recouped the vast majority of the £72m for Havertz sees him as high as 15th.",
      "",
      "14) Hee-chan Hwang (Wolves)\nYou know what you will get from Hwang, but he has been poor for too long now and drops down here.",
      "",
      "13) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City)\nCity landed Ortega on a free transfer in the summer of 2022. As far as back-up goalkeepers go, the German is one of the best in the world.",
      "",
      "12) Dominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool)\nSzoboszlai was really disappointing before Arne Slot came along. He was crucial in Liverpool’s Premier League title win. But he now has the most expensive attacking midfielder of all time to compete for a starting spot with.",
      "",
      "11) Taiwo Awoniyi (Nottingham Forest)\n“Taiwo Awoniyi will score two league goals all season”. That is what this idiot said in our 2022/23 pre-season predictions.",
      "Awoniyi proved me wrong, scoring a very respectable 10 in 27. Six of those came in the last four Premier League matches of the season and went a very long way to keeping Forest in the top flight. In those final four fixtures, without former Union Berlin striker Awoniyi’s goals, the Reds would have got one point. They hugely benefited from his goals and picked up eight from a possible 12.",
      "Those goals are the reason why Forest will play in Europe next season and not the Championship.",
      "",
      "10) Maxence Lacroix (Crystal Palace)\nReplacing Joachim Andersen was always going to be difficult but Palace have done exceptionally well with Lacroix. He makes losing Marc Guehi a little less scary.",
      "",
      "9) Thiago (Liverpool)\nThiago was an outstanding technician and has decided to call it a day on his playing career last summer after another year riddled with injuries.",
      "Despite his fitness issues, Thiago was still a good signing; especially considering the Reds only paid £20m to sign him from Bayern Munich.",
      "",
      "8) Manuel Akanji (Manchester City)\nNobody really expected much from Akanji when he joined from Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund but he quickly proved he is a top player.",
      "The Swiss international has played superbly as a central defender and even more impressively as a full-back.",
      "",
      "7) Micky van de Ven (Tottenham)\nVan de Ven’s pace is frightening. He can defend as well, which helps. Those hamstrings though…",
      "",
      "6) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City)\nIt’s early days, but Marmoush looks like a very special player.",
      "",
      "5) Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nMateta cost close to £10m in January 2022 and took a while to get going, but when he did, bloody hell, he has been difficult to stop.",
      "He is loving life under Oliver Glasner, finishing the 23/24 season with 16 league goals after scoring two in his first 19 appearances in 22/23 and eight in 77 in total. He then bagged 14 in 24/25 and helped Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "4) Ibrahima Konate (Liverpool)\nLike Thiago, Konate does have his injury troubles. Nevertheless, when he is fit Konate forms a terrific partnership with Virgil van Dijk. £36m = bargain.",
      "",
      "3) Ryan Gravenberch (Liverpool)\nLiverpool wanted Martin Zubimendi last summer and after failing to convince him to leave Real Sociedad, they stuck with Gravenberch. He quickly blossomed into one of the best deep-lying midfielders in Europe. His level of consistency and availability gives him the edge over Konate.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol (Manchester City)\nBig, big money for Gvardiol (£77m) but he will be worth it in the long run.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City)\nCity should do business with Dortmund more often. Akanji has been excellent, Ilkay Gundogan’s £21m move in 2016 turned out to be one of the best signings in the club’s history, and Haaland has been…ridiculously impressive.",
      "Signed to win City the Champions League, he did just that at the first attempt as his new team completed the Treble. A whopping 52 goals in 53 games in his debut season was a simply outrageous return.",
      "He now has one of the biggest contracts in world football after City tied him down for 115 months. Cheeky.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Atalanta – £38.19m\nNo big-money show-off signings but three players aged 23, 24 and 25 in preparation for the usual round of summer exits.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Brighton – £51.3m\nPerhaps in an effort to ensure Fabian Hurzeler has enough of an age gap over at least some of his squad, Brighton have spent a fair whack on three exciting teenagers from Sunderland, Daejeon Hana Citizen and Olympiacos, and the 21-year-old Diego Coppola.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund – £52.48m\nThey used the Club World Cup transfer window to bring in Jobe Bellingham and Yan Couto and they could add Jason Sancho.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £62.5m\nThey have completed the most expensive transfer of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. We’re not sure where all this money is coming from…",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £97.6m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £102.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £131m\nThe Wirtz deal alone would be enough to propel Liverpool to top spot at this time, without having to even remember the Jeremie Frimpong deal. Unlikely they’ve concluded their spending, either."

      "Sancho made 31 Premier League appearances on loan for Chelsea in 2024-25 after his United career stalled amid apparent tension with then-manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "And, with Ruben Amorim and United on the hunt for attacking upgrades after a thoroughly disappointing season in his absence, Sancho is wanted by a number of clubs who believe the Red Devils will want or even need to sell the England winger.",
      "Aston Villa and Napoli are among several clubs linked with a move for Sancho but Sheth reports that Juventus, who agreed a loan deal with United last summer before the player opted to stay closer to home.",
      "“The Italian club will formally approach United if they believe a move is realistic and they are in touch with Sancho’s representatives over personal terms.”",
      "Sancho decided to spend last season in London but is no stranger to embracing new horizons in pursuit of progress in his career.",
      "In 2017, the former Watford junior left Manchester City and signed for German Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund and played more than 100 league games there before returning to Manchester with the Red Devils in 2021.",
      "United loaned Sancho out twice under Ten Hag. His 2024 calendar year was split between a return to Dortmund and the start of his stint with Chelsea.",
      "Sancho’s England career has stalled since he joined United and was clearly frustrated when Ten Hag dropped him and went public with his criticisms of the winger’s performance in training. Sancho was repeatedly left out of squads and, eventually, sent into exile.",
      "Juventus will take Sancho’s previous adaptation to new surroundings into account if they pursue their interest in the 25-year-old.",
      "Sancho was one of Dortmund’s leading lights at times in his initial four seasons in the Bundesliga, scoring 50 goals in 137 appearances in all competitions for the North Rhine-Westphalia side including two in their DFB-Pokal final win against RB Leipzig in 2021.",
      "There were eight English players in Serie A last season including former Newcastle United defender Lloyd Kelly at Juventus, where he has now signed permanently.",
      "Scotland international Scott McTominay, Sancho’s former United teammate, was named the Serie A MVP after leading the Partenopei to their fourth Scudetto.",
      "Sheth reports that a reunion with McTominay or a second English summer signing for Juve would have to be in the form of a permanent transfer rather than a third loan, with United preferring to allow Sancho to leave once and for all.",
      "They are understood to be demanding a fee in the region of £25m for the winger.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star has reached an ‘agreement’ to leave the Premier League giants for Serie A champions Napoli.",
      "Manchester United could be under threat from the same European giant for two of their players, as they are ‘making an attempt’ to land a second forward.",
      "The Ballon d’Or has become A Thing for modern players but transfer decisions are now being made based on winning it, with Liverpool heavily impacted.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are involved in a ‘three-way Premier League battle’ to sign Manchester United outcast Jadon Sancho.",

      "Florian Wirtz has become the most expensive attacking midfielder in history by an absurd margin – here’s a rundown of the top 20.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – £100m/€116m (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, June 2025)\nAs statements of intent from defending champions go, it’s a chunky one as Liverpool add the most expensive AM in history to a squad that cruised to Premier League glory last season.",
      "",
      "2) James Rodriguez – £63.2m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nNever before has a shop window been so successfully deployed as when Rodriguez and his giant pet grasshopper dominated the 2014 World Cup so thoroughly that Real Madrid couldn’t help but make the Colombian the fourth most expensive footballer ever at the time. His next permanent club being Everton remains hilarious.",
      "",
      "3) Thomas Lemar – £63m/€70m (Monaco to Atletico Madrid, June 2018)\nWith failed club-record bids from Arsenal and Liverpool in his back pocket, Lemar took his eternal search for justice to Spain and Diego Simeone has not let him go since.",
      "",
      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",
      "",
      "7) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "8) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",
      "",
      "9) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",
      "",
      "10) Otavio – £50.5m/€60m (Porto to Al-Nassr, August 2023)\nA star of the Saudi Arabia summer transfer window that was, Otavio has fared well enough but rumours persist over a return to Europe.",
      "",
      "11) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",
      "",
      "12) Teun Koopmeiners – £46.1m/€54.7m (Atalanta to Juventus, August 2024)\nShortly after being crowned a Europa League winner, Koopmeiners made the move one place up the Serie A table to accompany The Old Lady on their continued hopeful journey towards relevance.",
      "",
      "13) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",
      "",
      "14) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "15) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "16) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "17) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",
      "",
      "18) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "19) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways.",
      "",
      "20) James Rodriguez – £38.5m/€45m (Porto to Monaco, May 2013)\nLong before a Galactico future could be considered, Rodriguez was moving to newly-minted Monaco as the more expensive part of a double transfer with Joao Moutinho. The Colombian scored nine goals and assisted 13 in his only Ligue Un season."

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",
      "",
      "Wesley Moraes – £22m (Club Brugge, June 2019)\nOllie Watkins – £28m, rising to £33m (Brentford, September 2020)\nEmi Buendia – £30m, rising to £38m (Norwich, June 2021)\nMoussa Diaby – £43.2m, rising to £51.9m (Bayer Leverkusen, July 2023)\nAmadou Onana – £50m (Everton, July 2024)",
      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal. They then somehow sold the Frenchman for a profit, which allowed them to break their transfer record for the Everton and Belgium midfielder.",

      "Six years is a big old gap between record buys, but selling Dominic Solanke to Tottenham for a small fortune enabled them to reinvest in Evanilson, who pushed Tyrone Mings off this list.",

      "The previous two record signings bumped off this Brentford list by more recent deals were Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney; the hope is that Igor Thiago can have anything close to their success. A series of horrendous injuries limiting him to eight Premier League games (no goals) was a sub-optimal start.",

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood.

      "2025 AFCON takes place in Morocco between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026; Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea and Spurs are all set to lose key players for a number of potentially pivotal Premier League games during the tournament; Arsenal & Newcastle have no players competing",
      "Thursday 19 June 2025 20:30, UK",
      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",
      "And so these Premier League clubs will be missing a number of players for, potentially, several crucial fixtures at an integral part of next season:",
      "Mohamed Salah will captain Egypt at the tournament, meaning the Premier League champions will be without last season's FWA Footballer of the Year for a critical juncture of their title defence.",
      "The forward contributed an incredible 29 goals and 18 assists to help Arne Slot's side win the 2024/25 Premier League and given he suffered a debilitating hamstring injury while playing for Egypt at the 2023/24 AFCONs that seriously impacted Liverpool's title challenge that season, Reds head coach Arne Slot will be praying his star man comes back fit from Morocco.",
      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",
      "Tottenham vs Liverpool, December 20Liverpool vs Wolves, December 27Liverpool vs Leeds United - December 30Fulham vs Liverpool - January 3Arsenal vs Liverpool - January 7Liverpool vs Burnley - January 17",
      "Pep Guardiola is set to be without both Egypt striker Omar Marmoush and summer-signing Rayan Ait Nouri during next season's AFCON.",
      "Marmoush made an instant impact after moving to the Etihad from Eintracht Frankfurt in January, scoring seven goals in just 16 Premier League games, while City's new Algeria left-back is expected to play a key role for Guardiola's team next season.",
      "And that means City could be without both players for these league encounters, including the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on January 17, were either nation to make it as far as the semi-finals:",
      "Man City vs West Ham - December 20Nottingham Forest vs Man City - December 27Sunderland vs Man City - December 30Man City vs Chelsea - January 3Man City vs Brighton - January 7Man Utd vs Man City - January 17",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim could be missing goalkeeper Andre Onana [Cameroon], right-back Noussair Mazraoui [Morocco] and forward Amad Diallo [Ivory Coast] all for a key month of his first full campaign in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "If Bryan Mbeumo does complete a move from Brentford this summer, United will also be without their new Cameroon forward during the tournament.",
      "And with Amorim desperate to improve on the club's worst-ever Premier League finish last season, the Portuguese would not have wanted to be without that key trio - and maybe event quartet - for these possible matches, including potentially pivotal clashes at Aston Villa and Leeds United and home to Newcastle United and arch-rivals Man City.",
      "Aston Villa vs Man Utd - December 20Man Utd vs Newcastle - December 27Man Utd vs Wolves - December 30Leeds vs Man Utd - January 3Burnley vs Man Utd - January 7Man Utd vs Man City - January 17",
      "The impact for Enzo Maresca appears less severe than for others, with the Blues head coach only likely to have to make do without the services of Senegal striker Nicolas Jackson during AFCON.",
      "And while the 23-year-old's 10 Premier League goals did play a key part in Chelsea securing Champions League football last season, the Blues have since signed Liam Delap, who can replace him in attack during the tournament for these fixtures:",
      "Newcastle vs Chelsea - December 20Chelsea vs Aston Villa - December 27Chelsea vs Bournemouth - December 30Man City vs Chelsea - January 3Fulham vs Chelsea - January 7Chelsea vs Brentford - January 17",
      "New Tottenham manager Thomas Frank will have to make do without both Yves Bissouma and Pape Matar Sarr during Mali's and Senegal's respective AFCON participations.",

      "Arsenal and Newcastle United both appear to have gained an advantage over their other title rivals, with neither team having any players away at AFCON.",
      "The Gunners had been expecting to be without Ghana midfielder Thomas Partey for the tournament, only for the four-time African champions to fail to qualify after finishing bottom of the Group F, missing out for the first time since 2004.",

      "Omar Berrada: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course. We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it?\"",
      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "While United finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea who also beat them in the FA Cup final, the men languished just three places above the Premier League relegation zone and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Nevertheless, Berrada has doubled down on his timetable.",
      "He said: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.",
      "\"Nobody is saying we don't want to win it until then. We're setting ourselves a target with a specific time frame to go and aim for.\"",
      "Berrada also reaffirmed Man Utd's commitment to women's football.",
      "\"We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men's first team but we are committed to making the women's team very successful,\" said Berrada.",
      "\"You've heard [minority owner] Jim [Ratcliffe] say 'if you're wearing the United shirt then you must win'. That's exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and contribute to women's football.\"",
      "Amorim has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford since arriving from Sporting in November.",
      "And Berrada, who joined United after leaving his role as chief football operations officer at City Football Group, believes there are similarities between Amorim and Man City boss Guardiola, who had his own struggles in his first season at the Etihad.",
      "\"Very much so,\" Berrada said when asked if saw similarities between Amorim and Guardiola.",
      "\"It was difficult in Pep's first year.\"",
      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",
      "\"He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.\"",
      "Berrada believes the difficulties Amorim has had to deal with will benefit the head coach and the club next season.",
      "\"It won't be easy,\" he said. \"There'll be some difficult moments ahead.",
      "\"Nothing is going to get solved with one summer window, but we are on the right path.",
      "\"We've put the worst part of this transformation phase behind us and now we're going to start building. I'm very confident we'll get back to the top.\"",
