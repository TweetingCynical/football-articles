      "Napoli are willing to cover all of Kobbie Mainoo's wages in the hope of signing him in the January transfer window. The Italian champions are desperate to lure the Manchester United outcast to Naples as soon as possible.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis has told United he is prepared to honour Mainoo's £35,000-a-week contract. De Laurentiis has spoken to Napoli stars Kevin De Bruyne and Scott McTominay about Mainoo - and the duo have told him the England midfielder would be a great signing for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "Napoli tried to sign Mainoo in the summer, but he decided to remain at United when Ruben Amorim told him he wanted to keep him. But Mainoo has remained on the fringes of Amorim's team and has made just eight appearances in all competitions this season.",
      "It's understood Napoli want to take Mainoo on an initial loan, with a view to making the deal permanent in the summer. Mainoo knows he will have to leave Old Trafford to secure regular starts, if he wants to stand a realistic chance of being included in England's squad for the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Napoli have enjoyed success by signing unwanted United players, with McTominay being named the Serie A Player of the Season in their title-winning campaign. Rasmus Hojlund has also made a strong start since joining on loan in the summer, scoring four goals in seven games so far.",
      "Mainoo fits into the same category as a frustrated player who is seeking regular game time. Coming into this weekend, the 20-year-old United academy graduate had started just one game for United this season, and that came in their disastrous defeat by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "He has been stuck as a substitute in the Premier League, with Amorim picking Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in central midfield. Mainoo's exit was blocked on deadline day, with Amorim explaining in September what he expects from the youngster.",
      "\"I didn't have a conversation with him before the window closed because I didn't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having a conversation with him just to hold on to him,\" he said. \"I did it this week.",
      "\"I believe in him a lot. He is a top player. But some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done [a complete player]. I think he can do so much better. For some guys [talent] is enough, but for him it is not. Maybe it's not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie and that's it.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag was left stunned by his sacking at Manchester United, who'd already agreed terms with Ruben Amorim in secret. United decided to part ways with the Dutchman in the days leading up to his final match, a controversial 2-0 defeat away to West Ham.",
      "Ten Hag, 55, had spent nearly two-and-a-half years in the Old Trafford hot seat, winning a trophy in both of his full seasons. But a lowly eighth-placed finish in the Premier League and poor recruitment ultimately cost the former Ajax boss his job.",
      "Amorim, who was hot property thanks to his success at Sporting Lisbon, was the man chosen to replace him and has now been in charge for just under a year. As we approach the anniversary of his official appointment, the story of how he agreed to become United's manager has surfaced - and it's brutal for Ten Hag.",
      "In the summer of 2024, Old Trafford chiefs privately spoke to different coaches about replacing him. After holding talks with Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi, United's new-look hierarchy - headed up by Sir Jim Ratcliffe - opted to keep Ten Hag, triggering a one-year extension in his contract as a show of commitment.",
      "But a poor start to his third season at the helm prompted Ratcliffe and Co to rethink. After going back to the drawing board, Amorim emerged as their top target and a meeting in Spain was set.",
      "The Athletic report that by October 25, 2024, the Portuguese had agreed personal terms and said 'yes' in calls with Red Devils CEO Omar Berrada and soon-to-be director of football Jason Wilcox. That was all while United's players, Ten Hag and staff were travelling to London preparing to face West Ham.",
      "Ten Hag's side were fresh off a 1-1 draw with Fenerbahce in Turkey, having beaten Brentford 2-1 at home the weekend prior. But United's bigwigs had already made their minds up.",
      "Will Ruben Amorim have a more successful reign than Erik ten Hag? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "So when the Red Devils conceded a late penalty at the London Stadium, the axe was being sharped. On the Monday, October 28, Ten Hag was summoned to Carrington and informed of his sacking by Berrarda.",
      "His reaction was one of shock. Ten Hag believed that he'd be given more time under the club's new leadership after proving that he could deliver silverware.",
      "After deciding to wait until the beginning of the 2025-26 season to return to management, Ten Hag was appointed by Bayer Leverkusen, replacing the highly successful Xabi Alonso. His reign lasted just three games.",

Moments earlier, Nicola Savona appeared to deflect a dangerous cross and keep the ball in play, yet the assistant referee, positioned on the opposite side of the pitch, signalled for a corner.",

      "Manchester United's winning streak was halted by Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. After a challenging year at the helm of the Red Devils, Ruben Amorim's squad entered the match on the back of three consecutive Premier League wins.",
      "The Portuguese mastermind's side took the lead through Casemiro and held the advantage going into half time. However, Sean Dyche's team flipped the script as Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona found the net within the first five minutes of the second half.",
      "The Reds were teetering on the edge of defeat until Amad Diallo stepped up to score a breathtaking equaliser with just nine minutes remaining, securing a 2-2 draw for the Reds. Here's how the United players fared at the City Ground...",
      "Despite pulling off several key saves, he couldn't prevent Forest's two goals, especially the second one. Rating: 6/10.",
      "Most of Forest's attacking play avoided Yoro, which could be seen as a testament to the Frenchman's defensive skills. Rating: 7/10.",
      "He made an excellent recovery to deny Nicolo Savona in the first half, but should have done better with Forest's second goal. Rating: 6/10.",
      "If he continues this form, he'll surely earn a recall to the England squad. It was unfortunate he was part of a defence which conceded twice. Rating: 6/10.",
      "He had a couple of cracking chances when he darted in from the right wing. Despite failing to win the header against Gibbs-White, he netted a stunning equaliser to make it 2-2. Rating: 7/10.",
      "The Brazilian ace got United off to a dream start with a superb header. He seemed to flag as the match progressed, but managed to clock up his first full 90 minutes in the Premier League this season. Rating: 6/10.",
      "The Portuguese maestro was somewhat quiet in the first half until he whipped in a gorgeous cross for Casemiro's goal. He rattled the woodwork in the second half, but Casemiro couldn't pounce on the rebound. Rating: 6/10.",
      "Dalot always raises eyebrows when deployed on the left flank and he was caught out at various points during the game. Amorim expected more from him, but he failed to deliver. Rating: 3/10.",

      "A quickfire double at the start of the second half saw Nottingham Forest come close to stunning Manchester United at the City Ground, only for Amad to volley home a stunning equaliser. United could have gone second in the Premier League with a win, but the point will still be a welcome sight for Ruben Amorim after his team trailed going into the final 10 minutes.",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona netted within the space of three minutes to turn the game on its head after Casemiro had given United a half-time lead. However, Amad lashed the ball beyond Matz Sels from the edge of the box and the goal was allowed to stand after a VAR check.",
      "Casemiro had earlier been given the freedom of the City Ground to send a free header into the bottom corner from a Bruno Fernandes set piece. However, the start of the second half provided a reminder that things aren't quite as desperate as they seem for Forest or as positive as they once seemed for their opponents.",
      "Bruno Fernandes fired against the foot of the post as United looked to bring themselves level, but Forest kept creating themselves. Igor Jesus was inches away from making it 3-1 with 25 minutes remaining and that might have been too much for the visitors to come back from.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team went into the game chasing a fourth straight victory and started on the front foot. Benjamin Sesko has yet to hit top gear following his summer move but got an early sight of goal - with his effort deflected off-target - and showed some decent hold-up play in the early knockings.",
      "Forest began to grow into the game, with Callum Hudson-Odoi offering a threat from out on the left and Elliot Anderson battling hard in the middle. They also squandered a promising opening when Nicolo Savona broke free down the right but got his final ball wrong, while United themselves continued to impress in flashes and Amad's deflected effort forced Matz Sels into a sharp stop.",
      "After snatching a lead and going in ahead at the break, United, might have expected their struggling opponents to crumble. The opposite was true, though, with Forest showing the kind of fight they will need to survive.",
      "Last weekend, Forest conceded against Bournemouth from a corner they don't believe should have been given. History repeated itself this week, though things weren't quite as cut and dried.",
      "There was no doubt that a Bournemouth boot touched the ball last before Marcus Tavernier's Olimpico last time out. Here, the question concerned whether Savona was able to keep the ball from going behind, and plenty of outside observers agreed with Savona that play should have continued.",
      "One thing that is for sure is that Forest should have got closer to Casemiro from the corner, just as they should have kept out Tavernier's effort at the Vitality Stadium. Set piece frailty is hardly the earmark of a Sean Dyche side, and he'll have reason to be annoyed.",
      "Amad is unlikely to score many better goals than the one on Saturday. The Ivorian's connection was as sweet as they come, with Sels powerless as the ball nestled in the back of his net.",
      "Forest's complaint will be about what came before.. The ball appeared to strike Patrick Dorgu on the arm as it spun up a few seconds before Amad struck, but neither the on-field referee nor the video assistant felt it was anough to disallow the goal.",
      "That's two United goals which brought Forest complaints and they'll have to show spirit to put it all behind them. Amad won't mind, though, and it could be a vital moment for the Ivorian and his team.",
      "If Savona was allowing himself to stew on that corner drama in the first half, he was soon over it. The Italian isn't known for his goals - he had just two in Serie A for Juventus last term - but sometimes quick reactions are all you need.",
      "During Ange Postecoglou's brief tenure, Forest's players often looked lost and unable to form a united front. The period featured players looking unsure of their exact role, and the Italian was one of them.",
      "New boss Dyche has long been a man who builds from the back, whether that's in the middle or in the full-back positions. Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic might look like the most obvious beneficiaries, but they're not the only ones.",
      "It has taken a year, but Ruben Amorim at last named an unchanged Manchester United XI in the Premier League. He might feel he doesn't quite have the squad he needs to put his system into effect, but he at least has 11 players he is willing to trust to do it in back-to-back games..",
      "That meant another start for Casemiro and a goal for the Brazilian. He might not be at his Real Madrid levels, or even the level he was in his first United season, but Amorim has found a way to use him.",
      "“I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone,\" Amorim recently said of Casemiro. “In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.”",
      "There was a moment in the first half when Senne Lammens was given the closest thing a goalkeeper can get to a hospital pass. The ball was pinged in his direction at pace by a United defender, but he calmly controlled the ball and continued as if it was no big deal.",
      "He remained a composed figure for the remainder of the first half, and didn't give the impression he could have done much with Forest's goals. One thing's for certain, though, and that's that he appeared unruffled throughout.",
      "United were reluctant to throw the Belgian in from the start after his arrival from Royal Antwerp, with suggestions they were worried about over-exposing him to the pressure of the role. On current evidence, though, he's exactly the right fit.",
      "It feels like every week or two we're handed a definitive assessment of where Manchester United sit on the 'it's so over' to 'we're so back' scale. Sometimes we even get variations within the space of a single game, and it felt like today was one of those days.",
      "As always, it can help to develop some perspective. The season doesn't end in November, and there's a long way to go from here for both United and Forest.",
      "The challenge for managers is to block out the noise and get the message across to their players that things don't move as dramatically from one week to the next as some might have you believe. That is easier said than done, but any boss able to do just that is on to a winner.",

      "“I know [the fans might care] but it’s not my way of seeing things, I just want to win every game and to finish top of the league. I want to be in the position to be champions of the Premier League, so I don’t care about the moment in the table.",
      "“I remember people said I was naive to talk about winning the Premier League. The goal of this board, of the owners, the staff, is winning the Premier League, that doesn’t change. I don’t know how long it’s going to take.",
      "“So we never change our narrative. We never change because we are winning now, we are going to change what we want to do. And when we were losing we said all of the same things. We want to win the Premier League, that is our goal. Let’s see how long it is going to take.”",
      "Asked to reflect on a year in charge in his pre-match press conference, Amorim said: “It was a journey. A big journey. It was tough. It was really tough, good moments, bad moments. I learned a lot, that is really important.",
      "“I found out that even in my lower moments, I can stick with the things I believe and that is a good thing for anyone, to understand that. Today, the answer is different from three weeks ago. So, it’s important to understand that. It’s one of the biggest honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years.”",

      "Ex-Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen has lauded the impact of £62.5m summer signing Matheus Cunha, but also challenged him to maintain his form. Cunha, who was signed from Wolves during the summer transfer window, has been a key addition to Ruben Amorim's squad, scoring once since his move and becoming a regular starter under Amorim.",
      "The Brazilian netted his first goal for United during their 4-2 victory over Brighton last weekend. Despite not yet registering an assist, he has received high praise for his start at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen, who served as Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant manager during several Premier League title-winning campaigns, has been impressed with Cunha - but believes the next challenge for the player is to reach the same levels as those big names who shone under Ferguson.",
      "\"I was very positive about United signing Matheus Cunha. He's a great player,\" Meulensteen said in an interview with Compare.bet.",
      "\"I think he also has all the mental attributes to play for a club like Manchester United. He's got that aura.",
      "\"He wants the ball. You can give him the ball and it's hard to get it off him.",
      "\"He has raised the ceiling of this United squad and that will rub off on other players because when they see that Cunha, he's a player, and [Bryan] Mbeumo is a player, too, it lifts everyone to push their own games.",
      "\"I still find it a shame seeing Cunha and Mbeumo together, with Bruno Fernandes having to play that deeper role, because if you could have Bruno in a more advanced position where he can really roam around as we are used to, there are even more goals there playing with Cunha, Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko - without a shadow of doubt.",
      "\"The challenge now for Cunha is making sure that he shows that consistency that Manchester United need now, week-in and week-out.",
      "\"That's what made United great under Sir Alex Ferguson. We had a good squad, we had good players, we had balance in the squad, it was the performance.",
      "\"They were so consistent, no matter who we played in the Premier League, in the FA Cup or any other cups or Champions League, the players performed. That is what United need to get back to - starting with Nottingham Forest and Spurs.\"",
      "Cunha's next chance to impress for United will be during their Premier League clash against Nottingham Forest on Saturday afternoon. United go into the game against Forest on the back of three consecutive wins in the top flight which has seen them climb up to sixth place in the overall standings.",

      "Manchester United legend Nani has revealed his delight at watching Marcus Rashford flourish - even though it's happening away from Old Trafford at Barcelona.",
      "After a troubled period under Ruben Amorim before departing the Red Devils, Rashford has been brilliant on loan at the Catalan giants - enjoying a complete change of scenery. The 28-year-old has netted five goals and provided seven assists across 13 outings in all competitions so far.",
      "While making an instant impact, Rashford has, previously, suffered poor patches of form and became embroiled in disciplinary woes at United even before Amorim's arrival at the club. The manager ultimately decided he needed to move him on this summer.",
      "Meanwhile, the Red Devils have endured another testing start to this season, despite their recent upturn in form. Nani's joy at witnessing Rashford's revival since departing United might well surprise some, though.",
      "Obviously, United would have much rather witnessed him recapture his finest form at M16 instead of excelling at a European competitor. Nevertheless, Nani confessed he's happy to witness the England player returning to his peak.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford entertained Man Utd fans for many years and he's a great player - scoring beautiful goals at Old Trafford,\" he told Covers.com. \"I don't know what happened with him at the club and, unfortunately, he's no longer part of the team.",
      "\"However, we're always happy for those who start at our club, to see them shining all over the world, especially if he's playing for Barcelona. It's a big club with a lot of talent and, if he stands up there, shows his quality and scores goals, we'll always be happy.\"",
      "However, Amorim will also be aware that it's in United's best interests for Rashford to maintain his best form and deliver top-notch performances in La Liga. Barcelona are tipped to make his move permanent - if he maintains his impressive form this season.",
      "Rashford has a £30m buy option in his contract. Barcelona, though, might aim to negotiate a slightly lower price.",

      "The pressure was on Amorim ahead of a home meeting with Sunderland in October. They won that game, and followed it up with victories over Liverpool and Brighton as the new-look front three of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko started to click.",
      "Next up for United is a trip to the City Ground and now it's his opposite number Sean Dyche who is up against it. \"It was a poor result for Sean Dyche against Bournemouth, especially after doing so well in Europe. It will be a rocking atmosphere at Forest, as always when Man United come to town,\" Shearer told Betfair.",
      "\"United are looking for results to keep the good run going and they’ve had a week off due to being knocked out of the Carabao Cup. I think Forest will get something out of the game, but I'm not sure they'll win, so I'm going to say a draw.",
      "\"I think it’s too early to say they’re the real deal and that United can finish in the top four or five. If they can continue this in a month's time, I might change my mind, but let’s see what the next couple of weeks bring, and then we can judge whether they’re certainly improving.\"",
      "Shearer's comments come as Forest star Morgan Gibbs-White made the unusual move of publicly showing his delight in United's persistence and turnaround. \"It’s been incredible to see, obviously they’ve been going through a tough time in the past couple of years,\" the England international told Stan Sport (via Goal).",
      "\"But they’ve stuck with the gaffer [Amorim] and the past four or five games, you’re really starting to see how Man United should be playing, that grit and that determination to want to play for the badge. I feel like it’s been incredible to see, it’s something I feel like the league has missed.\"",
      "“They are beginning to turn things around, it seems, but we have to safeguard against that,\" Dyche said of United. \"There are subtle changes in the way they’re playing, and they have delivered performances that can win. We’ve got to be aware of that, but equally – if you look at our performance against Porto – that was a performance that we think would win against a lot of teams.",
      "“We need to find our own freedom to it, especially here at the City Ground, where they’re always in good voice, but against the bigger names, on paper. We think we can get that energy between us and that front-foot thinking from the stands, which the players will buzz off.”",

Discussing Aiden's routine, he added: \"I pick him up every Tuesday from his daycare and we go swimming. Loves swimming then we get his pizza on the way home. Thursday pick him up, go for something to eat, go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house and we go to Tesco where he buys a trolley full of chocolate.",

      "\"My whole life your priority has always been being my dad, and growing up and realising how hard you had to work everyday alongside that is something I can’t even comprehend.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim wasn't the only contender to replace Erik ten Hag in 2024. United also explored moves for Thomas Tuchel and Roberto De Zerbi several months before landing the Portuguese, it has been claimed.",
      "Ten Hag's position was under threat towards the end of the 2023/24 season, with the Premier League side considering their options after some concerning results and performances. After winning the FA Cup final, though, the Dutchman was given a stay of execution.",
      "By the time Ten Hag eventually lost his job in October last year, De Zerbi and Tuchel had already found employment elsewhere. Former Brighton boss De Zerbi took over at Marseille shortly after leaving the Amex Stadium while Tuchel agreed terms with England in the autumn and ultimately took charge in January 2025.",
      "According to The Athletic, United were still considering Tuchel a fortnight after their cup final win. The German met with United chiefs in Monaco but didn't reach an agreement and indeed is said to have not been prepared to return to football so soon after leaving Bayern Munich.",
      "De Zerbi's talks, meanwhile, were reportedly halted after the Italian rejected an initial offer from United. An improved offer didn't arrive, and the 46-year-old is now in charge at Marseille.",
      "Ultimately, Ten Hag was backed in the transfer market to the tune of around £200million as United looked to turn things around under the ex-Ajax boss. He only lasted a few months, picking up 11 points from nine league games to leave United 14th in the table.",
      "Results picked up under caretaker boss Ruud van Nistelrooy but Amorim was unable to inspire a full recovery in the league. He led the team to a Europa League final - and within 90 minutes of a trophy and a Champions League spot - but an eight-game winless run in April and May brought a 15th-place finish.",
      "United made a slow start in Amorim's first full season but things have gradually picked up. Three wins on the spin have seen the Red Devils climb a congested table to sit in sixth place ahead of Saturday's meeting with Nottingham Forest.",
      "“During my career as a manager, most of the time I was winning,” Amorim told MUTV as he brought up a year in charge. “When you are winning, you can say that you have convictions and you are loyal to your ideas, but you learn when you lose, when you are under pressure and I learned that when I’m under pressure, I’m stronger on my ideas and I keep with my ideas.",
      "“Of course, it’s really important to feel the support of everyone in the club, especially the fans that help you, to give you that confidence to continue on your path, but that was the biggest learning point: when I’m under pressure, I can stick with my plan.”",

      "Harry Maguire was the only notable absentee - aside from long-term injury victim Lisandro Martinez - for last weekend's win over Brighton. The England international could return to the squad against Forest, though United are unlikely to risk rushing him back.",
      "After picking up a knock last week, Mason Mount was left on the bench against Brighton. He is, however, expected to be fully fit for the Forest game. Luke Shaw was also a doubt heading into the clash against the Seagulls after coming down ill, yet managed to play through it.",
      "Amorim did, however, admit the defender was \"suffering\" during the game. These concerns aside, the United boss is likely to have close to a full-strength squad at his disposal.",
      "Chris Wood is yet to feature under Dyche after sustaining an injury last month, though the New Zealand striker could return to contention this weekend. However, Forest may opt against rushing him back into action.",
      "Elsewhere, Dyche will be without Ola Aina, who remains sidelined with a thigh problem, while Dilane Bakwa is also unavailable. Oleksandr Zinchenko faces a late fitness test, with his involvement still in doubt.",

      "United's last Premier League triumph over Forest came back in August 2023. Before that, the Red Devils had enjoyed a dominant run of 10 consecutive victories over the East Midlands outfit, a streak that stretched all the way back to 1996.",

      "Semenyo stepped up for Bournemouth last term after Dominic Solanke was sold to Tottenham Hotspur. His performances prompted interest from other Premier League clubs during the summer transfer window, with Semenyo reportedly meeting up with United boss Ruben Amorim at the end of last season.",
      "The Bournemouth forward has also been touted as a future replacement for Mohamed Salah at Liverpool. However, despite seeing several of his Bournemouth team-mates move on, Semenyo chose to extend his contract until 2030.",
      "His new deal is claimed to include a release clause and although the figure is unknown, it is said that the Cherries value Semenyo at £75million. While many players might choose not to discuss their future, Semenyo has admitted he is aware of the transfer speculation surrounding him, but is happy with his decision to stay with Bournemouth in the summer.",

      "\"When they (his former team-mates) all left [in the summer], there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club. But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year. How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well.",

      "Their previous sit-down, three years ago, led to Manchester United and the player mutually agreeing to end his contract during the mid-season World Cup in Qatar. That exit allowed Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr to sign Ronaldo, where he continues playing out his career to this day.",
      "Morgan has described their most recent exchange as \"amazingly heartfelt, honest, warm and often hilarious\". Morgan has teased the interview on his Instagram account.",
      "\"So many people asking me about my new interview with Cristiano Ronaldo,\" the caption of his post reads. \"What does he say? How personal does he get? Is it very revealing? Was anything off limits? To which the answers are: a) A lot, b) VERY, c) Yes, and d) No.\"",
      "\"I spent 80 minutes chatting to the (goat emoji) of football at his home in Saudi Arabia, and it was an amazingly heartfelt, honest, warm and often hilarious conversation. It airs next week on Piers Morgan Uncensored. You won't want to miss this!\"",
      "Morgan also shared on X: \"UPDATE: The announcement of my new Ronaldo interview has now been viewed 51 million times on our combined X and Insta accounts. In just 24 hours...! This is why he's the (goat emoji).\" Morgan's announcement post has just over 344,000 views at the time of writing.",

      "The Manchester United squad answering Bruno Fernandes' demand for a tactical change has proved crucial in sparking their current winning streak. Ruben Amorim's team have won their previous three league games, with United hoping to make it four victories on the bounce in their visit to Nottingham Forest on Saturday.",
      "While Amorim recently orchestrated a stunning 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield, the Red Devils' subsequent 4-2 home triumph against Brighton last weekend was perhaps even more important. Goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and a Bryan Mbeumo double helped create the belief that United's promising form might be more than a brief hot streak.",
      "United boss Amorim has faced fierce criticism during his reign for his unwavering commitment to his 3-4-3 system. Many pundits and United supporters previously argued that the team were poorly suited to the formation.",
      "However, Fernandes predicted how United could transform their fortunes following the club's 3-0 derby defeat to Manchester City in September. The United captain emphasised that for the side to flourish, more players needed to drop into midfield.",
      "The midfield partnership of Fernandes and Casemiro was frequently overwhelmed during the opening weeks of the campaign before United started to follow their skipper's advice. Fernandes highlighted the issue when comparing United's shortcomings to City's flurry of midfielders.",
      "\"If you look at City, they had Rodri, Tiji [Reijnders], Bernardo [Silva] coming in, [Phil] Foden. They make basically a midfield four against a two.",
      "\"So you need the ones in behind you to jump, like Luke [Shaw] was doing very well on Tiji. We did it in the first game against Arsenal, that's why they didn't play. They couldn't find the spaces to play.",
      "\"That's what makes the spaces very narrow to play against a team that is very aggressive to play on the front foot. If you're not brave enough to do that, they will find the spaces to play because we're playing against a top opponent.\"",
      "It appears the United squad have taken Fernandes' request on board. Luke Shaw, in particular, received praise for his recent display against Brighton, at times advancing from his role in the back three into the midfield.",
      "The extra backing for Fernandes and Casemiro gave United greater stability, enabling the team to thrive. Meanwhile, Shaw claimed an assist for Casemiro's deflected strike against Brighton after challenging for possession in midfield.",
      "\"What Man United have been crying out for is if you're going to play that system, be brave,\" former City defender Micah Richards said on The Rest Is Football podcast. Luke Shaw was very brave the way he stepped in, and then they go and get the goal.",
      "\"If you look at the positioning yesterday of Cunha, Cunha was filling in in that midfield role.\" He continued: \"That's the first time I've been convinced that [United] know exactly what their roles are. Now the challenge is consistency.\"",
      "The tactical flexibility shown by both Shaw and Cunha gave United the numerical advantage that Fernandes believed was lacking in the match against City. A few weeks later, United's response to their captain's plea for more support has been key to their winning streak.",

      "The former Manchester United midfielder departed Juventus in mid-November after mutually agreeing to terminate his contract in Turin. That move came six weeks before Pogba could return to training following his doping suspension, which Pogba claims was because of a prescribed nutritional supplement.",
      "His four-year ban began in September 2023, but after an appeal, Pogba had it halved to 18 months. He has been cleared to play since March.",

      "\"Paul still has a training session on Thursday, and if he is feeling good, we could see him again. And he would be within the process that we fixed.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the midfielder is not in good shape after that session, having sustained an ankle injury. \"We are awaiting confirmation of the severity of the injury,\" Pocognoli said.",

      "Amad's stunning volley from the edge of the box will be prominent in this season's highlights reel. The 23-year-old looked disappointed when the full-time whistle went, despite scoring a stunner. The away end chanted \"we love United, we do\" after a spirited fight to avoid defeat.",
      "Amorim named an unchanged team for the first time in the Premier League. Amorim has previously chopped and changed, but rewarded the players who delivered against Brighton.",
      "United had lost their last two away league games against Nottingham Forest. Anthony Elanga scored in a 1-0 Forest win in April when Amorim desperately resorted to throwing Harry Maguire up front.",
      "United have been the leading goalscorers in the Premier League since the victory against Burnley at the end of September so Maguire was not required as an auxiliary forward again.",
      "Forest sacked Nuno Espirito Santo just three games into the campaign. Ange Postecoglou was appointed as his successor and lasted just 39 days in charge after failing to win any of his eight games.",
      "Sean Dyche has a reputation for rescuing sinking ships. Dyche appears to be a sensible appointment and he urged their fans to create an intimidating atmosphere against United in his programme notes.",

      "Anderson has been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but he is exactly what his shirt number suggests: a No.8. United do not need a player of that profile and should focus on other targets next summer.",
      "United created chances in the first half and Benjamin Sesko looked lively, although he scuffed a shot in the box and dragged an effort wide of the post after skilfully fashioning a yard of space for himself.",
      "Amad should have done better when he guided a shot at Matz Sels. Amorim couldn't stand still on the touchline, clearly wanting more cutting edge from his players after a mixed start.",
      "United were ahead shortly after following a stroke of good fortune, scoring from a corner when the ball didn't look to have gone out of play for the set piece to be awarded.",
      "Fernandes was responsible for the delivery and briefly congratulated Casemiro before being summoned to the touchline to receive tactical instructions from Amorim.",
      "There were loud boos for referee Darren England when he returned to the dressing room for the interval, the Forest fans feeling aggrieved about the decision to award a corner.",
      "The chatter among the home supporters on the concourse on the way to the press room was about the dubious decision. The chatter in the away section was probably about how important Casemiro is again.",
      "The 33-year-old has enjoyed an unlikely resurgence this year and he was serenaded after opening the scoring. \"Du, du, du, du, Casemiro,\" sang the 3,000 Mancunians housed in the Bridgford Stand.",
      "The Forest fans who were complaining were on their feet twice just six minutes into the second half. The disadvantages of playing Amad at right wing-back were highlighted when Morgan Gibbs-White won their aerial mismatch to score a header. Then Forest scored again through Nicola Savona.",
      "United were punished by another ball into the box. Dyche was beaming from the dug-out. He enjoyed success at Burnley and Everton by setting up his teams to score similar aerial goals.",
      "\"Lino, what's the score?,\" chirped the Brian Clough Stand. Forest had last clinched a league win against Brentford in August and their fans sensed the first big result of Dyche's tenure.",
      "The draw is a reminder that there is more work for Amorim to do. The 40-year-old enjoyed an October to remember, but he must secure successive wins again during the winter.",
      "Amorim will be pleased with the spirit shown after falling behind, particularly from Amad after losing the battle with Gibbs-White for his goal. Amad is the kind of character that Amorim wants in the dressing room.",
      "And it helps that he's also a very good footballer.",

      "\"We talk more about this, that football is like this, and we proved it this year. We can have bad moments, but suddenly we have three good games. So football is like that. And the game is like that also.",
      "\"We had good moments, we score, you can sense we are in control of the game when the first half finished. We started the second half, we suffer, disconnect for five minutes and that's enough in the Premier League, but we managed to recover from that, which is a good feeling.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the game in further detail, Amorim said: \"We lost control of the game for five minutes and paid the price. We did some things well. Our level of energy dropped a little bit.",
      "\"And when our energy drops a little bit, you can feel it. We can play well, but it's not full power. But my feeling is that the players tried, really tried. They tried during the week and tried again today.",
      "\"In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and we suffer two goals, we didn't recover. Today is a different feeling and you can sense we could win this game, but we weren't going to lose, and that's sometimes the feeling a big team sometimes has.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to win in the end, but we drew. We dropped two points. I think last year we suffered a lot. We want to win games and overcome these moments, but now they know how to do it.",
      "\"We just need to be inside of the game until the final 10 minutes of the game. That is part of football. In the past, we could have lost everything in the positions and the way we play the game.",
      "\"I think we are improving in that aspect. Again, we did some things right, but we also have potential to play so much better, which is the goal.\"",

      "United opened the scoring in a tight first half when Bruno Fernandes' corner was headed in by Casemiro. However, Dyche and the Forest fans were left angry that the corner was given in the first place.",
      "\"They give corners that aren't corners. They gave one last week and one this week. It's a really poor decision.",
      "\"That decides a lot. We are fighting for our lives to get up the table.\"",
      "For a time it seemed that the goal would be a non-factor in the game. Immediately after half-time, Morgan Gibbs-White equalised with a good header and the roof lifted off the City Ground moments later as Savona prodded Forest ahead.",
      "However, the game was rescued in the 81st minute after a scramble in the Forest penalty area saw the ball fly out to Amad who volleyed superbly to level proceedings.",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur before the final international break of 2025.",

      "Harry Maguire has come back into the squad having missed last weekend's win over Brighton through injury. The England international has been named on the bench with Leny Yoro keeping his place alongside Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw.",

We need everybody, we all want to win the game, and when we win the game it's not just the starting XI. If we remember, some of the games they are the ones (the substitutes) who win the game.",

    "body": [
      "Ruben Amorim warned that the storm was coming after his Manchester United appointment, but the dark clouds have lifted above Old Trafford and brighter days seem to be ahead.",
      "United have won three Premier League games on the bounce and Amorim has been nominated for October's manager of the month award. The victory against Liverpool at Anfield felt like it could be a tenure-defining result, and United built on that performance by securing three points against Brighton last weekend.",
      "It's the one-year anniversary of Amorim's appointment from Sporting Lisbon today, and the 40-year-old will try to mark the occasion by winning away against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Amorim spoke to reporters at Carrington on Thursday and discussed his first 12 months in Manchester. \"We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is like this,\" he said when asked whether the storm he predicted would come had passed.",
      "\"And we are not that team that I can say to you, now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust my players more, I think they trust me more. That will come with wins.",
      "\"You can sense that, because everyone now is saying that, 'Oh, connected they are, and they believe in the manager'. It's about winning games, it didn't change a lot, because against Arsenal I saw the same thing.",
      "\"So I don't know. I think that we are in a better place, but it's also really good to be always without feeling and prepared that something can change. If we have that feeling, we will be more... We will pay attention to the details, we will maintain that course of our path. I can say that we are a better team in this moment.\"",
      "When asked whether there had been any moments when he doubted he would last a year in the job, Amorim said: \"It's hard to say that. Sometimes in some moments... I know that you are going to write [laughs]... But there were some moments that were tough to deal with, to lose so many games, that was so hard for me, because this is Manchester United.",
      "\"The position that we had in the last year, putting all the attention on Europa League and not winning, that was massive. So I had some moments that I struggled a lot.",
      "\"And I was thinking that maybe it's not meant to be. Today is the opposite. So you can write this one. Today I feel that, and I know that, that was the best decision in my life, and I want to be here.\"",
      "Amorim has remained upbeat even during the tough moments. \"It's also my character, and then sometimes it's also... I know that a lot of people want to see me arriving here with that face that I'm suffering, and I like to do the opposite, sometimes I think about that,\" he said.",
      "\"But it's the way of seeing things. So I said, since the first moment, this will not change who I am, and I'm like that, and I live my life like this, and I know that football will change in some moment, and now we are in a good moment, but I'm always with that feeling here that something can change.",
      "\"So I try to balance my life, but you can say that I laugh a lot, but you also can say that I'm always like [lowers his head] this on the bench, and like this [pretends to be exasperated], so I just live with emotions, and I follow my team. If my team is playing well and running a lot, I will be a happy man.\"",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has refused to tweak his system, despite intense scrutiny. Is he tempted to turn around and say 'I told you so' after an excellent October?",
      "\"No, because I know that in two weeks this could change again,\" he said. \"And you will say, 'No, no, we were right,' so it's like a crazy conversation. I just have a clear idea how I want to do things, I'm always saying the same thing.",
      "\"For me, it's a 3-4-3 that we are going to change against different opponents, so I just need time, like every manager. Maybe my way of doing things is going to take more time, for people to start seeing things.",
      "\"And that manager that arrives in one club, in the next four games they can win three and lose one, but then there's also luck in the games, again, we had some luck against Liverpool, and all the narrative changed because of that, so I understand football, I just do what I feel is the best thing for the team and for the club.\"",
      "Amorim added on his formation: \"I think the rotation of the team is easier for me, because I spend so much time thinking about that. I don't see it as a 3-4-3, I see it at the beginning, at the base of the idea of 3-4-3.",
      "\"Because I spend a lot of time playing like that, because when I start thinking about the system, nobody was playing 3-4-3, so I can understand how to rotate players, even in the way we buy players.",
      "\"If you have a clear idea how to play, it's easy for you to point, this is the guy that I want. And that can help you. When you have today is 4-3-3, and then tomorrow is 4-4-2, it's harder to make the characteristics right for the players, so I try to use all this knowledge to search for the right players.\"",
      "Although Amorim discussed bringing in players for his system, he played down plans for the January transfer window. \"I don't know what is going to happen,\" he said.",
      "\"A lot of things can happen. Even in our club, and you know that we have the World Cup, some players are not playing, they will ask to leave, so I have to manage everything.",
      "\"And then we want to bring players, everyone here, we want to bring players that we can see a big future in Manchester United. We are not just buying one guy, because now we feel in December that we need this kind of player for now. No, it's going to be... We want to buy players that we know we are not going to change a lot of times. So that is our idea.",
      "\"So I don't know what is going to happen, but of course, we think about how we can improve the team, and January, the window is open, we can do something.\"",
      "United's direct approach was effective against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, and Amorim was asked whether that was an example of his tactics evolving. \"I also don't believe that we have a style that we have to build up always from the back,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"We want to build up to push the opponents to have space to score goals. If the space is there, if the numbers are there, if there is three against three in front, and I have Ben [Sesko], [Matheus] Cunha, for example, and Bryan [Mbeumo] I will put the ball in two passes, I want to score goals in two passes.",
      "\"But sometimes you have to build up. What I try to teach my players is which kind of game I need to play in this situation. That is my job, I don't want to teach my players to build up with a lot of touches and then bring it.",
      "\"If you need a lot of touches, you will understand that you need a lot of touches. If you need one, put the ball, because the fans want to see a different game. We are in England, I try to show you a little bit of English football in the past.",
      "\"It's [not] that I don't have a clear way of building up, I just look at the space, the number of players, the characteristics of my players and try to use that to win games.\"",
      "Amorim urged his players to reproduce their Old Trafford performances when playing away this season. \"When we play at home we are more intense, we are more focused, our fans help us a lot, when we have an opportunity you can feel the stadium helping us to control the game,\" he said.",
      "\"But when we play away, it's different. The fans are not there for us, against Brentford we were not so intense, our recovery was not so good, against Fulham we lost control of the game when we were winning, and we show a different team, that we are a different team playing in our home.",
      "\"So it's not a technical thing, it's not a tactical thing, we need to play a different style, we just need to be the same team, to believe in the same way that we do at home. We need to show that away.\"",

      "Here's how our United writers think United should line up against Forest:",
      "Steven Railston",
      "There is no need to change the starting line-up after last weekend's win against Brighton. Amorim should make no changes and continue with the players who were responsible for that 4-2 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Casemiro has become an important player again and should start alongside Bruno Fernandes in the centre of midfield. Amad is developing an excellent understanding with Bryan Mbeumo down the right.",
      "Benjamin Sesko came close to scoring against Brighton and should have chances to find the net against a struggling Forest side.",
      "Jack Flintham",
      "Amorim said before the Liverpool game that he did not pick Sesko as Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate enjoy the aerial battle. Forest's centre-back pairing of Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will be very similar so there's no harm in adopting the striker-less tactic again.",
      "Mount is fit again and while Sesko did well at home to Brighton, he is the obvious player to drop out.",
      "Doubts surrounding Maguire's fitness mean Leny Yoro should be guaranteed a start again this weekend. A nervy moment up against Yankuba Minteh aside, he had a good game against Brighton so deserves to keep his place.",

The process to appoint a new permanent manager is underway and the club will update supporters further on this as soon as possible.\"",
      "In the interim, Martin O'Neill and Shaun Maloney have agreed to oversee Celtic's operations while the search for a new permanent first-team manager continues. Several names, including Damien Duff, Steven Gerrard and Ange Postecoglou, have been suggested as potential successors at Celtic Park following Rodgers' exit, but Nani has also suggested that Keane should step up.",
      "In an interview with Covers, the 38-year-old, who represented the Reds between 2007 and 2015, said: \"It would be great to see Roy Keane back in management, everyone loves to see personalities like that in the game.",
      "\"He's a strong personality, confident in what he's doing and saying.",

      "Following a distinguished playing career for Cobh Rangers, United, Nottingham Forest and Celtic, Keane stepped into management with Sunderland AFC in 2006. He guided the Black Cats to Premier League promotion in his first campaign before stepping down in 2008.",

      "Casemiro's opening goal for Manchester United in their Premier League match with Nottingham Forest perhaps shouldn't have counted. Ruben Amorim's side dominated the opening 30 minutes and got their reward when the Brazil international headed home a Bruno Fernandes corner.",
      "However, that set-piece was a contentious issue. Nicola Savona headed away a dangerous cross as he looked to keep the ball in, though the assistant referee - who was on the other side of the pitch - put his flag up for a corner that Casemiro subsequently scored from.",
      "Ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean has since made his thoughts on the incident perfectly clear.",
      "The half-time whistle at the City Ground just 10 minutes later was met by boos from the home supporters with Elliot Anderson among the players that complained to officials. United will not care very much, however, as they search a fourth consecutive victory in the Premier League.",
      "Wins over Brighton, Liverpool and Sunderland came before the trip to Nottingham with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Casemiro proving clinical in front of goal.",
      "Only playing once every seven days has, seemingly, helped United and Amorim with another three points this afternoon likely to take them into the top-four, if only for a few hours.",
      "Speaking on Forest, he said at a press conference: \"More or less, I watched the last game, it was one of the first ones here that we won, we were so lucky in that game. I watched against Porto, I watched against Bournemouth, the style of play is similar, with different characteristics.",
      "\"I watched one game that we didn't pre-season with Sporting CP, so to try to understand how he played in that game. It's similar, he can change some characteristics of the players with the talent that they have, especially with Gibbs-White, Anderson, Hudson-Odoi, very good players.",
      "\"So we need to be prepared for a different game against Brighton. We had space to play. We are not going to have that space.",
      "\"You need to understand that we are not being the same team away and at home, so we need to improve the way we control the environment. Every tackle is a big moment for the opponent's fans, so we need to play better away.",
      "\"We are prepared for a very tough match.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim wants Luke Shaw to play himself back into the England squad, but he would not mind if the defender was overlooked if it means he stays fully fit for Manchester United.",
      "Shaw has started every Premier League game this season and has remained injury-free.",
      "The 30-year-old seemed to pick up a knock against Brighton, but Amorim later confirmed he was substituted during the second half because he had been suffering from a virus in the days leading up to the game.",
      "Shaw struggled against Manchester City in the Manchester derby, but his performances have otherwise been strong and he could earn a recall to the England squad later this month.",
      "Gareth Southgate included Shaw in his England squad for Euro 2024. The defender has not received a call-up since that tournament, but his form could be rewarded by Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Amorim spoke at his pre-match press conference on Thursday and was asked whether he believed Shaw deserved a recall to England's squad. \"It's hard, it's hard here, it's hard in Portugal,\" he said.",
      "\"I have the same questions about the players, it's really hard to choose the players. People point a finger at you if you are the national manager, if you choose this one or the other one.",
      "\"And England has a lot of good players, and you can choose two teams to win a World Cup, I know it's tough for you guys, it's harder than Portugal, but it's an opinion.\"",
      "Amorim sympathised with the international selection process, adding: \"It's the way you play, it's the way you see the opponents you have. In the next two games, it will change what kind of player you want to call up. So I think he deserves it, but also a lot of players deserve to be back.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing.\"",
      "Tuchel explained his decision to overlook Shaw during the October international break, saying: “It was a very close call. I just want him to have a little bit more minutes. He looks very fit.",
      "\"He looks very determined. I think he has the quality, the experience to play and to make us better straight away. But I want to keep him back a little bit, when he has more rhythm than he has right now.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana has insisted that he does not fear any opponent on the football pitch and would not define himself as a loser since moving to Trabzonspor on loan in September.",
      "Onana began the season as back-up to Altay Bayindir after suffering an injury during pre-season. The Cameroonian was given his chance to impress against Grimsby Town but a poor performance sealed his fate at Old Trafford.",
      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",
      "\"I never fear anyone. Because in this life, I only fear God,\" he explained.",
      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",
      "\"Coming from Cameroon and playing in Barcelona, Ajax, Inter, Manchester, and now in Trabzonspor is magnificent. Coming from there and looking at today, seeing what I've achieved in the last 10-11 years - amazing, really amazing.",
      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",
      "Onana's Trabzonspor now sit second in the Super Lig table and are just five points behind league leaders Galatasaray. Next up for them is a trip to the table-toppers on Saturday evening.",

      "Dorgu was shown a straight red card in United's 3-2 win over Ipswich Town in February after a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson. The £25million signing got a slight touch on the ball but followed through and caught his opponent late on the top of the shin.",
      "He was initially given a yellow card before England was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. After a brief check, the decision was overturned and Dorgu was sent off.",
      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",
      "This week, the Premier League have announced their match officials appointments for the weekend's action and England will be in charge for United's trip to the City Ground. Scott Ledger and Akil Howson will be his assistants, with Bobby Madley joining the managers in the technical area.",

The players who were unused substitutes against the Seagulls or played limited minutes at the weekend took part in Sunday's training session, as did a number of academy players who were called up to boost the numbers.",
      "The club have released a short video of the training session and MEN Sport picked out three key points from the workout.",
      "Before Brighton, Amorim confirmed that Mason Mount was a doubt for the fixture, which instantly caused concern given his track record with injuries.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls. He took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "As the current back-up goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir was involved in the session along with Tom Heaton. The Turkish goalkeeper took part in a small-sided game with the outfield players.",
      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",

      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",

      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "United lost their three-game winning streak when they drew 2-2 in the league with Nottingham Forest. The Red Devils were 1-0 up at the end of the first half through a Casemiro goal.",
      "But Forest hit twice in the space of two minutes at the start of the second half two go ahead, and though United pulled it back through Amad Diallo with nine minutes of regular time left, securing the draw, they were unable to add a fourth win to their streak.",
      "There are suggestions that Amad’s goal was the best that will be scored all season – he struck the ball on the volley from the edge of the box and it sailed into the right side of the Forest net.",
      "It was Amad’s first goal of the season to go with two assists, in a deeper role – wing back – than he was used to playing prior to Amorim’s arrival at United.",
      "The Ivorian has been challenged to be better than he’s currently being, though, with the manager feeling there is more to come from him.",
      "He said: “Amad has a lot of talent. We have a lot of players who are young and talented. He can be so much better and be more consistent. You could see in first half he had some opportunities. He has potential to do better.”",
      "On the game on the whole, Amorim said: “If I think about game, we lost control for five minutes. I feel in the recent past if we had had this situation [from 1-0 up and 2-1 down] we would have struggled so much more than today.",
      "“My feeling is we played well but we dropped a little bit of energy. When we have the full energy we are the better team. My players are giving everything but we have the potential to do better.",
      "“Sometimes we have these moments. In the end we lost two points and we need to get three points in the next game.”",
      "That was picked up by pundit Nedum Onuoha, who said: “What we’re seeing from Manchester United is the sense of confidence from them. They weren’t flustered when they went 2-1 down and they will believe they can win this game now, which is something we wouldn’t have seen a few weeks ago.”",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030."

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is rattling along now, with a familiar name already roaring into a significant lead in the race for the Golden Boot.",
      "Erling Haaland is bidding to reclaim his crown after he and everyone else got Mo Salahed last season, and it’s so far so good with the Big Norwegian currently boasting a whopping five-goal lead over an unexpected yet distant nearest challenger.",
      "Here are the actual 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",

      "Has scored three goals to make this list, which feels pretty harsh on Danny Welbeck and Jean-Philippe Mateta, who have scored six each.",
      "",
      "Made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign?",
      "",
      "It’s as many Premier League goals this season as Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez, which is something.",
      "",
      "We are pretty confident of two things. One, Woltemade will become a firm cult hero on Tyneside and score a goodly number of goals. Two, that number will not be sufficient to win the Golden Boot, or probably even get that close. Good bit that he’s already scored two headers when all the evidence from Germany was that, despite looking precisely like someone who would score a lot of headers, he doesn’t actually score many headers.",
      "His penalty against Forest was the very definition of ‘aplomb’.",
      "",
      "Proven quality but yet to get off the Premier League mark for his new club following that messy and drawn-out departure from Newcastle.",

      "Has done a hugely admirable job thus far of filling a pretty hefty void at Brentford but missed a huge chance to try and remain halfway close to Haaland early in the second half against City.",

Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half. There was no sign of him adding to that total v Liverpool but he did score v Nottingham Forest and Burnley.",
      "Arsenal’s title challenge is in textbook shape, but there hasn’t been that much contribution from the striker they apparently needed to drag them over the line. The fact that he is already as long as 22s here shows how far he is behind…",
      "",
      "This is looking like hope over experience, with Salah miles off it in what is now officially a struggling, crisis-addled Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Looking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. It’s an absurd lead at this stage, really, with his own nonsense compounded by none of the other most likely contenders – with all due respect to Semenyo – doing anything all that compelling to challenge him.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Erling Haaland could join FC Barcelona for a fee ‘less’ than his valuation as they have ‘found a way’.",

      "Perhaps the best single month in post-Ferguson Manchester United history was enough to coax Jason Wilcox out from the shadows to reluctantly explain how the “clear plan” at Old Trafford was bearing fruit.",
      "The Director of Football shouldered a fraction of the public-facing responsibility Ruben Amorim carries every week, confirming a complete narrative volte-face for a club which had started the season with two wins from seven.",
      "It took just three consecutive victories for the complexion to transform, for the hierarchy to toot their own horn, for Manchester United to go from perennial crisis to Champions League-adjacent. When the bar is lowered towards the core of the actual earth by accepting finishing 15th, any and all positives are magnified.",
      "But as Wilcox said, one of the keys is to “not get too carried away when we win and not get too disappointed when we lose”. It remains to be seen quite what Manchester United do with a draw at Nottingham Forest in a game they should have won and could have lost.",
      "It instinctively feels far more like a point gained than two dropped. The Manchester United of last season would probably lose that game. There is clear development in the mentality and character required to go from a position of relative comfort to a sudden and total collapse.",
      "Casemiro scored from another Dyche-infuriating corner that never was and the visitors seemed in control. Forest had threatened but Luke Shaw in particular was excellent.",
      "Then half time happened. Forest scored twice within the restart as Manchester United crumbled under a couple of high crosses. Morgan Gibbs-White headed in the equaliser to finish a sublime move, before Nicolo Savona nipped in to capitalise on some haphazard defending.",
      "In those moments it is difficult to blame the manager; these were specifically individual player errors. Amad was weak in challenging Gibbs-White, and Diogo Dalot compounded playing Savona onside with reacting far too late to the danger. Amorim has deserved the blame for most of his 19 defeats in a year, but would have ranked far down the list of culprits for his 20th.",
      "That such finger-pointing was ultimately never needed is testament to the power of momentum. It swung so abruptly and violently in Forest’s favour at the start of the second half, but was also something Manchester United could harness once the shock wore off. While the winning streak is over, the confidence and conviction which came from it was evident in the final half an hour.",
      "Amad levelled with a stunning volley and almost secured a stirring win with another effort Murillo blocked on the line in stoppage time. But a chaotic draw in a game with 35 shots almost perfectly equally split between two flawed yet improving teams was a fair result on the balance of play.",
      "Manchester United are a work in progress – left wing-back is becoming a problem position and the expensive assortment of forwards signed this summer need to establish more consistency – but that progress is finally clear to see. A result and performance which won’t lead anyone to “get too carried away” nor “too disappointed” is no bad thing.",
      "READ NEXT: The five ‘right’ signings Manchester United should make after statement of intent",
      "Being dropped should have been the worst part of the day for Xavi Simons. Then Spurs were forced to play the £51m signing who does not fit whatsoever.",
      "Everyone is getting worked up about Arsenal and ‘set-piece goals’. But how do we even define a ‘set-piece goal’ and more importantly does it even matter?",
      "Do you want ‘the truth about Harvey Elliott’s Aston Villa contract and whether he can return to Liverpool in January’? Well you’re absolutely not in luck.",

      "Ruben Amorim is turning things around at Manchester United, with the mood around the club comfortably the best it’s been since he was announced as the new manager, and the manager’s landmark decision for their clash with Nottingham Forest shows why the Red Devils should see Champions League qualification as a very real target this season.",
      "The trip to Forest on Saturday marks the one-year anniversary of Amorim’s appointment at Man Utd and the Portuguese boss admitted in the build-up that he doubted whether he would survive this long at Old Trafford.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe recently moved to quell talk of his sacking, claiming he needed three years to prove he’s a “great” coach, and Amorim accepts there were days when he wondered if he would even get to complete his first year.",
      "“I had some moments that I struggled a lot and I was thinking that maybe it’s not meant to be,” he said. “Today is the opposite. Today I feel that, and I know that, that was the best decision in my life, and I want to be here.”",
      "Amorim has now led United to three Premier League wins on the bounce and into sixth in the table, remarkably above Liverpool, having played their part in plunging the Reds into crisis with their first victory at Anfield in almost a decade.",
      "A clash with Forest, who are currently 18th having dismissed both Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Poetecoglou this term and are now under the leadership of Sean Dyche, offers a great opportunity to make it four wins from four for United and lift them into the coveted Champions League places.",
      "And Amorim celebrated his one-year anniversary by naming an unchanged XI in the Premier League for the very first time in his tenure, in a clear sign of progress which shows why they have a very good chance of qualifying for Europe’s showcase competition.",

      "Signing a dynamic midfielder for Ruben Amorim is at the top of INEOS’ 2026 plans, but Manchester United’s “genuine interest” in Conor Gallagher, as reported by Fabrizio Romano, is as underwhelming as it is baffling.",
      "Casemiro’s uptick in form – evidenced by United conceding just three goal with him on the pitch and 16 goals without him – has made the requirement for a new central midfielder feel less urgent than it was even a couple of weeks ago, but that remains the area of the squad the Old Trafford hierarchy want to strengthen as a priority.",
      "Director of Football Jason Wilcox insists recruitment will be focused on “the right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure”.",
      "“They have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team,” he added.",
      "And while Gallagher – who swapped Chelsea for Atletico Madrid for £34m in the summer of 2024 – unquestionably meets that first requirement and arguably the second too, it’s hard to imagine how he would get into Amorim’s team to make that difference.",
      "It’s claimed the Red Devils were interested in Gallagher as the summer transfer window was coming to a close having asked about the availability of Carlos Baleba and been told by Brighton he would cost them £100m.",
      "But Gallagher is no alternative for Baleba, Elliot Anderson or the other midfielders Man Utd have been linked with of late.",
      "He’s played just three of his 63 games for Atletico Madrid as the defensive midfielder Amorim covets and at Chelsea was far more regularly used in an attacking midfield role, with protection always afforded to him by Enzo Fernandez or Moises Caicedo. Gareth Southgate played him in that deep-lying role for England at the start of Euro 2024 and it was a disaster.",
      "And yet, according to Romano, Gallagher remains very much on United’s radar.",
      "“I told you several times that Man United want to add a midfielder, but in this moment to go for a very expensive midfielder in the January transfer window might be difficult,” Romano told CaughtOffside.",
      "“Players like (Carlos) Baleba maybe are not even available. Same for Angelo Stiller and then there could be opportunities – a name that Manchester United considered in the summer transfer window final days was Connor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid.",
      "“Conor Gallagher remains an option in case Atletico Madrid decide to open doors to a loan move. At the moment Gallagher is only focused on Atletico Madrid. Manchester United’s interest is genuine since August. But Gallagher is one of the options they have in case it could be an opportunity on loan, in case it can be a typical general deal.",
      "“So we will be following the situation. But Gallagher is a name we have to keep there.”",

      "It would be an underwhelming signing. Gallagher was very good in a very bad Chelsea team before departing for La Liga, but he’s a workhorse; in the same ‘safe pair of hands’ category as Mason Mount. He’s started just four games for Atletico this season.",
      "There will be huge doubts as to whether he’s a player who can take Man Utd forward, but above all, questions as to how he would even get in their team.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo isn’t playing as he can’t provide the foil for Bruno Fernandes to thrive as Casemiro or – ostensibly – Manuel Ugarte can. And that would surely also be the case for Gallagher.",
      "We understand Amorim’s desire for hard-working fighters in midfield, but what currently looks like a very wide net they’ve cast to find one needs to be narrowed to only include those who can dovetail with his captain. Conor Gallagher is not that man.",
      "Man Utd are looking to make a huge offer for Atletico Madrid midfielder Conor Gallagher in the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "At times it looked like it wouldn’t happen, but Ruben Amorim has made it to a year in charge of Manchester United.",
      "After the sacking of Erik ten Hag, Man Utd announced on November 1 last year that Amorim would become their new head coach, starting work 10 days later once he finished his Sporting CP tenure. But it hasn’t been plain sailing for Amorim at Old Trafford since then.",
      "Only recently has the Portuguese tactician been able to steer United towards consecutive positive results in the Premier League. They finished 15th under his watch last season and simply have to keep improving from here.",
      "To give themselves a decent chance, they boosted their squad in the summer with a handful of new signings. But their work evolving Amorim’s squad isn’t yet complete.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has suggested Amorim will be given three years to prove himself, so if the co-owner keeps his word, the head coach will still be in situ this time next year too, ready to celebrate a second anniversary of his appointment.",
      "With two transfer windows to go before then, what might Man Utd’s best XI look like this time next year?",
      "Disappointed by the performances of Andre Onana, United faced a goalkeeping transfer dilemma this summer. Ultimately, they chose to look to the future and signed Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Amorim has been patient with the Belgian so far, but he is starting to look like his new first-choice goalkeeper ahead of Altay Bayindir.",
      "Next summer, United will need to work out what to do with Onana after his loan spell at Trabzonspor, but it’s unlikely they’d be reverting to him as a starter.",
      "As long as Lammens doesn’t make too many mistakes over the course of the season, he looks set to be entrusted with the regular starting duties in goal for the long term, having signed a contract until 2030.",
      "There could yet be scope for a more senior keeper to come in and replace him, with Bayindir then making way, but United will be managing their budget carefully and assessing what they’ve already got first.",
      "The defender that United hope will be one of their figureheads for many years, Yoro has been settling into a role on the right-hand side of a back three.",
      "After beating competition from Real Madrid to sign the Frenchman last year, United tied him down to a long-term contract until 2029.",
      "Comfortable on either side of the back three that Amorim favours, Yoro can carve out a defined future for himself on his more natural right-hand side.",
      "Despite joining United to link up with his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag, De Ligt has become a cornerstone of Amorim’s lineups recently.",
      "Generally, the Dutch defender has been stationed as the central defender in the back three, not missing a minute so far this Premier League season.",
      "At the age of 26, the once highly-touted De Ligt is approaching what should be the prime of his career, and it seems as if he’s stabilising his form in time to enjoy it in a settled role with United.",
      "DON’T MISS – The 10 Erik ten Hag signings still at Man Utd and when they could leave",
      "Upgrading at left centre-back would be a luxury for United rather than a necessity, depending on how Lisandro Martinez recovers from his latest injury setback.",
      "He has every chance of fighting for his place, but it can’t be denied that a dream target for United remains Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "So far, they’ve failed to prise him away, with Everton securing him to a new contract in the summer. However, there will reportedly be a release clause active in 2026.",
      "The price will be high, but if United find it reasonable enough and can afford it, the pathway to their dream signing could finally be cleared.",
      "If Branthwaite is out of reach, though, Martinez will likely continue as the main left-sided centre-back.",
      "Although he can also be an option in behind the striker, Amad has gained more gametime as a right wing-back so far this season.",
      "While he’s definitely more ‘wing’ than ‘back’, he has the traits to make that role his own niche in Amorim’s system.",
      "Diogo Dalot or Noussair Mazraoui will likely still be around as more defensive options, but at the age of 23, Amad is ready to take the next steps up in his career and will be aiming to put the pressure on for regular starts by virtue of his performances.",
      "United are dreaming of a midfield transformation in 2026, with sources explaining their plan to sign two new players in the department – ideally one in January and one in the summer.",
      "The preference at first would be someone with Premier League experience, with the likes of Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson on the shortlist.",
      "But Baleba struggled to impress at Old Trafford when visiting with Brighton recently and Forest’s valuation of Anderson is extremely high.",
      "TEAMtalk’s Dean Jones recently named Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton as the player suspected to be the preferred target for United as things stand, although he won’t be easy to buy either.",
      "One of the best English midfielders in the Premier League, Wharton originally hails from Lancashire and could return to the north west with United if they get their way.",
      "A player who can dictate the tempo like he can would be a major boost to Amorim’s midfield, where Manuel Ugarte is struggling to convince, Kobbie Mainoo is unfavoured and Casemiro isn’t getting any younger.",
      "The other midfielder United could face a serious dilemma over next year is their captain, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The role Amorim has been using him in recently doesn’t get the best out of him, but on paper, he remains one of United’s best players – if not the best.",
      "Fernandes has vowed not to make a decision on his club future until after the World Cup, but there’s reportedly a clause in his contract that could lead to him leaving for a foreign club.",
      "Should United get their wish of signing a second midfielder, one candidate who has been heavily tipped for a move is Stuttgart’s Germany international, Stiller.",
      "Jason Wilcox is said to be driving United’s interest in the 24-year-old, who would be more likely to move next summer than in January.",
      "He won’t be too pricey, either, since his release clause will stand at around £35m.",
      "The left wing-back role is starting to stand out as one United could do with an upgrade in. If only they still had Alvaro Carreras…",
      "Patrick Dorgu was the first signing of the Amorim era but the step up from Lecce to Man Utd is substantial and the jury is still out on whether he’ll make it as a success.",
      "Come 2026, there could be scope for United to strengthen with a more senior left-back.",
      "Right now, it’s too early to nail down who the candidates could be. There have been links with Inter’s Federico Dimarco, but he wants to stay with his boyhood club.",
      "Someone else who’s been namechecked in the media is Fulham’s Antonee Robinson, who would bring some proven Premier League quality.",
      "That said, he will turn 29 next summer and still with two years of contract remaining, so it remains to be seen if United would still see him as an ideal profile.",
      "Their scouts will have to keep their eyes on which players emerge as standout left wing-backs over the course of the season before making a more informed decision.",
      "United transformed their attack this summer with three new signings who should set them up for the next few years.",
      "Of the new triple threat, the player who’s made the better early impression has been Mbeumo, who joined from Brentford to become the new right-sided attacking midfielder in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 shape.",
      "From his first 10 games, Mbeumo has scored five goals for United. He’s still only 26, so if he can keep this up, he should be a threat over the coming years.",
      "Man Utd stars Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, manager Ruben Amorim",
      "Operating alongside Mbeumo and in behind the main striker is Cunha, who has been more of a slow burner since his switch from Wolves.",
      "It took until his ninth appearance for Cunha to score his first goal for United, but now that he’s broken his duck, he’ll be aiming to make more of an impact.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Cunha arrived with Premier League experience and is 26 years old, expecting to spend his prime years at Old Trafford.",
      "United capped off their attacking rebuild by signing Sesko as their new centre-forward, deciding against going for a more experienced option.",
      "It’s now over to the Slovenian to showcase his worth and justify United’s decision to pick out a player with long-term potential up front, just as they tried with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee before only to be underwhelmed.",
      "Sesko has only scored twice from his first 10 games for United, but time will be on his side to step up – and besides, he arrived on the back of better seasons than Hojlund or Zirkzee before their moves.",
      "If Sesko doesn’t hit the mark, there might be calls for United to sign a more proven goalscorer – in fact, they might need a reliable veteran to back him up anyway, moving Zirkzee on – but this season will be practically all his to solidify his status.",

      "He became the club’s priority candidate after Erik ten Hag’s poor start to last season, after the Dutchman was handed a contract extension on the back of winning the FA Cup.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has since admitted it was a mistake to retain Ten Hag, and a report from The Athletic has detailed the process in that summer when he signed a new deal which saw the Man Utd chiefs scour the managerial market to identify a replacement, which very nearly saw De Zerbi take the reins at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s claimed their analysis of candidates at the time was focused on them ‘playing an attacking 4-3-3 system’ similar to the one used by Ten Hag, and there was ‘an emphasis on previous Premier League experience’.",
      "It led them to draw up a six-man shortlist featuring Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "‘Informal contact was made with all of them’ but Tuchel and De Zerbi were ‘the prime candidates’, with Amorim not considered owing to his tactical system and lack of Premier League experience.",

Tuchel came across incredibly well, but no terms were agreed and the German wasn’t ready for the United job. He was to take a short break from football after a difficult time at Bayern Munich that led to him leaving that club only the previous month.",
      "‘So De Zerbi became the frontrunner, and financial terms were discussed with the Italian in line with what United felt was fair. Those terms were rejected, and the club chose not to improve them.’",
      "In the end, Man Utd stuck with Ten Hag having failed to agree terms with a manager they deemed suitable to take over at the time, before ripping up their blueprint following his poor start to the campaign and plumping for a man with no Premier League experience, who plays a completely different formation in Amorim.",

      "When asked by our friends at Planet Football who he would sign if he was in Arteta shoes, Ornstein replied Mbappe.",
      "“It’s not about who they will sign, but who I think would fit in nicely,” he said.",
      "For Liverpool, Ornstein feels Arne Slot should move again for a player they almost signed in the summer.",
      "“Marc Guehi. They wanted to get him but didn’t manage to at the last-minute of transfer deadline day but it could happen in the future.”",
      "Indeed, Guehi was undergoing a medical as the clock ticked down to the deadline at the end of the summer window. But Crystal Palace felt unable to find a replacement in the limited time available so the Eagles pulled the plug on a £35million deal.",
      "Guehi, most likely, will go free at the end of the season but Liverpool are sure to have competition for the England defender, with Real Madrid among the clubs also interested in the Palace captain.",
      "Turning his attention to Chelsea, Ornstein feels the Blues should look to raid Real and take back the La Liga leaders’ goalkeeper.",
      "“Thibaut Courtois. He’s been there before but I think they could take a world-class goalkeeper.”",
      "Indeed they could. Chelsea have struggled to find a reliable stopper since selling Courtois to Real in 2018.",
      "The Belgian, however, left under a cloud after forcing through his move, which is just one of the reasons a return would be unlikely.",
      "Ornstein’s choice for Tottenham seems a more realistic piece of buisness.",
      "“Jarrad Branthwaite. They’ve been looking for a while to upgrade in the centre of the defence, they have looked at Branthwaite.",
      "“He’s been linked with a move away from Everton even though he’s signed a new contract and I guess he’s one to watch for many of the top clubs.”",
      "Ornstein also feels Manchester City should maintain their interest in a forward they were reported to be keen on during the summer.",
      "“Rodrygo, because they looked at him and if Savinho had left, they might have made a push for him. And I think it would be exciting to see Rodygo or even Vinicius Jr in the Premier League.”",
      "Lastly, turning his attention to Manchester United, Ornstein reckons the Red Devils should pursue again Carlos Beleba.",
      "“They want him, he wants them, Brighton do not want to let him go but we’ll see what the future holds.",
      "“They have to upgrade in the no.6 department. Ruben Amorim wants to, and that could help complete their rebuild.”",
      "Even though Casemiro appears to have rediscovered his mojo? Yes, because the Brazilian is out of contract in the summer and there’s no chance of United taking their option to extend for an extra season on the terms Sir Jim Ratcliffe is angry the club ever agreed to when they signed the midfielder from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "🚨 Weekend football quiz from Planet Football: Arsenal wonderkids, Guti’s backheel, PL hat-tricks…",

      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Manchester United exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed.",
      "Onana joined Man Utd from Inter Milan for £47m in the summer of 2023 but was allowed to leave the club in September after his less than convincing displays for the Red Devils last season.",
      "A four-game winning run has moved Trabzonspor into second place in the Turkish Super Lig and Onana hasn’t tasted defeat for his new club since his debut loss against Fenerbahce.",
      "And Trabzonspor correspondent Hasan Tuncel was full of praise for the 29-year-old when asked for his assessment of his performances, describing his contribution as “flawless”.",
      "“In one word: outstanding,” Tuncel said. “Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "“A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out – he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.”",
      "“From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "“His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal – he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "“So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "“He personally mentors three young goalkeepers – Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak – guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.”",

      "On how Onana was welcomed to the club, Tuncel added: “In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion – but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,” he revealed.",
      "“We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "“Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.’ That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "“Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster – and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.”",
      "Despite Onana’s excellent form, it’s unlikely Trabzonspor will have the wherewithal to complete his permanent signing",
      "Tuncel continued: “The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,” Tuncel admitted.",
      "“However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "“For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and aid their development. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would certainly love to keep him on a permanent basis.”",
      "Here is our ranking of every Premier League No.2 goalkeeper. Liverpool will need to call on theirs soon to make his English top-flight bow due to injury.",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",

      "They’ve won a few trophies and there were some good times under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Erik ten Hag, along with other glimmers of joy, but the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the sinking Old Trafford ship while Liverpool simultaneously plunge into crisis has created a satisfaction stew which might just have made October 2025 the most enjoyable month for a Manchester United fan since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out in support of Amorim when reports of his sacking and talk of possible replacements were still rife despite a face-saving victory over Sunderland at the start of the month.",
      "The co-owner said he needed three years at Old Trafford to prove he’s a “great” coach; we gave him three weeks, still wholly unconvinced both by Amorim’s ability to turn things around and by the veracity of Ratcliffe’s backing of a manager with the worst record of any Man Utd boss since the halcyon Fergie days. But what a three weeks it’s been.",
      "Having incredibly failed to win consecutive Premier League games since joining the club last November, Amorim’s now won three(?!) on the bounce, with victory over fourth-placed Sunderland followed by their first win at Anfield in nearly a decade and then their latest triumph, over Brighton.",
      "And they were proper wins too, featuring some tactical nuance, game management, surprising confidence and some outstanding performances from summer signings to shift the narrative in dramatic fashion, to the point where we’re wondering what’s stopping United from qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "No midweek football thanks to the Europa League final and Grimsby Town defeats, while meaning scant opportunity for backups like Kobbie Mainoo, is granting Amorim plenty of time on the training ground with the players to hone ideas and implement a philosophy which they now appear to be finally getting to grips with.",
      "Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal and Casemiro’s rejuvenation has, at least for the time being, put a stop to claims Amorim and United were doomed to perpetual false dawns at best until they signed a new No.6. Rumours of interest in Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and others have been conspicuous by their absence in the last couple of weeks.",
      "The centre-backs are all playing well, with the question now not which three are less likely to screw up but which in-form defender Amorim should leave out. Lisandro Martinez’s return looks set to raise those standards even higher.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are doing excellent work in relieving the creative pressure on the shoulders of Bruno Fernandes, who looks increasingly like the leader of Man Utd rather than a guy whining while wearing an armband.",
      "And although the jury may still be out on Benjamin Sesko, it’s testament to the work of his fellow forwards that he’s being allowed the space to ease into life in the Premier League rather than being harangued for not scoring regular goals as Rasmus Hojlund was.",
      "It’s all going swimmingly for them, and whether because of some mystical requirement for one of the two greatest English teams to be in crisis at any one time, or simply thanks to a glorious twisting of fates for the Red Devils, the aversion of their club emergency has coincided with Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming fully fledged in October.",
      "It’s seen the Reds lose three Premier League games before dumped out of the Carabao Cup, making it six defeats in seven. Mohamed Salah has lost it. Virgil van Dijk might just be past it. Their two £100m+ players have been stratospheric flops. And Arne Slot, while making excuses that would make Jurgen Klopp or Arsene Wenger blush having been a beacon of objectivity last season, is now second in the sack race. Amorim is eighth.",
      "Having been eight points behind Liverpool after five games, after nine Man Utd are above them. And while we can’t yet know whether October 2025 will act as a line in the sand, the point when Amorim’s Man Utd truly discovered their identity before going on to great things while Slot’s Liverpool scrabbled to recover theirs to no avail before his sacking, there’s no doubt that it’s been a standout month for Red Devils fans in the post-Sir Alex era; maybe the most enjoyable of all.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030."

He then thought he'd hit a 94th-minute winner only to be denied by a goalline block by Murillo, capping a game packed with drama.",
      "United had led at half-time through a controversial Casemiro opener which sparked fury around the City Ground. The officials had awarded a corner when replays did not conclusively show all of the ball had crossed the line and the Brazilian subsequently headed in.",
      "\"It's not out,\" said former Premier League referee Mike Dean on Soccer Saturday. \"The ball is nowhere near out. It's just a guess by the referee.\"",
      "Forest had conceded from a corner which should have been given as a goal-kick at Bournemouth last weekend.",

Two decisions that are not right have gone against us in a week. Yes, of course, we then have to deal with the situation which we didn't do as well.

We need to work to bring the same away from home as we do in our stadium.",
      "\"We are getting better. Everyone can see. We are getting that feeling that if we can't win, at least we aren't going to lose. The way we press, the urgency with certain things, I think we did better last Sunday. We need to be like that in every game.\"",
      "On Amad's equaliser: \"It's something good for the fans. It was a really important goal for us. But I'm more focused on the 90 minutes. And what we did good. That's what I'll tell the players. Sometimes I forget that part and I judge the players when I see the games. But, we are doing things right. We are controlling the game. Of course we can do so much to grow.

      "\"It's hard to say. We need to think positively, but we also need to be prepared that football is [up and down]. And we are not that team that I can say to you, no, no, no.",
      "\"Now we can lose here or there, but we are going to maintain. I trust in my players more. I think they trust me more. That will come with wins. And you can sense that because everyone now is saying that, how connected they are and they believe in the manager.",

      "In a statement explaining why there is only one Boxing Day fixture this season, the Premier League said: \"There are now several challenges to Premier League fixture scheduling rooted in the expansion of European club competitions - which led to a revision of our domestic calendar ahead of last season, including changes to the FA Cup.",
      "\"This ultimately left the Premier League as a 33-weekend competition - fewer than previous seasons, despite being a 380-match competition since 1995. With fewer weekends to work with, the League is bound by how the calendar falls.",
      "\"The League can give an assurance that next season there will be more Premier League matches on Boxing Day - as the date falls on a Saturday.\"",
      "On December 27, Chelsea's home game with Aston Villa will be the Saturday Night Football fixture at 5.30pm. There is a Super Sunday double header on December 28 - Sunderland vs Leeds at 2pm and Crystal Palace vs Tottenham Hotspur at 4.30pm.",
      "Six games will be taking place on Tuesday December 30 - including Arsenal's home game with Aston Villa. Four games are on the evening of New Year's Day - Man Utd vs Wolves, Crystal Palace vs Fulham, Liverpool vs Leeds and Brentford vs Spurs, a fixture which marks Thomas Frank's return to the Bees.",
      "And the following midweek will see all 10 Premier League games shown live on Sky, including Arsenal vs Liverpool on Thursday January 8 - kick-off at 8pm- in what could be a huge game to decide where the title goes this season.",

      "Newcastle's £69m striker Nick Woltemade is contributing more than goals as Alexander Isak starts slowly at Liverpool; The Radar column also looks at the man-management techniques being used by Fabian Hurzeler on Charalampos Kostoulas and Brighton's other young players",
      "Friday 31 October 2025 12:25, UK",
      "",
      "💪 Woltemade's strong start for Newcastle🔹 Kostoulas being challenged by Hurzeler🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Nick Woltemade scored his third header of the season in Newcastle's Carabao Cup win over Spurs on Wednesday. The 6ft 6in striker is proving difficult to handle. And not just aerially.",
      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",
      "As is becoming increasingly clear to his new audience, though, he is also an excellent technician capable of a light touch as well as brute force. He is comfortable holding onto the ball in tight spaces. He drops deep and pulls wide to link the play. He can even dribble.",
      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map hints at a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morato inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."

      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",

      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",

It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Thursday 30 October 2025 09:23, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
