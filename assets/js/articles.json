      "Alejandro Garnacho assisted two Chelsea goals against Wolverhampton Wanderers hours after Ruben Amorim voiced his disappointment that Manchester United did not beat Tottenham Hotspur. Garnacho was named in the starting line-up and shone at Stamford Bridge, recording his first two Premier League assists since departing Old Trafford with two crosses from the left flank.",
      "His opening contribution was a precise delivery onto the head of Malo Gusto, who powered it home from close range to give the Blues a lead. The second capped off a devastating counter-attack, teeing up Pedro Neto to find the net against his old club and stretch the advantage to 3-0.",
      "Enzo Maresca heaped praise on the summer acquisition after the final whistle. \"He's doing very well on the ball,\" the Chelsea head coach said, \"but he's doing very, very well off the ball.",
      "\"He knows that to play with us, he has to be good on the ball and off the ball; otherwise, he's not going to play. We are very happy with him at this moment.\"",
      "Alan Shearer also highlighted his display on Match of the Day. \"I was really impressed with him. He scored in midweek (against Qarabag in the Champions League).",
      "\"I think it was his best game today. He caused problems all evening down the left-hand side.",
      "\"Whoever was coming up against him, he had more pace than them; he went past them with ease, and he was a real threat in putting balls, good balls, into the box for his forwards, and of course, they benefited from that. I thought he looked really, really comfortable.\"",
      "Earlier that day in north London, Amorim had been criticising United for becoming too relaxed after taking a 1-0 lead at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Bryan Mbeumo put United ahead just past the half-hour mark, but they failed to build on their lead.",
      "Mathys Tel brought Spurs level late on, before Richarlison turned the game around for the home side. Matthijs de Ligt's equaliser salvaged a point, but United had been in front for 52 of the 98 minutes played, trailing for just five.",
      "Amorim admitted afterwards that all three points were there for the taking. \"I think, if you see the game, you feel that the three points were there to take home,\" he said, before adding: \"If you look at the game and if you feel the environment, we have so much to grow as a team, because today was our day to win this game.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"I think it's more we need to look at ourselves. We were not pressing with the same intensity because we felt comfortable.",
      "\"We need to understand that, but to feel also that, if we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game.\" He concluded: \"We need to feel the environment of the game and feel that the opponent is nervous, so we need to kill the game and not wait until the end.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could be compelled to dive into the January transfer market for attacking reinforcements following Benjamin Sesko's concerning knock sustained during Saturday's 2-2 draw – but are their hands tied regarding Rasmus Hojlund's return from his Napoli stint?",
      "Forward Sesko entered the fray from the substitutes' bench in the 58th minute against Tottenham, yet endured merely thirty minutes on the pitch. The striker was withdrawn after a tackle from Micky van de Ven whilst bearing down on goal.",
      "Following medical attention for a knee problem, Sesko made his way directly towards the tunnel. Thankfully, Ruben Amorim's side salvaged a point courtesy of Matthijs de Ligt's dramatic late leveller.",
      "\"We have to check,\" Amorim said when asked about the injury. \"He had something in his knee, let's see.\"",
      "When questioned whether it represented a serious setback, the Portuguese manager added: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Hojlund remains contracted to United, with the Denmark striker currently on loan at Napoli in Italy. The 22-year- old has netted four times in nine outings for the Serie A title holders.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has reported that the temporary deal features an option which could transform into an obligation, though those connected to the arrangement consider it 'guaranteed' should they secure Champions League qualification.",
      "This means United have no recall clause available should they opt to engineer his return to Old Trafford during January.",
      "Prior to the Spurs clash, rumours had suggested United were eyeing a new striker to provide competition for Sesko during the campaign's latter stages.",

      "\"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" Amorim said when questioned about United's transfer plans. \"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew.",

      "\"He had two really, really good chances and should have scored, to be honest. They worked it really well for him to get in the first time. He's either got to get his shot away early or he's got to push that ball forward quicker. He's not going to get that amount of time in the Premier League to work it back on his right foot.\"",

      "Danny Welbeck left Manchester United after nearly a decade to join rivals Arsenal and is now a prolific goal scorer for Brighton. The English striker never could've predicted the twists and turns his career has taken since his senior professional debut in 2008.",
      "Welbeck was handed his first start by Sir Alex Ferguson against Middlesbrough in the League Cup and made the majority of his United appearances under the iconic manager. The Red Devils academy star played 142 games for his boyhood club, scoring 29 goals, but appearances declined when Louis van Gaal arrived in 2014.",
      "Welbeck made 33 appearances for David Moyes during his time as manager, but played just three times for Van Gaal out of position, prompting him to seek a new challenge elsewhere. Arsenal made the move on the final day of the summer transfer window and secured Welbeck's signature for £16million.",
      "This transfer was a bittersweet moment for the striker, who had been at Old Trafford since the age of eight, but it was a decision that felt necessary. Discussing the reason he left United, Welbeck said: \"At the time I was playing on the left-wing a lot and in a 4-4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can't make an impact on the game.",
      "\"I can play it to the best of my ability but that’s not best for the team, and I could make a bigger impact playing in my preferred position.",
      "\"You start to have thoughts but at that time you're still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game - that's just me, I'm not going to change that. But you do start to think about what's best for you.\"",
      "The centre forward made 126 appearances for the Gunners, scoring 32 goals - three of which came against his old club in Manchester. Welbeck won two FA Cups with the north London side, working under Arsene Wenger and Unai Emery before being released in 2019.",
      "Watford signed Welbeck on a free transfer that summer, and he scored three goals in 20 appearances before leaving the club just one year later. However, in 2020, a new club came calling in the form of Brighton, and the rest, as they say, is history.",
      "Welbeck is still starring for the Seagulls to this day, scoring six goals in the Premier League already this season. So far, the 34-year-old has made 173 appearances for Brighton, netting 43 goals and assisting 17 times - far surpassing his tallies at United, Arsenal and Watford.",
      "Many wouldn't be able to predict Welbeck's resurgence at the Premier League side, given their typical transfer model that targets young and unproven stars. The veteran striker will be glad that the Seagulls took a chance on him five years ago, as he continues to shine in both domestic and European competition, 17 years on from his debut.",

      "Barcelona sporting director Deco has revealed that the club aren't planning to make any new signings in January, suggesting their all of their 2026 business will be done next summer. Barca only made three first-team additions this year, including Marcus Rashford.",
      "The La Liga champions signed Rashford, 28, on a season-long loan from Manchester United. During negotiations, Barcelona inserted an option to buy him permanently at the end of this season for €30million (£26m).",
      "So far, the England international has encouraged Barca chiefs that he'll be worth it. Rashford has scored six goals and provided five assists in 15 appearances, most of which have come from the left wing.",
      "But given their precarious financial predicament, the Catalan heavyweights intend to see out the season before making any decisions. That's why Deco currently has no plans for January.",
      "Speaking at an event on Friday, as Barcelona held an open training session at the newly renovated - but still under construction - Camp Nou, Deco said: \"If we are doing well and there are no surprises, I don't think it's necessary.",
      "\"We know exactly where we can improve and the difficulties we face. Last season, we also went through some difficult moments and we were able to overcome them,\" Deco added, with Hansi Flick's side having won just three of their last seven games since the start of October.",
      "\"When we lower the intensity, we suffer. We need to have the best players. There are no excuses, but when you can't make changes because of injuries and they affect our midfield. There are things to improve even when we win.\"",
      "Flick thinks that Rashford can do even more to help Barca get into their stride this season, with the United loanee having scored in their 3-1 win at home to Elche last weekend. \"When you see the chances he has, one or two goals more will be good, also for him,\" Flick explained.",
      "\"But we can be happy with him, of course. I am very happy with him. He can play on this level and I am happy he shows it, for the fans and for the club, and also for the teammates he is a very important player.\"",
      "Rashford will be hoping to add to his goal tally when Barca travel to Celta Vigo on Sunday. The 28-year-old has scored at Celta's stadium, the Estadio de Balaidos, before. Rashford netted a spectacular free-kick to give United a 1-0 victory in their Europa League semi-final first leg in 2017.",

      "Amorim's men opened the scoring after 32 minutes through Bryan Mbeumo and held on until six minutes from time, when Mathys Tel levelled things. Spurs' Richarlison thought he'd won the match but De Ligt had other ideas.",
      "The closing stages of this 2-2 draw were played without Benjamin Sesko. The striker, who arrived this summer from RB Leipzig for £74million, replaced Noussair Mazraoui in the 58th minute but after squandering an opportunity in the 85th, limped off with a leg injury and left United with 10 men for the final moments.",
      "Before the clash against Tottenham, Amorim was asked about Sesko's early tenure as a United player. The Slovenian has scored just twice this season and his head coach admits he has struggled.",
      "His problems are expected to continue after limping out of that draw with a knee injury.",
      "\"I'm relaxed. He's not relaxed,\" said Amorim, before dropping Sesko from the starting XI against Tottenham. \"He has no experience here, and then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing – and you hear about that with Sesko – and then you come to one club that is the hardest club.",
      "\"To have the ability to understand that is normal and still maintain your level of confidence is really hard for a young kid, especially for a young kid that is a control freak. He wants to control everything, and he's not going to control everything.",

      "Mbeumo continued his fine run of form in north London, opening the scoring with a deft header just after 30 minutes. However, the club could be without him for a stretch of games in late December.",
      "The Cameroonian is due to report for international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations on December 21 and would miss at least two matches. But according to The Sun, United would like to strike a deal with Cameroon in order to allow Mbeumo to play in games against Bournemouth on December 13 and Aston Villa on December 21.",
      "It is thought the club will appeal to the Cameroon FA, led by former Chelsea striker Samuel Eto'o, and ask that Mbeumo remain in England until after these matches have concluded.",
      "Sources indicate that Eto'o and Co. are open to negotiation surrounding this issue, which could mean Mbeumo arrives late for Cameroon's opening fixture against Gabon on December 24. Regardless, should Cameroon progress in the competition, Mbeumo could be missing up until the final on January 18.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has been told he was ‘not ready’ for Manchester United after his injury setback. The Slovenian striker started as a substitute in the Red Devils’ 2-2 draw with Tottenham in North London.",
      "However, he lasted less than half-an-hour before he was taken off with an injury. Former United and Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov gave his verdict on the Slovenian and suggested that he was not as prepared as he could have been ahead of coming on.",
      "Speaking to Premier League Productions, Berbatov said: “I want to be supportive, I sympathise with his situation. Yes, he needed to do better, maybe take the ball more to his left foot so this way it eliminates the defender, but we cannot take away the tackle from Mickey van de Ven as well, great, great tackle.",
      "“Maybe that lack of confidence, playing minutes, it affects a player. Then when you get injured out of it, it shows maybe you are not ready to step into the game at full speed.”",
      "Meanwhile, former Spurs star Jermain Defoe had a very similar opinion of Sesko’s outing and suggested he was not ready to take to the pitch. He added: “I said before the game, for a centre forward…",
      "\"When you’re rested or dropped, whatever it is, you’re not in the team and you’re disappointed, but make sure you’re ready to come on, because you can change the game, you get a moment or a chance and you can change the game.",
      "“I’m not saying it was an easy chance because it was a great tackle, but at the same time, when you go through it’s conviction. The first touch always makes the goal, if you take the ball away from the defender then you can go and finish.",
      "“When he watches it back he’ll be disappointed, he didn’t actually have a shot at goal and he ends up getting injured but that’s why you have to be ready to come on and make an impact.”",
      "Sesko’s afternoon lasted less than half an hour and Ruben Amorim has revealed that he would undergo further testing for a potential knee injury. Speaking after the full-time whistle, he said:“We have to check, he had something in his knee. We have to see.”",
      "The United boss added: “Because it’s the knee we never know [how serious the injury is]. We need Ben to be a better team.”",

Pressed on whether the issue was significant, Amorim responded: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Sesko squandered two promising opportunities against Spurs when presented with decent scoring chances, though Amorim dismissed suggestions that a confidence crisis was the root cause. He remarked: \"No, I think... I think that is not the biggest concern now.",
      "\"That happened in the same way that he is not scoring and then he scores two goals in the next two games [Brentford and Sunderland ], so that happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "United face the prospect of losing Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations in December, a situation that has led Amorim to suggest the club might enter the January transfer market.

      "Bryan Mbeumo has been likened to Mohamed Salah following his latest goal for Manchester United. The summer signing from Brentford opened the scoring in United's dramatic 2-2 draw with Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo bagged his fifth goal in as many appearances against Spurs and his sixth in 12 appearances since joining the Red Devils for £71million. The Cameroon international is Ruben Amorim's top goalscorer so far this season and is earning plenty of plaudits from former Premier League players as a result of his fine form.",
      "Peter Crouch and Owen Hargreaves are the latest ex-pros quick to point out that the United star is capable of more than scoring goals. Former Liverpool forward Crouch believes he's been a big signal of intent from United. \"I've been impressed with him for a number of years now,\" he said on TNT Sport.",
      "\"At Brentford, he was a killer, he is a danger, he's sharp with his touches. Today he played right in front of us, and he's so sharp. When he gets a chance, invariably, he finishes, he's cold in front of goal, and he's been such a big addition to what Manchester United are trying to do.\"",
      "Hargreaves, formerly of Manchester United, went a step further and compared his style to Liverpool star Salah. The Egyptian has bagged 188 goals in 298 Premier League outings for the Reds.",
      "Hargreaves reckons the ability Mbeumo has shown to not be daunted by the demands of Old Trafford is impressive. \"I think his biggest attribute is that he gives quality,\" he said.",
      "\"He reminds me a little bit of Mo Salah in and around the box. When he gets it, he has a clear picture of exactly what he wants. He almost shows no emotion, business in and around the box.",
      "\"You can play into his feet, he can dribble. Technically, I don't think he gets enough credit.",
      "\"People talk about his goal-scoring, rightly so, but he's an exceptional football player. People come to Manchester United, huge names, and struggle with pressure. He just sits there super calm, super chill, top scorer this season.\"",
      "Mbeumo was pleased to see his team continue their unbeaten run. United have not lost since defeat to Brentford in September.",
      "\"I think it brings confidence when we don't lose,\" Mbeumo said. \"It's easier on the pitch, outside of the pitch, on the training ground, everybody is enjoying it a lot.\"",

      "Thomas Frank has defended his Tottenham substitutions despite boos from some supporters during Saturday afternoon's game against Manchester United. The North London side battled to a 2-2 draw with the Red Devils on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Frank’s former Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo gave the Red Devils the lead only for late goals from substitutes Mathys Tel and Richarlison to flip the game on its head. A late header from Matthijs de Ligt ensured a share of the spoils.",
      "Frank, who was only appointed in the summer, was on the receiving end of criticism from those inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The decision to substitute Xavi Simons with goalscorer Tel with 11 minutes remaining was roundly booed by the home fans.",
      "But Frank has continued to defend his decisions and insists that every change he makes is in an effort to secure victory. Speaking in his post-match press conference, he said: \"Sometimes you are lucky but of course, I would say that every single time I take a decision to sub a player, it is with one aim: to make the team win, or back in the game, or try to see the game out of whatever.",
      "\"One aim: try to win the game. No doubt Mathys did well, great goal, great involvement and in general I think we played a fine game, positive, but also you need a little bit of freshness.\"",
      "Asked if he heard the fans booing, he replied: “I just say every time I make a decision it is with one aim. To make the team better.”",
      "One of Frank’s other decisions throughout the game was to take Argentine defender Cristian Romero off. But the Tottenham boss has confirmed that his withdrawal was just precautionary.",
      "Frank added: “Yeah, he was just done physically. He just came back from that injury. He's fine.”",
      "The Tottenham boss was also asked if his exit could potentially have had an impact on De Ligt’s eventual goal but insists it would have made very little difference.",
      "He said: “Yeah, but I think his position, he wouldn't have been near the goal anyway, so it's a cross on the side, and then he would have been in the middle zone, so this was back post, so that wouldn't have affected anything.”",

      "For United, the biggest concern was Benjamin Sesko's departure. The striker was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute but lasted just half an hour after suffering a knee problem.",

The 19-year-old was involved in a National League Cup fixture against Tamworth for the Reds' Under-21s in mid-August when he sustained a head injury just before half-time, leading to the match being called off as there was no replacement ambulance available after he was rushed to hospital.",

      "Earlier this week, the club's U21 boss Travis Binnion provided an update on Kone's progress, confirming that the youngster is set to play again after the November international break.",
      "\"After the international break, we think he will be ready to play, which will be good,\" Binnion told the BBC.",
      "\"He has not been able to do contact, which limits the work we can do, but he's back in full training now, and we will get a body of training back into him, with contact.\"",

      "Asked about his form, the United boss said: “Yeah, I'm relaxed – he’s not relaxed. What I mean is that I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle.",
      "“That is normal. He has no experience here, and then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing, and you hear about that with Sesko, and then you come to one club that is the hardest club. If you don't perform every week, you are going to hear a lot of things from club legends, from pundits, from the media, and sometimes they are right.",
      "“To have the ability to understand that is normal and still maintain your level of confidence is really hard for a young kid, especially for a young kid that is a control freak, wants to control everything, and he's not going to control everything.",
      "“So, I know, and I say that when I start training with Ben, he has more potential than I was thinking. He’s going to struggle, and we need to understand how he likes to play also to put in our ideas.",
      "“So, [with] everything, I think I'm quite relaxed with that. He is going to be our striker for the long term. But he's going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride, and that is a normal thing in football.”",

      "Manchester United managed to scrape a draw in the Premier League against Tottenham, despite being down to ten men for the closing stages after suffering injuries. Bryan Mbeumo netted the opener, but Mathys Tel and Richarlison's strikes seemed to secure victory for Spurs until Matthijs de Ligt levelled the score in the final moments of the match.",
      "Ruben Amorim's team entered the game on a four-match unbeaten streak, largely to consistency developed from minimal changes to the starting line-up. However, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire and Patrick Dorgu came in for Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro and Benjamin Sesko on Saturday.",
      "A minor issue also led to a change on their bench, with Kobbie Mainoo missing out for fellow academy graduate Jack Fletcher. This doubled the members on United's injury list, with Lisandro Martinez already side-lined due to a severe knee injury.",
      "Within 17 minutes at Spurs, this escalated to four potential injury concerns, as Maguire seemed to pull his hamstring and Sesko was forced off the pitch, leaving United a man short as Amorim had used up all his substitutions.",
      "With this in mind, Mirror Sport has examined the latest United injury updates as the November international break looms.",
      "Just over half-an-hour after being brought on by Amorim, Sesko sustained an injury which saw him immediately head for the tunnel. The problem seemed to occur when he stretched to take a shot, quickly sitting down on the pitch after his attempt, receiving treatment and then limping off.",
      "Maguire was seen on camera holding his hamstring after a tussle with Richarlison. He tried to play on, but was clearly in discomfort, leading to his substitution by Yoro after 72 minutes.",
      "Mainoo was noticeably absent from United's pre-game train journey down to London on Friday and unsurprisingly he was also missing from the matchday squad. The Athletic later reported that a minor injury would rule him out of the Tottenham game.",
      "Martinez, who has returned to team training at Carrington, is nearing a return from the serious knee injury he suffered in February. \"He wants to go to this one,\" the United head coach said of Martinez last week before the Forest match. \"He is not going to, he is going to take time.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has slammed Manchester United and Tottenham for a “poor” game that was “lacking quality”. The two sides came together at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday afternoon and fought to a dramatic draw.",
      "Red Devils star Bryan Mbeumo had given his side the lead in the first-half, with Mathys Tel and Richarlison seemingly sealing three points for Tottenham late on. But Matthijs De Ligt nodded home a brilliant stoppage time header to secure a share of the points.",
      "Despite the drama, Shearer was not particularly convinced with the performances of each side. Speaking to Match of the Day, the former Newcastle star said: “A draw was probably a fair result in the end. But the standard of football was pretty poor for both teams.",
      "“The substitutes made a difference for Spurs but not for Manchester United. The visitors going down to 10 men after Benjamin Sesko’s injury definitely didn’t help.",
      "“But the quality was lacking, especially for two sides that could have gone second in the league if they had won today.”",
      "Man United boss Ruben Amorim gave his verdict on the game shortly after the full-time whistle and claimed that his side should actually have secured victory. He said: \"During the game we felt like the three points were there to take home.",
      "“But then with everything that happened, Harry Maguire and Casemiro coming off and conceding two goals... we scored again and it's a point.",
      "\"When you cannot win you don't lose, once again we did that. We have so much to grow as a team, because today was our day to win this game.",
      "\"We need to look at ourselves, we were not pressing with the same intensity, we felt comfortable but we need to understand that if we had more bravery we kill the game. But sometimes this happens, you have a better first half than second. We believe in our capacity to score goals until the last minute.\"",
      "Saturday’s draw leaves Spurs third in the table ahead of the November international break, albeit they could have been above Manchester City had they held on for victory. Meanwhile, United sit seventh, having recovered from their poor start to the season.",
      "Amorim’s side are back in action in a fortnight’s time as they host Everton at Old Trafford. Spurs’ next assignment pits them against North London rivals Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium.",

      "Tottenham pushed for an equaliser at the beginning of the second half. They have struggled at home this season, but they finally found a breakthrough thanks to Mathys Tel. Richarlison thought he had secured the win in stoppage time but Matthijs de Ligt struck in the 96th minute to grab a point for United.",
      "Here are how United's players rated in London:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Wasn't switched on at the start of the game but focused his mind in the first half and started the second half by making two superb saves. Couldn't stop either of Tottenham's goals. 6",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Looked pumped from the first whistle, running over to the away section and applauding. He performed well in the centre of the back three and made important interceptions. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman has recalled Matthijs de Ligt to the national side for the upcoming international break. De Ligt deserved that recall, but was at fault for the equaliser. Then redeemed himself with a heroic header. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Stepped into the midfield at times which meant the shape sometimes looked like a back four. Shaw played ok, but was on the pitch for the late collapse. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Pressed aggressively which earned him applause from Amorim. It didn't feel fair to bring him off in the 59th minute when Patrick Dorgu seemed the logical change. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Started the game by playing a few loose passes and couldn't help United see out the victory. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was not at his best in the centre of the pitch. Looked sluggish and wasn't combative enough against Spurs' midfielders. Played the corner into the box for De Ligt's goal. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Struggled in moments during the first half. He replaced Diogo Dalot in the starting team, but still looks raw and unconvincing. His final ball around the box must improve. 4",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Unplayable at times. Finished brilliantly to open the scoring and now has four goals in his last four games. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Got in the way of Matheus Cunha which denied his teammate a chance on goal, but played a clever cross into the box for Mbeumo's goal. Later moved to right wing-back. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Was the same as Fernandes - not at his best against Tottenham. Was booked at the start of the second half for kicking the ball away. 5",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "A couple of half chances not taken. 4",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Allowed Pape Sarr to run past him for Tottenham's goal. Weak. 2",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Tried his best. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did ok after slotting in. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot",

      "Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring with an impressive header in the first half. Up until the last six minutes, the Reds looked like they were going to win the game but Mathys Tel's deflected strike and Richarlison's header put them on the brink of defeat.",

      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Spurs' reminder",
      "There's no forgetting what happened back in May when United faced Tottenham - and Spurs are making sure of it. Walking on the High Road side of the stadium, you pass one of the main receptions. Peak inside and the Europa League trophy is on full display with fans at 9am queuing for photos with it.",
      "It took the home supporters less than three minutes to chant ‘Champions of Europe, we know what we are’. That returned in added time before De Ligt silenced them.",
      "United defensive fluidity",
      "United were at their fluid best in the first half. When Spurs were in possession, United dropped into a back four with Luke Shaw pushing into a central midfield position.",
      "But he was not the only one to move positions. Harry Maguire found himself on the wing trying to cross into the box and at one stage Patrick Dorgu was almost in a centre-forward role as Bryan Mbeumo covered at wing-back.",
      "Fluidity is clearly what Amorim wants to see moving forward.",
      "Set-piece instructions",
      "Set-piece coach Carlos Fernandes was often on the edge of the technical area in the first half. Shortly before the break, you could see him barking instructions to United's defenders and he was clearly unhappy with one player's position as he flagged down Amorim to have a word.",
      "But Fernandes doesn't just dish out criticism. He was full of praise for De Ligt after one clearance and he will have been delighted to see the centre-back score from a corner at the death.",
      "Amorim’s Mbeumo instruction",
      "Not that he needs much encouragement but Amorim was keen to ensure that Mbeumo's levels did not drop against Spurs. He was quick to urge him to make forward runs whenever Amad had the ball.",
      "United looked at their most dangerous when they were playing direct down the flanks.",
      "Amorim warning before goal",
      "In the second half, Amorim sent a warning to his defence when they were leading 1-0 to ensure they stepped up. On this occasion it was Patrick Dorgu who had dropped too deep and he quickly moved up the pitch to ensure he was in line with his teammates.",
      "For Richarlison's late goal, Manuel Ugarte did not step up quickly enough to catch him out. When he watches the goal back Amorim will be furious.",

      "\"But before the first goal we conceded, we played a very good game. Very solid, but we still have to work on the goals we concede.",
      "\"I tried to talk to the guys and tell them to stay in the game. It was five minutes to go, we know anything can happen and I think we all have a very strong mentality now to come back and that’s what we have done. It builds confidence when we don’t lose.\"",
      "Mbeumo continued: \"It is always easier inside the pitch, outside the pitch, on the training ground so everyone is enjoying it a lot and we are going to try and build this as long as possible.",
      "\"Obviously it (United) is a lovely place to play, to develop, and I have got great teammates who are helping me and I think everybody is working really hard and it makes the job for everybody easier.\"",

      "United led for most of the match against Spurs but collapsed within minutes and were staring a first defeat for 42 days in the face until Matthijs de Ligt redeemed himself with a heroic header.",
      "Mbeumo's performance was a small triumph for Amorim, as he started on the left for the first time and performed. The 26-year-old is slowly becoming the dressing room's most important player.",
      "Amorim reverted to the striker-less front three again. Although Mason Mount was preferred in that set-up for the opening three games of the season, Amad was picked instead in the capital.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was absent due to a knock picked up in training, so Amorim named Jack Fletcher on the bench to ensure the record of including an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years continued.",
      "Fletcher was named on the bench against Tottenham in February alongside six other youngsters from the academy due to injuries, but Amorim had stronger options available this time around.",
      "Tottenham had won just four points at home this season and they were booed off after losing against Chelsea last weekend, having mustered just a single shot on target in 90 minutes.",
      "This was United's first clash with Tottenham since the Europa League final. Spurs decided to sack Ange Postecoglou after that game and Thomas Frank was hired from Brentford.",
      "Frank was hugely complimentary of Mbeumo in the build-up to the game, predicting that he will enjoy \"fantastic success\" at United. Mbeumo looked sharp as he fired a shot into the top right corner during the warm-up. Tom Heaton had no chance of saving it.",
      "\"Champions of Europe, we know what we are,\" taunted the home fans after kick-off. They jeered moments later when Senne Lammens conceded a corner from a simple back pass from De Ligt.",
      "Lammens has been supremely confident since his arrival from Royal Antwerp but didn't look switched on. The jeers from the Tottenham fans would have focused his mind.",
      "The Europa League final was not a watchable contest and Saturday's fixture was already an improvement just 10 minutes in. Tottenham looked capable when they broke forward and Mbeumo had a golden chance when he was sent through to face Guglielmo Vicario.",
      "Amorim applauded Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu for their speed to press when Tottenham received the ball. Diogo Dalot was slower off the mark last weekend and was moved to the bench.",
      "United did not make a convincing start and Amorim sent players to warm up ahead of the interval. Matheus Cunha tangled with Amad after a breakdown in communication and there was a feeling the decision to drop Benjamin Sesko was not paying off, but Mbeumo is in superb form and popped up to score again.",
      "There is no stopping Mbeumo at the moment. He was named player of the month for October and finished brilliantly to head into the top left corner after an intelligent cross from Amad.",
      "United took the lead in the 34th minute against Nottingham Forest and scored in the 32nd minute against Tottenham. Amorim summoned Bruno Fernandes to receive instructions after Casemiro's goal last weekend and Luke Shaw received instructions while United celebrated this time around.",
      "United had won just one of their past 10 away league games before facing Tottenham, a record they must improve if they want to qualify for Champions League football this season.",
      "Lammens has been crucial and the Belgium international made a tremendous save from point-blank range at the start of the second half to deny Cristian Romero. He then bettered that save just minutes later.",
      "United started awfully in the second half against Forest and Amorim was concerned to see history repeating itself. United must find a way to kill their opponents off with a second goal.",
      "Amorim reacted by introducing Sesko for Mazraoui, which meant Amad moved to right wing-back. The 23-year-old carved out a wonderful chance for Bruno Fernandes, who fired well over the bar.",
      "United could not extend their advantage and paid the price when Tottenham finally found an equaliser through Mathys Tel. Manuel Ugarte allowed Pape Matar Sarr to burst forward and De Ligt was turned by Tel. Ugarte was far too weak, and he's been a disaster signing for £42million.",
      "Mbeumo was the standout performer again. He gestured as if to say \"are you not entertained\" after opening the scoring and celebrated in the exact same manner when he fired United into the lead against Liverpool at Anfield, but he is scoring so often that he needs to vary his routine.",
      "United fans will not care whether Mbeumo celebrates nonchalantly or whether he uses the humorous 'Homer Simpson' dance. The Reds have a new hero and it's only a matter of time before he has his own chant.",
      "The club needs more signings like Mbeumo. They don't need more signings like Ugarte.",

      "Ruben Amorim confirmed Manchester United could consider strengthening their attacking options in January, depending on the severity of the injury Benjamin Sesko suffered against Tottenham.",
      "Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour and was forced off the pitch after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",
      "Amorim was asked about the striker's injury at his post-match press conference following the 2-2 draw. \"We have to check. He had something in his knee, let's see,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether it was serious, Amorim said: \"I have no idea. Because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "Sesko failed to pull the trigger twice when he was presented with two half chances against Spurs, but Amorim believes a lack of confidence wasn't to blame. He said: \"No, I think... I think that is not the biggest concern now.",
      "\"That happened in the same way that he is not scoring and then he scores two goals in the next two games [Brentford and Sunderland], so that happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with an injury because it's in the knee and I don't know. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to the Africa Cup of Nations in December, which prompted Amorim to confirm the club could be active in the January window.",

      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",

      "It remains to be seen whether United will feel the need to attack the winter market for reinforcements.",

      "£35",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport claim multiple clubs are keeping an eye on Vlahovic's situation.",
      "As it stands, he is expected to become a free agent next summer. United have been linked with the striker in previous windows while Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Tottenham are said to all be considering a move for him.",
      "McTominay has reportedly urged Napoli to complete a move for Mainoo.",
      "The Sun claims that the 28-year-old informed manager Antonio Conte to try and lure Mainoo to Serie A.",
      "\"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" a source told The Sun. \"He’s told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is.",
      "\"He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it’s on loan or a permanent deal. Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy.",
      "\"He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "Fabrizio Romano has claimed that Endrick is not being looked at by Man United.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano said: \"Rumours on Manchester United - not true. Rumours on Aston Villa – I am not aware of that.",

      "\"The opportunity to play immediately as a starter. Lyon need a striker. They would play Endrick on the 1st of January already. Come and play. It’s not, wait for a few weeks, close the deal at the end of January, let’s waste one month.",
      "\"Immediately, do the deal, play the boy. So, Endrick is very ready to go to Olympique Lyon. Now Olympique Lyon and Real Madrid are discussing the terms of this loan, but my expectation is that the exclusive story and Olympique Lyon can become a reality quite soon.",
      "\"So, deal absolutely on Olympique Lyon, and they are way ahead of the English clubs for the Brazilian striker to get him on loan.\"",

      "\"We have to check,\" Amorim said when asked about the injury. \"He had something in his knee, let's see.\"",
      "Hojlund is still on United's books, with the Denmark international on loan at Napoli in Italy. The 22-year-old has scored four goals in nine appearances for the Serie A champions. Fabrizio Romano has claimed that the loan includes an option that could become an obligation, although the parties involved in the deal view it as 'guaranteed' if they qualify for the Champions League.",
      "It means there is no recall option for United to turn to if they decide to look to bring him back to Old Trafford in January.",

      "Manchester United were linked with Watkins this summer as Ruben Amorim's side searched for a new striker. They ultimately signed Benjamin Sesko, but Watkins was seen as a potential alternative.",
      "Sesko has also struggled this season since moving to Old Trafford - in a deal worth £74million. Like Villa, United are claimed to be keeping their options open, while Villa's latest transfer plans may alert Amorim to Watkins' situation.",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Matthijs de Ligt is a leader for Manchester United despite the decision to overlook him from the leadership group.",
      "United took the lead in the 32nd minute against Tottenham through Bryan Mbeumo. Amad was responsible for the clever ball into the box and Mbeumo headed brilliantly to finish into the top left corner.",
      "Senne Lammens made two great saves when play resumed for the second half. United appeared to have weathered the storm but they suffered a late collapse after two goals from Tottenham.",
      "Manuel Ugarte and De Ligt were culpable for Mathys Tel's equaliser, however, the latter redeemed himself by scoring a heroic header to salvage a point in the sixth minute of injury time.",
      "De Ligt was not included in the leadership group that was introduced in the summer, but Amorim believes he leads by example.",
      "Amorim said of the decision: \"We choose. Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play, then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other. I think he is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well. I think he has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",
      "\"He is doing that really well because that is a smart thing for a player. But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",
      "Reflecting on United's performance, he said: \"We have a lot of problems, we are just in the beginning, sometimes the results show to people we are improving, but have a lot to do. You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes.",
      "\"Also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time. Then suffer two goals. Then losing Ben. Even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men for 10 minutes, then to overcome everything and to score is a good thing. We were comfortable in the game, but we should do better, be more aggressive, feel the environment in the stadium, the three points were there, the space was there, we felt too comfortable during the game.",
      "\"We need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood in the stadium. Today was that. We control well the game but we need to do better because the game was there to take.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he saw similarities from the Nottingham Forest game, and said: \"Today was different, we had a different energy. I felt more control from the team today than against Nottingham. If you want to compare both games. Against Nottingham the energy wasn’t there.",
      "\"Today was, we drop a little bit second half because we were comfortable in the game, was not about second place. Today was one play and then everything happened. One cross, one big opportunity, they score.\"",

      "A year ago on Saturday, Ruben Amorim was announced as the new Manchester United manager, succeeding Erik ten Hag, who left under a cloud.",
      "The United head coach wanted to take on his new role at the end of the 2024/25 season, but Ineos were insistent. It was either November or never – Amorim chose to jump on board.",
      "His first press conference at Carrington was not held until later that month. Beaming in front of the packed press conference room, Amorim set out a positive message as he looked to bring the current squad on the journey with him.",
      "\"I am a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself,\" he said back then. \"I also believe in the club, as I think we have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help. But I truly believe in the players also, I know that you guys don't believe a lot in these players, but I believe a lot and I think we have room to improve.\"",
      "Fast forward to November 2025, Amorim may not have got the perfect result, but he did get the perfect gift from one of his players in the post-match interviews. Speaking in the mixed zone to MEN Sport, Amad said something which will be music to the manager's ears.",
      "\"I think winning games always gives players confidence and now I think everyone is in a good moment as a team, we are learning every day with the manager because we believe in his system,\" Amad explained. \"But today we are really disappointed because, as a team, we didn’t win.",
      "\"Yeah, of course [we are making progress under Amorim]. At first it wasn’t easy for him and for us, but now we are trying to understand his system and we are trying to do the best every game and we want to win every game because we want to deliver with this club where they deserve to be and we are trying to do that also.\"",
      "Amad's vote of confidence for Amorim's system and way of playing will perhaps mean as much to the United boss as the backing Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave him in October. The Ivorian also believes that United are showing signs of improvement that were not there last season.",
      "\"I think now that the play is getting better and better every game,\" he added. \"When you win, you always have confidence.",
      "\"As a player, I am starting to learn this system with the manager because we are playing in a new system so we have to learn. I think we can get better every game, every day and we are training very hard and I hope we can bring this club to the next level.\"",
      "The only way that Amad and his teammates will be able to do that is by continuing to secure good results both at home and on the road. Next up is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur and the 23-year-old is under no illusions about the scale of that task.",
      "\"We will prepare the game in the week and we know Tottenham is a big team, a good team, we have to be focused until the end and try to have three points there,\" he concluded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "In Ten Hag's period at Old Trafford, United lifted the League Cup and FA Cup. Yet competing for the Premier League title proved far more difficult, ultimately contributing to the Dutchman's dismissal.",
      "Another significant challenge involved overhauling United's goalkeeping department. It quickly became apparent that David de Gea didn't align with Ten Hag's philosophy, whilst there was also a notable shortage of alternative options to provide adequate cover.",
      "In the summer of 2023, United brought in Andre Onana for £47.2million to replace De Gea. A further £4.3m was paid to sign Altay Bayindir from Fenerbahce, although both transfers have failed to work out.",
      "After a poor 2024/25 season, Onana was allowed to leave the club under Ruben Amorim last summer. The Cameroon international joined Trabzonspor on loan for the season and has earned plenty of praise.",
      "Bayindir was preferred by Amorim at the start of the current campaign and started the first six games. He failed to keep a clean sheet and conceded 11 goals before being replaced by Senne Lammens.",
      "Under Ten Hag, before Onana and Bayindir's arrival, Mvogo was targeted by Ten Hag. The Swiss international had spent several years on loan at PSV Eindhoven when he received the opportunity to move to United during the summer of 2022.",
      "Yet the 30-year-old, who currently plays in Ligue 1 with FC Lorient, has clarified why that possibility never materialised. \"Manchester United for example [wanted me],\" he told Blick.",

      "Morgan Gibbs-White levelled the scores in the 48th minute and Nicolo Savona made it 2-1 just two minutes later.",
      "Forest fans sensed their first win in the league since August, but Amad popped up with nine minutes remaining to score a stunning goal which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Amorim was asked whether United would have lost the fixture last season and responded: \"Yeah.\"",
      "He paused before adding: \"By more goals [they would have lost]. That is my feeling.\"",
      "When asked why, Amorim said: \"It's the confidence, of course, it's completely different. We came from three good games and we have a different confidence. We understand each other better.",
      "\"We talk more about this, that football is like this, and we proved it this year. We can have bad moments, but suddenly we have three good games. So football is like that. And the game is like that also.",
      "\"We had good moments, we score, you can sense we are in control of the game when the first half finished. We started the second half, we suffer, disconnect for five minutes and that's enough in the Premier League, but we managed to recover from that, which is a good feeling.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the game in further detail, Amorim said: \"We lost control of the game for five minutes and paid the price. We did some things well. Our level of energy dropped a little bit.",
      "\"And when our energy drops a little bit, you can feel it. We can play well, but it's not full power. But my feeling is that the players tried, really tried. They tried during the week and tried again today.",
      "\"In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and we suffer two goals, we didn't recover. Today is a different feeling and you can sense we could win this game, but we weren't going to lose, and that's sometimes the feeling a big team sometimes has.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to win in the end, but we drew. We dropped two points. I think last year we suffered a lot. We want to win games and overcome these moments, but now they know how to do it.",
      "\"We just need to be inside of the game until the final 10 minutes of the game. That is part of football. In the past, we could have lost everything in the positions and the way we play the game.",
      "\"I think we are improving in that aspect. Again, we did some things right, but we also have potential to play so much better, which is the goal.\"",

      "United practicing corners",
      "United practiced corners in their warm-up once again. Deliveries came from both sides before they moved into a small-sided game.",
      "United chose to focus on defending corners rather than attacking them in their warm-up, and while neither Forest goal came from a corner, both came from crosses into the box and so United's pre-match drills clearly did very little to improve their ability to defend crosses into the box.",
      "More work is needed.",

      "However, a hint to his fitness was clear when the teams emerged for their warm-ups. Noussair Mazraoui and Maguire came out between 10-15 minutes after their teammates and while the Moroccan immediately joined in with the substitutes, Maguire did some running drills alone.",
      "Unsurprisingly he was an unused substitute at the City Ground.",
      "Neville targeted by chants",
      "On a couple of occasions United fans were reminded that Gary Neville is an unpopular figure at Forest. His comments about the owner Evangelos Marinakis last season saw him banned from co-commentary of Forest's Premier League finale against Chelsea.",
      "A new season has not come with a change of heart from the home faithful and it appears from the chants aimed at Neville that the United legend is still not welcome on the River Trent.",

      "He felt he had been pushed in the face just before the break by Ryan Yates. Cunha has previously worked with Diego Simeone and perhaps some of the Atletico Madrid boss' tricks have been taken on board to the Brazilian.",
      "United frustrations avoided",
      "The United analysts were sat in the press box during the game and for the most part you would not have noticed they were there. However, when United were losing and Benjamin Sesko passed the ball out of play, a recognisable thump of a hand hitting a desk could be heard.",
      "It was unfair on Sesko who enjoyed a good game and Amad's equaliser has perhaps saved the striker's sloppiness from being highlighted.",

      "Ruben Amorim's men extended their unbeaten run after coming from behind to leave the City Ground with a point. After Casemiro put them ahead in the first-half, Forest went ahead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's strike in the 81st minute levelled the scoring.",
      "With the score still 2-1 and United pushing for a equaliser, Forest fans were left fuming when referee Darren England decided against awarding them a penalty. Ryan Yates' flick-on from a corner accidently hit Amad's arm after he mistimed his jump to head away.",
      "Despite protests from supporters and players, England opted not to point to the spot and United eventually equalised. The Premier League Match Centre account on X did not explain why the video assistant referee (VAR) decided not to intervene.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Hackett has insisted the decision was wrong, labelling the incident a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X. It was the second controversial call that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left furious with the way United's first goal occurred.",
      "The Forest boss was left angry that a corner was given in the build-up to Casemiro's opener. Savona looked to have kept the ball in play but the assistant on the far side flagged for a corner.",
      "“I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.",
      "“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that’s at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that’s a big moment.",
      "“We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I’m back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I’m talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.”",

      "Under Erik ten Hag, Bayindir struggled for any minutes at all, with Andre Onana the clear first choice.",
      "After an injury picked up by Onana during the summer, Ruben Amorim chose to trust Bayindir with the gloves. The Cameroonian's poor performance at Grimsby Town, followed by his subsequent exit to Trabzonspor, appeared to have cemented Bayindir's place in the starting XI.",
      "And yet, after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Amorim chose to give Senne Lammens his opportunity and he has not looked back. The Belgian has been impressive and the comparisons from the Stretford End to Peter Schmeichel are of course tongue in cheek but a sign of how good he has been.",
      "Bayindir is now back down the pecking order as second choice at Old Trafford and, with the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, it would be no surprise if he seeks an exit. Amorim may be reluctant to allow him to leave without a replacement lined up, but would he really stop him leaving if a decent bid was tabled?",
      "If Bayindir goes in January, it would see Tom Heaton pushed into an unexpected new role as second choice goalkeeper, should a replacement not arrive in the mid-season window.",
      "If that happens, it would be a fitting half season for Heaton, especially when he is expected to retire at the end of the campaign. The 39-year-old has had a brilliant career, and to finish up back at United as a regular in the matchday squad would be a solid achievement.",
      "If Bayindir does choose to leave, Heaton may be handed a promotion.",

He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "It’s fairly clear Arsenal will win the league this season since every other team is in transition or Chelsea but watching them time waste and then concede an equaliser in the 96th minute is hilarious. Also moaning about injuries when their anti football approach means a third of the game is just waiting for free kicks and corners to be taken.",
      "Also no team in history has been 6 points ahead after ten and failed to win the league (6 previous teams have been in that position and all won it). So if they did fail to is it fair to finally declare this Arsenal side the biggest bottlers in the history of the league? Bottled it 2 seasons ago to City, bottled even being a contender last season. Surely not 3 times in a row…?\nMinty, LFC",
      "",

      "Nevertheless, that was a proper game of football and thank goodness we have a promoted team that is shaking things up once more. Sunderland were very good value for their point and they will give any team in the league a game, especially at home. They have that combination of skill and robustness that will disrupt many a defence and attack, so good on them for adapting to the division above so well.",

      "The United winger scored his fifth Premier League goal of the season against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday and has been one of Ruben Amorim’s best players in 2025/26.",
      "Mbeumo has six goals in 12 matches for Man Utd after completing a £65million move from Brentford in the summer transfer window.",
      "After only scoring once in his first seven Premier League games, question marks were being raised about Mbeumo’s ability to perform for a big club.",
      "But he’s now bagged four in as many games and is becoming increasingly influential under Amorim.",
      "There’s one slight problem: Mbeumo will go to AFCON in mid-December and might not return until late January.",
      "The tournament kicks off on December 21, and Cameroon’s first match is against Gabon two days later.",
      "Should Mbeumo go to AFCON, he will likely miss Man Utd’s Premier League match against Aston Villa and will definitely miss games against Newcastle United (home) and Wolves (home).",
      "If Cameroon progress from a group consisting of themselves, Gabon, Ivory Coast and Mozambique, Mbeumo will also miss the trip to Leeds United.",
      "Should Cameroon reach the final, he would miss Burnley away (January 7), Manchester City at home (January 17), and the third round of the FA Cup (weekend starting January 10).",
      "So, the fewest number of games Mbeumo will miss is two, though that relies on him joining up with the Cameroon squad less than 48 hours before their first match.",
      "Non-penalty league goals since the start of last season:",
      "– Bryan Mbeumo (20)\n– Ousmane Dembele (20)\n– Raphinha (19)",
      "Not bad company to be with for Bryan Mbeumo 🤷 pic.twitter.com/Ond7PWRQsu",
      "Mbeumo will be a big miss for Man Utd, but he’s not the only one expected to be away.",
      "Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui are also likely to represent their countries at AFCON, with the former potentially being a loss on the same level as Mbeumo.",
      "Discussing those absences, former Man Utd midfielder Owen Hargreaves admitted it will be “tricky” for Amorim, but believes the squad is “good enough” to cope.",
      "He said: “I mean, that’s going to be tricky, but again, hopefully without so many games, they can keep the squad healthy and rotate players. [Benjamin] Sesko is an interesting one – they’ll need him, but we’ll have to see what happens with that injury.",
      "“I think the squad’s good enough, and without European football – I know it’s a miss for the club – but it could actually help them get back into the top four. Let’s not forget, it’s probably top five this season, and if they get back into the Champions League places, then that’s been a good season.”",
      "Mbeumo has been available every matchday and is growing increasingly influential. Amad, meanwhile, is also consistently showing his importance as Amorim’s first-choice right-wing-back, though he started in an attacking role against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "Both players are key, and Mazraoui is a solid depth option, so their absence will be felt. But if the whole project comes crashing down without them, serious questions will be asked of Amorim and his squad. Realistically, a club with such large transfer expenditure over the last three years has no excuse not to cope.",
      "In terms of replacements, you’d expect Mason Mount to start regularly if he’s fit. That’s hardly a huge downgrade, though he’s a very different player and much less of a goal threat. Joshua Zirkzee is another option and has barely featured this season, so he’ll expect more minutes during the AFCON period.",
      "As for Amad, Diogo Dalot likely fills in at right-wing-back, especially with Mazraoui away as well.",
      "TL;DR: Yes, and it’ll be bloody embarrassing if they don’t cope.",

      "Manchester United fans are losing patience with £51million midfielder Manuel Ugarte, while Casemiro’s stock continues to rise.",
      "Ugarte came off the bench in United’s 2-2 draw at Tottenham on Saturday afternoon with his side 1-0 up.",
      "Thomas Frank’s side equalised 12 minutes after the Uruguayan’s introduction, and seven minutes later, the Red Devils were 2-1 down.",
      "United did salvage a draw in the 96th minute thanks to Matthijs de Ligt, but it was another poor performance from Ugarte, who was beaten too easily by Wilson Odobert for Spurs’ equaliser and played Richarlison onside for his 91st-minute header.",
      "There’s no doubt that Casemiro is a vastly superior option to Ugarte in Ruben Amorim’s midfield, with a defensive-minded midfielder needed for the role next to Bruno Fernandes.",
      "But as Ugarte is earning £120,000 a week, cost the club £51m from Paris Saint-Germain, and Amorim is obsessed with making substitutions – whether necessary or not – he will continue to come off the bench.",
      "At this point, his involvement is hurting Manchester United, not helping them.",
      "Ugarte is meant to bring solidity to the middle of the park and help see out games. Instead, he’s literally doing the opposite, acting more like a super sub for the opposition than the Red Devils.",
      "Odobert glided past him as if he wasn’t there for Spurs’ equaliser, and Ugarte stepping up for Richarlison’s go-ahead goal was incredibly lazy, showing a lack of concentration and awareness.",
      "Don’t just take our word for it; the proof is in the pudding.",
      "In the Premier League, Manchester United haven’t won during Ugarte’s time on the pitch, and their +/- goals is -6, with a +/- points per 90 minutes of 1.89.",
      "Furthermore, United have conceded nine goals in only 285 minutes with Ugarte on the pitch, while Casemiro has been on for only five of the 18 goals conceded in 543 minutes this season.",
      "In terms of goals scored, United have netted 12 with Casemiro on the pitch and only three with Ugarte.",

      "Ugarte is more of a hindrance than a help defensively, and is obviously limited going forward, so it’s surely time for Amorim to properly trial a partnership of Kobbie Mainoo and Fernandes if he doesn’t want to keep Casemiro on for the full 90 minutes.",
      "Substituting Casemiro off seems to be a habit for Amorim. Unnecessary substitutions are becoming one of his strongest ‘attributes’.",

      "Thomas Frank and Ruben Amorim took it in turns to make bad decisions in their bid to lose a game which neither Tottenham nor Manchester United therefore deserved to win.",
      "There was a predictable spattering of boos at half-time from the Tottenham fans, who had watched another insipid attacking performance from their team on a home patch which has reaped the scant reward of 13 points from their previous 19 Premier League games.",
      "While Joao Palhinha and Pape Matar Sarr offered the very same inability to progress the ball from the base of midfield, Xavi Simons was frequently spotted looking up and seeing no-one to either bounce the ball off or find running in behind thanks to the almost comically inert and toothless trio of Brennan Johnson, Richarlison and Randal Kolo Muani playing ahead of him.",
      "The surprise in Spurs’ one decent chance wasn’t Richarlison entirely missing his header but Johnson creating that opportunity with a very fine cross, such was their shocking end product or even ability to get into a position where end products matter besides.",
      "Micky van de Ven produced a sublime tackle to deny Benjamin Sesko late in the game which ended up being worthy of the Man of the Match award as Ally McCoist scratched his head in search of alternatives, but the centre-back didn’t cover himself in glory in the first half.",
      "Understandably buoyed by his extraordinary solo goal against Copenhagen, he ignored the first inevitable and thoroughly enjoyable roar from the Tottenham fans when he jinked past a Manchester United forward with the ball at his feet from the back, but failed at the second time of asking, imagining the goal celebration when a full 70 yards from goal before being tackled after about ten of those yards as the ball got away from him.",
      "And while Sarr is undeniably the chief culprit when laying blame for the Manchester United opener, a less panicked centre-back would have taken a touch and cleared, while one with Van de Ven’s very particular set of skills could have dribbled his way out of trouble, with Bruno Fernandes admittedly close but also the only Manchester United player in his vicinity.",
      "There are also few more gear-grinding sights than the public dressing down of one player by another in a blatant bid to make sure everyone in the stadium knows who’s at fault. Sarr knows he’s made a mistake, the fans know he’s made a mistake. The only purpose the on-pitch scolding serves is to make Van de Ven look like a self-serving so-and-so.",
      "The quality of Spurs’ forwards was in stark contrast to Manchester United’s for the vast majority of this game. Amad Diallo’s delivery for Mbeumo was excellent, and while the Cameroon international scoring a header with his feet firmly rooted on the ground isn’t a great sign of Spurs’ defensive order, it was very well directed by a player who was a constant threat both with and without the ball.",

      "United looked to be cruising, albeit not entirely convincingly, towards a relatively comfortable victory until the managers rang the changes in the second half.",
      "The most ardent boos of the day came when Xavi Simons was taken off once again. But Frank may well be afforded more leeway with regard to his hooking in future as his replacement Mathys Tel scored the equaliser with a deflected shot past Senne Lammens after a quite brilliant first touch following a cross from fellow sub Destiny Udogie, who – like yet another sub, Wilson Odobert – did this alien thing of taking on and beating defenders before delivering the ball.",
      "Frank also deserves credit for leaving Richarlison on the pitch. Few would have complained at him not coming out for the second half, let alone still being around to expertly flick Odobert’s shot past Lammens with his head.",
      "But as much blame should be laid at Amorim’s door as praise bestowed upon Frank after the Manchester United boss contrived to put his team in a position where the towering Matthijs de Ligt header deep into stoppage time was required for them to claim a point when they looked destined for three for so long.",
      "Mason Mount’s touch and blind pass for Sesko before that Van de Ven tackle was stunning, and their introduction from the bench made a positive difference, but why oh why is Amorim obsessed with changing his centre-backs? Harry Maguire had been faultless and while Leny Yoro didn’t do anything wrong per se, it just creates a needless disruption when things are going smoothly.",
      "And frankly we can’t imagine just how entirely knackered, injured or concussed Casemiro would have to be to make it a good idea to bring him off for Manuel Ugarte. Tottenham had no joy in front of the United defence before that change was made in the 72nd minute, and Odobert was found in that space for both goals.",
      "Amorim got his starting XI right, Frank got it wrong, but the Tottenham manager outclassed his Manchester United counterpart from the touchline. They each did their level best to lose this game through their decisions, but instead head into the international break with a point that is serviceable if uninspiring, which also neatly serves as a perfect description of both of these teams right now.",

      "Tottenham’s last 19 Premier League games at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium comprise three wins, four draws and 12 defeats. It’s a harrowing run which would ordinarily make firm Manchester United favourites amid their promising uptick in form.",
      "But the Red Devil somehow contriving to lose not once, not twice or even thrice to Spurs last season but four times, combined with Amorim’s side winning just once away from home this term, makes this a particularly hard game to call, with their respective impossible-to-gauge quality making it near impossible.",
      "Much of the criticism aimed at Amorim in his time at Manchester United, before the improvement of late which saw him named Manager of the Month for October, has been based around his obstinacy.",
      "It’s 3-4-3 or bust and it’s typically been the latter. He’s stubbornly refused to deviate from his formation and philosophy, and while we don’t expect that to change too much against Tottenham, it could feel a tad perverse to some that – as he admitted in a pre-match interview – he’s made changes to his team with the aim of “doing something different” on the back of three wins and a draw in his last four games.",
      "“We’ve been working on it this week,” he added, and that’s a luxury he has over Thomas Frank and most of the other managers of teams vying for places towards the top of the Premier League, with no European football this season granting him the space to make tactical tweaks and work on new things midweek to make the push for qualification this season.",
      "Amorim made three changes to his starting line-up, with Harry Maguire, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu all returning in place of Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Benjamin Sesko, who drop to the bench.",

      "Perhaps the changes have been made in a bid to replicate their performance against Liverpool, where the lack of a focal point caused no end of problems for Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate, or maybe Tottenham’s insipid display vs Chelsea prompted him to pack his team full of pressers to push a panicking Spurs into ceding possession as regularly as they did against the Blues.",
      "But after Amorim naming an unchanged side against Nottingham Forest for the first time in the Premier League was a landmark call to show why Manchester United should be in the running for a return to the Champions League, so too is this newfound will to do “something different”.",
      "It points to a level of comfort, from Amorim in his players and from his players in him. Having taken a very long time to come to terms with the basics of his philosophy, they’ve now reached a stage where Amorim believes he can make adjustments to the blueprint for individual games.",

      "Amorim added: “So of course, it’s hard to hear. But my advice to Ben is you are going to get used to it, and then it’s going to be natural. It’s going to be like your Monday here.",
      "“So that is part of the process and we are going to help him, and we are going to protect Ben because he works really hard and we want to succeed. So he’s going to succeed.",
      "“When I start training with Ben, he has more potential than I was thinking. He’s going to struggle and we need to understand how he likes to play also to put in our ideas.",
      "“He is going to be our striker for the long term. But he’s going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride, and that is a normal thing in football.”",
      "Sesko, Amorim and United will be desperate to avoid him going the same way as Rasmus Hojlund, who was similarly heralded before he arrived a the club, and indeed for most of his first season at Old Trafford, as “the next big thing”.",
      "But Amorim never gave Hojlund the same “striker for the long term” vote of confidence he’s bestowed upon Sesko, whom the United boss is managing expertly, at least publicly, by insisting he will be The Man for Manchester United but agreeing with Neville over a long road yet to travel, taking the sting out of the pundit’s criticism in the process.",

      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Dimitar Berbatov has issued a warning to Gary Neville as he has urged the Manchester United legend to go easier on summer signing Benjamin Sesko.",

      "We’re enjoying the resurgence of long throws and set pieces, but football hasn’t gone back far enough. We demand strike partnerships, offside traps, orthodox wingers and crosses.",
      "Arsenal set-piecing their way to the Premier League title is boiling many people’s p*ss, while even the finest modern-day defenders appear terrified of the return of long throws.",
      "It has made us wonder what other fossilised tactics we should bring back. We’ll start with these five…",
      "We’re not having this ‘Ooh, look at that high line, isn’t Pep/Ange/Hansi so edgy…’ bollocks. Standing on the halfway line isn’t brave. Let’s see who has got the cojones to go full Arrigo Sacchi, Rinus Michels or George Graham.",
      "Admittedly, it was easier to catch opponents offside in the pre-Premier League era before interfering with play became A Thing. Back then, an attacker could time a run to perfection as their opponents were sprinting out en masse and still be flagged because his lazy pr*ck of a team-mate was stood with his thumb up his arse 40 yards away from any position of consequence.",
      "And we are not lobbying for a return of the old laws after the more recent tweaks to what’s offside and what’s not have made it increasingly difficult to trigger a linesman’s flag, especially in open play. But not impossible.",
      "When defending free kicks, which are increasingly going longer, there remains an opportunity to avoid any hassle of actual defending simply by charging out on cue.",
      "You couldn’t do it every time, but that’s what keeps it interesting. And it’s an opportunity for set-piece coaches to justify their existence with multiple attacking running lines.",
      "‘In comes the free kick from wide. City have stepped up, leaving the first wave offside… but here comes the runner from the car park, and he’s timed it to perfection.. 1-0!’",
      "We can all appreciate a perfectly-executed offside trap but, as with most things in football, revel even more in the ones that go horribly wrong.",

      "Last season, the number of crosses per team per game in the Premier League was 31 per cent lower than 2008/09. Just like the fact we import two-thirds of our cheese: That. Is. A. Disgrace.",
      "But it’s actually a little better than it was. Last season saw a slight rise in the average number of crosses per team per game in open play on the previous two seasons. Which is encouraging, but we must not rest until we have killed and burned the notion that crossing is a bad thing.",
      "What kind of joyless grump, 20 years ago, watched Beckham, Figo, Roberto Carlos – or even Stuart Ripley, Steve Guppy, Stewart Downing – get a yard and deliver, only to conclude football needed less of it, not more?",
      "Surely better that than endless ‘recycling’, passing square and back under the guise of probing to play through? One approach does not have to be exclusive to the other. Defenders are comfortable when play is predictable so, even if you prefer a penetrative pass, keep backlines – and your underused centre-forward – on their toes with the old shift-it-and-swing-it.",
      "Even if it is true that crossing is a low-percentage play, then we must do more of it to make it pay. Mikel Arteta knows. It takes 10 crosses to produce one attempt on goal, does it? How many from 100 crosses then? *taps temple*",

      "Righting this evil wrong would go some way to remedying the crossing famine…",
      "Sure, there were inverted wingers before Arjen Robben made a career out of cutting inside and finding the far corner. But the Netherlands wideman has a lot to answer for, seemingly having spawned a generation’s worth of p*ss-poor tribute acts.",
      "The game is awash with inverted wingers, all desperate to dribble across a line rather than down one. Which is fine when it works. But for the kind of success rate to make it a worthwhile, you need to be the actual Arjen Robben.",
      "Instead, we’re left with wingers so woefully predictable, it’s barely a test for any middling full-back. Tackling? Not necessary; just keep guiding them on the route up their own arse.",
      "The urge to drive towards goal is perhaps natural, but too few modern wingers recognise that a willingness and capability to go outside will inevitably create more opportunities to get by on the inside.",
      "Decide for yourself if being a winger is the easiest position to play but it’s almost certainly the simplest. In possession, get down the outside and cross; or penetrate on the inside. By suggesting you should be able to go either way, we’re really not asking for much here, lads.",

      "Crosses are counterintuitive, are they? Maybe that’s because there’s barely a soul in the box.",
      "From strike partnerships we ‘progressed’ to the lone front man. Then we lost our way completely and found ourselves at the false 9. Pep said he would play with 11 midfielders if he could, and rather than question the massive oddball, we all just assumed it was a great idea.",
      "Thankfully, the true 9s are fighting back – even Pep thought it necessary to buy the best there is – and the outlook for the more traditional centre-forwards is looking a lot brighter than it did not long ago.",
      "Still, though, it’s hard not to feel sorry for some of these lads while they plough a lone furrow, usually just ahead of their bone idle mate in the no.10, a cheating non-position for preening grifters.",
      "It’s no wonder we’re seeing too many handsome centre-backs at the top level. At least half of them have got f*** all to do other than pad their passing stats. Twenty-thousand-plus for Virgil van Dijk, you say? Stop posing and put your head on that long throw, you big, beautiful b*stard.",
      "These centre-backs have had it too good for too long. They always bring a mate, so let’s make it a fair fight and allow centre-forwards to pair up again too.",

I could be wrong, but in a similar vein to Harry Maguire’s situation, I think it’s on the club to see how the season goes, and they’ve, in a way, got a bit of advantage there. I know that both players will doubtless have suitors, particularly on free transfers, but I think you’d expect, if they wanted to stay, United have got that leverage there.",

      "And when you have devoured all those, you can create your own. The fun need never end.",
      "You’re busy, though, so with a quarter of the season now played, we’ve pored over all the tables and picked out six to tell some of the stories of 2025/26 so far…",
      "We start with the table boiling most p*ss so far this season. The one that highlights how reliant Arsenal are on set-pieces for their goals.",
      "We know that to be true because only three teams have scored fewer goals in open play. The Gunners are 15th in this table because the alphabet. They could just as feasibly be 17th, with only Forest, Leeds and Wolves below them.",

      "The opposite seems to be true, according to this table. If everyone stopped giving Arsenal the corners they are so reliant on, they might not be away over the horizon a quarter of the way into the season.",
      "Of course, Arsenal’s title charge is powered by more than just dead balls. This and this are just as important in their early-season success. David Raya has faced one shot on target in the last four games, FFS. At this point, Mikel Arteta could probably win the title playing rush goalie.",

      "Like Spurs, United are both gaining and dropping points when they really ought not to.",

      "They beat Burnley – just – but dropped points at Forest and Fulham while taking nothing from Brentford. Only Forest and Wolves have taken fewer points against sides 11th to bottom.",
      "United’s problem is probably similar to Spurs’: they are happiest when they opposition is coming on to them. When they are expected to seize the initiative, that’s when they run into trouble. So Saturday’s meeting at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium should be revealing.",

      "At the Stadium of Light, they had 71 per cent of the possession against a side playing a man light, but they were outnumbered for shots and shots on target.",
      "Having more of the ball is a common theme in Villa’s season, but so too is a lack of creativity.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results. There are only five teams left unbeaten in the Champions League, and three of those are Arsenal, Man City and Spurs.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 12th, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",

      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 62.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",

But the big three should all be fine, as should all three of their Thursday night warriors.",

      "A stunning yet inevitably unsustainable effort. Pafos have a win and two draws in the Champions League league stage having made it all the way from the second qualifying round, while Larnaca are flying high at fourth in the current Conference table.",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently around the cut line at 24th and 26th.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt's last-gasp header rescued a 2-2 draw for Manchester United at Tottenham after Richarlison thought he had scored a stoppage-time winner in a chaotic finale.",
      "United led through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header until the 84th minute when substitute Mathys Tel's impressive equaliser kick-started a late comeback for Spurs, who led through Richarlison seven minutes later only to let a second home league win of the season slip away.",
      "A knee injury to substitute Benjamin Sesko - after he wasted a glorious chance immediately following Spurs' equaliser - left United down to 10, but they somehow clawed their way back as De Ligt headed in from a corner in the sixth and final minute of stoppage time.",
      "Benjamin Sesko suffered a knee injury at Tottenham and could miss Slovenia's upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The striker will be assessed in the coming days.",
      "Spurs had never taken the lead after the regulation 90 minutes in a Premier League game and not won, while United became the first team in the competition since August 2012 to score the opening goal, go behind and not lose in successive games.",
      "Victory would have taken either side up to second in the table, but neither showed enough to be worthy of that position in a low-quality game reminiscent of last season's Europa League final. Spurs end Saturday fifth, while United are eighth.",
      "Spurs won all four meetings between the sides last season, including the Europa League final in Bilbao, and continue to be a bogey team for United, whose winless run against this opposition now extends to eight games.",
      "Although Spurs avoided defeat showing spirit to fight back, their wretched home form in the league remains a concern, having claimed just one victory from six against Burnley this season. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "Despite United extending their unbeaten league run to five games, head coach Ruben Amorim delivered a reality check after the game as he said \"we have a lot of problems\".",

      "Spurs fans booed head coach Thomas Frank's decision to remove Xavi Simons when United were leading, only for his replacement, Tel, to bring them level four minutes and 45 seconds after coming on.",
      "\"Sometimes you're lucky,\" said Frank of his substitution. \"Every single time I take a decision to sub a player, it is only with one aim: to win the game.\"",
      "It was another toothless performance from Tottenham for most of the game, as they failed to register a shot on target until the 54th minute, but Frank remained upbeat with United held to a season-low five shots.",
      "\"To play against a Man Utd team that play with confidence with Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko coming on, and we kept them down to five shots,\" he said.",
      "\"It's not that easy just to create in the Premier League, even when they had all their big boys out there. That said, our second-half response I was extremely happy with.\"",
      "\"We're playing home, of course, we all want to win and don't talk too much about home form,\" added Frank, whose side have taken five points from their six league matches at home.",
      "\"I know we need to win before we don't talk about it. But the way we turned around to stay in the game, kept doing the right thing throughout the second half, very, very happy with that. So close to winning it and on any other day, we win it.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was disappointed not to take all three points despite his team being on a five-game unbeaten run, the longest since he has taken charge.",
      "Nottingham Forest scored twice in two minutes to overturn United's advantage in the second half last Saturday before Amad Diallo's stunning volley clawed back a point late on in a 2-2 draw.",
      "It was a case of deja vu at Spurs and Amorim's response delivered a reality check for United, who once again struggled after Casemiro was taken off.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

United have made signing a new midfielder a priority in the summer, but they might need to accelerate those plans.William Bitibiri",
      "For a team with ambitions of qualifying for next season's Champions League, Tottenham's home form is simply not good enough. No ever-present side has fewer home points in the Premier League in 2025.",
      "That run has continued under Thomas Frank, whose sole league victory this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium came on the opening weekend against promoted-side Burnley.",
      "When Richarlison glanced in Wilson Odobert's cross in the first minute of stoppage-time to make it 2-1 against Man Utd, it seemed certain that fact would change.",

      "A huge 812 minutes after conceding their last goal, Dan Ballard proved it is in fact possible to beat David Raya and reminded the Premier League that the Gunners are not impenetrable.",
      "That does not mean that Mikel Arteta's side are now going to be conceding goals left, right and centre, but it does mean that at the other end they will need to be more clinical.",
      "Arteta will point to the fact that he was without several attacking options. Viktor Gyokeres joined the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus and Noni Madueke on the sidelines, but the Gunners still created 17 chances.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard may have scored, but they also wasted good chances. William Saliba may not be the one you would point at to find the net, but he too will look back on today's game thinking they could have got his name on the scoresheet.",
      "Had another clean sheet been secured, this wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things. But, ultimately, this would be costly.",
      "Saka's quality is not in doubt. Trossard's is underrated. Merino is a serviceable option as a No 9. The weight will continue to fall on them while other players regain their fitness, and their production will get called into question if more nights like this one begin to impact their title charge.Callum Bishop",

Silly free-kicks, rushed decisions in the final third. Yes, they composed themselves after the break, but Sunderland left them rattled.",

      "The last time Wolves failed to win any of their opening 11 games, in 1983, they were relegated from the top flight. It is near impossible to see how that won't happen again.",
      "Rob Edwards needs to consider very carefully whether it is worth leaving his high-flying Middlesbrough for a side that they could pass on the way up.",
      "Wolves look doomed with their best players sold in the summer and striker Jorgen Strand Larsen struggling for service and form. It won't just be a long winter, but a long season.David Richardson",
      "Even in 20 years time, Tomas Soucek will be scoring goals for West Ham in the Premier League. Probably.",
      "Watching him at West Ham always reminds me on the classic Whac-A-Mole game from the 1990s. Just when you think he has disappeared, out of sight from the first team and with too many whacks on the head to rise again, up he pops to make big contributions for the club.",
      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",
      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",

      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",

      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",
