      "Manchester United are ready to join the race to sign Elliot Anderson.",
      "Nottingham Forest midfielder Anderson has become a hot property after his stunning breakthrough into the England team. Manchester City and Chelsea have also been watching developments with the midfielder who only turns 23 next month and is seen as one of English football’s best prospects.",
      "That has also alerted United who do want to rebuild their midfield as their next priority and they have also looked at Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and also Crystal Palace’s England prospect Adam Wharton. But United are also big admirers of Anderson who only made his England debut in September but has now won four senior caps and is seen as a strong possibility to start in next year’s World Cup.",
      "Anderson was sold by Newcastle for £35million last year but it was regarded as a massive blow and something they had to do to balance the books and fall into line with Profit and Sustainability Rules. His progress since then has been eye-catching both as a defensive midfielder and a player who can make forward runs.",
      "Forest would clearly be determined to keep a prize asset and would not want to sell despite the growing interest in Anderson, who is now valued at around £75m.",
      "City have been eyeing reinforcements for their midfield as Rodri has struggled to come back to full fitness. Chelsea have also bought well when it comes to young English talent but they are well stocked in that department.",
      "United bought big in the summer with their forward line and splashed in excess of £200m on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. But a late move in the summer window for Baleba was resisted by Brighton and yet showed that United are in the market for a shake-up.",
      "They want to have a better balance in midfield and may look to get in two new players with Bruno Fernandes attracting interest while Casemiro is out of contract this summer.",
      "Anderson is under contract with Forest until June 2029 and will command a hefty fee. He is a key player for the team, having played the full match in all 10 of Forest's Premier League and Europa League matches this season.",
      "United contacted Brighton over the availability of Baleba in the summer transfer window, but the move went nowhere, with the Seagulls sticking to their transfer valuation.",
      "\"I don't think Baleba was a saga,\" Brighton owner Tony Bloom told The Argus recently. \"There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away. So we've had many bigger sagas in the past.",
      "\"But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The words Mohamed Salah and goal have become synonymous in his time at Anfield, so it's little wonder Liverpool star Curtis Jones was anticipating success from his team-mate. Perhaps celebrating early against Manchester United was just a little too overconfident.",
      "With the Reds 1-0 down on Sunday, a cross across the box avoided all bodies until it reached Salah on the right. The Egyptian superstar found himself with a moment of time in the 65th minute.",
      "After Salah's first touch, Jones was caught on camera already wheeling away with one arm raised and ready to punch the air. But the ball stuck close to Salah's feet while United goalkeeper Senne Lammens narrowed the angle available to last season's Premier League top goalscorer.",
      "Salah could only poke the ball wide at speed as he failed to score against Liverpool's rivals. The 33-year-old was eventually substituted in the 86th minute despite his side still chasing the game.",
      "Jones could only put his hands on his head in disappointment as the ball flew out for a goal kick.",
      "United earned a shock 2-1 win at Anfield, for the first time since 2016. Going into Sunday's clash, Salah had bagged 15 goals and made six assists in his previous 11 games against the Red Devils.",
      "Salah has now not scored in more than a month. The forward's form is now becoming the subject of conversation in addition to Liverpool's four defeats in a row.",
      "“I think after games like this it’s quite normal that people are focused on individual players,\" Slot said following the game. \"After four-five games, it was the players we signed, now it is Mohamed Salah.",
      "\"We have more than enough chances to win the game. Mo missed a big one, others missed big ones, and we are not used to this with Mo.”",
      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has suggested Salah is no longer one of the first names on the teamsheet for Slot. \"It’s a real headache for the coach, and we’ll see what he does. It’s interesting that he subbed him off,\" he said.",
      "\"Jurgen Klopp used to take him off quite often, which shows that, even in the past, Mo Salah could have a poor game and be replaced, even if he still had some energy and sharpness left.\"",
      "\"We’ve reached a point with Mo Salah where he shouldn’t be playing every game. It shouldn’t be a case of ‘he’s the first name on the team sheet’ anymore. He’s still part of your best XI, he plays the home matches, but maybe it’s time to think differently.\"",

      "Xabi Alonso has suggested he would be reluctant to allow Endrick to depart Real Madrid. Manchester United are among the clubs reportedly keen on securing the 19-year-old on loan when the January transfer window opens.",
      "However, they are said to face competition from Juventus, Newcastle United and West Ham United, who are all reputedly monitoring the situation. French publication L'Equipe claims Marseille are also tracking the teenager as a potential replacement for Amine Gouiri and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who will participate in the Africa Cup of Nations this winter.",
      "Endrick himself is reportedly eager for a temporary switch in pursuit of regular first-team football if his circumstances at Real Madrid remain unchanged. He has his sights set on securing a spot in Brazil's World Cup squad for next summer.",
      "Following an injury that ruled him out of the opening five fixtures across all competitions, the striker has remained an unused substitute for the previous six matches. That means he is yet to feature for the club this campaign.",
      "Alonso has now responded to enquiries regarding the prospect of Endrick departing on loan in January. Yet he appeared to suggest that he would prefer to retain him within his squad.",
      "\"Endrick on loan? We're not at that point yet,\" he told reporters at a press conference ahead of Madrid's Champions League clash against Juventus.",
      "\"The competition in attack is intense. We have to be prepared for every game. Endrick, Gonzalo, and Brahim have to be ready.",
      "\"They're going to come in, and have to be ready. This is the elite, and we need a lot of good players.\"",
      "Endrick's yearning for more time on the pitch, and his evident frustration at not receiving it, was displayed over the weekend, as reported by Spanish publication AS. The forward was said to be noticeably upset when he was an unused substitute during the 1-0 victory against Getafe on Sunday.",
      "Kylian Mbappe's goal in the 80th minute secured the 1-0 win, with Getafe eventually down to nine men. Endrick is said to have kicked a bottle in anger on the bench when both Brahim Diaz and Gonzalo Garcia came onto the pitch ahead of him in the 86th minute of the match.",
      "The forward will be hoping for his first appearance of the season when Real Madrid face off against Juventus at home in the Champions League group stage on Thursday night.",

      "Giorgi Mamardashvili has been harshly criticised for being at fault for both goals during Liverpool's 2-1 defeat to Manchester United. The Reds suffered their fourth consecutive loss against their fierce rivals at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday.",
      "This result marks the club's worst run of results since 2014, with £29m summer signing Mamardashvili making his home league debut in goal, replacing the injured Alisson Becker. Liverpool had a disastrous start to the match as Bryan Mbeumo put the away side ahead, squeezing the ball past Mamardashvili.",
      "There is certainly an argument to be made that the 25-year-old goalkeeper was beaten too easily at his near post for United's opener. He also fumbled a cross from Matheus Cunha which nearly resulted in a goal for Mason Mount.",
      "However, there was little the Georgian could have done about Harry Maguire's late winner as the defender headed a volleyed cross from Bruno Fernandes home from just six yards out. Despite this, former United keeper Ben Foster has surprisingly suggested that Alisson would've come out to claim the cross if he had been in goal.",
      "\"For the first one, I was really disappointed,\" the ex-England and Wrexham stopper said on his Fozcast podcast. \"He got dragged into that space and he's into no man's land, because you've not got much space to operate in. He can't go and affect the ball because you can tell Mbeumo's just getting it onto that right foot and he's shooting.",
      "\"What he's done, though, is he's closed that space and closed his reaction time off, so he's basically just got to hope it hits him. Whereas if he had just stayed where he was, he could have reacted to that. When you're not playing, you start to do things like that.",
      "\"I think the difference is that Allison is so set in his position. He knows where he is. He's so comfortable with his surroundings when that ball comes in [for the second goal]. When he sees that, he's thinking, 'Can I come for the cross?' A goalie at the top of his game at this moment in time just comes and punches that away.\"",
      "There is currently no definite timescale set for the return of Alisson from the hamstring injury he sustained against Galatasaray last month. Mamardashvili made his Premier League bow in Liverpool's 2-1 defeat at Chelsea, where he was left with little chance for either goal conceded by the Reds.",
      "Despite Foster's criticism of his performance against United, Mamardashvili received a vote of confidence from Liverpool boss Arne Slot earlier this month.",
      "The Dutchman said: \"We knew we were bringing in a very good goalkeeper, but when he plays his first game, that's always the best way of seeing that he's adjusted well or not. He's adjusted really well to our club, which is not a surprise because he's a quality goalkeeper.\"",
      "Mamardashvili is set to continue as Liverpool's first-choice keeper in Alisson's absence, with a demanding schedule of seven matches in 22 days ahead for the Reds. That includes Champions League fixtures at Eintracht Frankfurt and a home game against Real Madrid, plus a challenging Premier League match at Manchester City.",
      "Last month, Mamardashvili said: \"I have had to be patient. It doesn't matter if I play or not, I have to be ready. I work hard every day.\"",

      "Liverpool face a talking to from the Premier League over claims they breached the multi-ball protocol multiple times during Sunday's defeat to Manchester United. Clubs have been fined in the past for repeated breaches, but a reminder of the rules in this instance will likely be the course of action from the league.",
      "Ball assistants threw Liverpool players balls when they went out of play in the aftermath of Harry Maguire putting United 2-1 up in the 84th minute. Replacement balls are instead supposed to be on cones around the pitch, not handed back.",
      "The rule change took effect in the 2022/23 season, requiring outfield players to either retrieve the ball themselves or proceed to the nearest cone. Goalkeepers are the only exception when restarting play with a goal kick.",
      "Premier League guidance states that \"participants must not interfere with the multi-ball system, the match ball or the replacement balls at any time.\"",
      "It is said that \"any failure to follow the multi-ball protocol will be referred to the Premier League for further investigation and possible regulatory action under the Premier League rules.\"",
      "Aston Villa received a £125,000 fine in mid-August after conceding that they failed to follow protocol in five matches last season, including on several occasions when ball assistants handed the ball to their players. They were also not allowed to use the multi-ball system in their first three home league matches of this season.",
      "A statement from the Premier League read: \"Clubs are required to adopt a multi-ball system at every league match and adherence to the relevant rules and guidance is of vital importance to maintain consistency and, crucially, to ensure that home clubs do not gain a competitive advantage through their misuse of the system.\"",
      "The Daily Mail reports that there is an expectation that Liverpool will not receive a fine, adding that United are not known to have made a complaint.",
      "Liverpool and the Premier League have so far made no comment.",
      "Meanwhile, reflecting on his side's fourth straight defeat, Arne Slot said afterwards: \"If you play United, with so many quality players they have - [and] brought in a few new ones this summer - and if they come to us in a low block, playing so many long balls, then the last thing you would want is going 1-0 down.",
      "“Because that gives them even more belief. If you had told me we are 1-0 down against a United team that played in the style they did, and you had told me that we would create eight, nine, or 10 open chances, then I would have said to you that I don't think that is possible. But it was possible. So, the second thing that went wrong is that from all the chances we got, we only scored one goal.",
      "“I have said it in Holland many times and maybe I've said it here as well, it's almost impossible to win a big game of football - and Liverpool v United is a big game with so many quality players on the pitch - to win it with a negative set-piece balance. We conceded another one and that led to us losing the game.”",

      "Setting the right example, instead of the wrong one. Back in 2023 on the same Anfield pitch, Fernandes produced some shameful behaviour in a humiliating 7-0 defeat. Pundits labelled him 'embarrassing' and a 'shambles'. Which felt a little kind at the time.",
      "Because Fernandes brought shame on the famous badge of United that afternoon. He feigned injuries, remonstrated with officials during a second half which saw United concede six goals, pushed a linesman, and threw his arms up in the air from the centre circle when he realised it wasn't him being substituted. He'd asked to be taken off.",

      "The Belgian shot-stopper played a crucial role in United's 2-1 victory over Liverpool on Sunday, pulling off several key saves to thwart the home side. Lammens has been in goal for the last two matches, both of which ended in consecutive wins for Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "The former Sporting CP boss made the audacious decision to field Lammens against Sunderland just before the international break, and the 21-year-old retained his position, helping to halt United's dry spell at Anfield.",
      "Lammens has already drawn comparisons to Old Trafford legend Peter Schmeichel, a notion Amorim playfully dismissed ahead of their journey to Merseyside. However, Ferdinand has commended the keeper, asserting that he's already made a substantial impact on the defence.",
      "\"Talk about him... what I would say is, again, when I look back at when I played, when did I feel my best? When I didn't have to look behind me and worry about what the keeper might do or where he might be,\" Ferdinand shared on his podcast.",
      "\"I wasn't second-guessing anything about my goalkeeper, Edwin van der Sar is a great example, a fantastic goalkeeper, a calming influence and just so reassuring seeing that behind you.",
      "\"I think what people don't grasp, how important a goalkeeper is because he sends the vibrations through the team, his good vibrations reverberate through the team, the confidence, security, assuredness, confidence, any type of wavering from that to uncertainty and not sure what he's going to do.",
      "\"Them looks over there [behind him] means that I'm not concentrating on where I am here. If I'm doing that [looking behind] often and worrying, that looks becomes a little bit longer because the picture in front of me has changed.\"",
      "The Premier League-winning defender reckons the post-match scenes, which witnessed Lammens surrounded by his delighted team-mates, demonstrates just how much of a beneficial influence he's already had on the backline after just 180 minutes of action.",
      "Ferdinand continued: \"A lot of that was happening, the uncertainty with defenders especially mistakes being made before, it was leading to real uncertainty in the team and you see the way the lads celebrated [with Senne Lammens], it's only his second game by the way.",
      "\"It'd almost been like he'd been there a couple of years, it was like, 'this is what we do'. It was so nice to see that togetherness and the celebrations are key for me, a marker, it can be over the top and forced but there was an aggression, a 'let's go' and I hope that's what we're going to see.\"",

      "Manchester United are among a host of clubs reportedly eyeing up Real Madrid youngster Endrick. The 19-year-old has previously been hailed as 'the next Ronaldo.'",
      "Despite his promising talent, the Brazilian is struggling to secure regular playing time at the Bernabeu. Endrick signed with Los Blancos in 2022 but only joined in 2024 when he turned 18 for a hefty £52million. He has already earned several caps for his senior national team.",
      "However, breaking into Xabi Alonso's frontline this season has proven challenging for Endrick given he's up against the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior.",
      "The Sunday People reports that Endrick has told his representatives that if he doesn't start getting more game time in Madrid soon, the star dubbed the 'next Ronaldo' may be looking for a January exit.",
      "United are named in the report as a potential destination and if a deal is struck, Endrick could fit perfectly into Amorim's centre-forward position.",
      "The 19-year-old has the creativity to drop back when necessary, allowing his forward team-mates to push ahead, much like Matheus Cunha did against Liverpool.",
      "By not providing Arne Slot's centre-backs with a forward to mark closely, such as a focal point in Benjamin Sesko, United managed to stretch Liverpool's defence using Cunha's adaptable positioning.",
      "If Endrick joins the squad then Sesko could be utilised from the bench if a more direct approach is required.",
      "Cunha put on an impressive display against Liverpool and has confessed that he is flexible and prepared to play wherever he is positioned. The £62.5m signing has functioned as both a centre-forward and a No. 10. In this dream frontline, he will drop slightly deeper on the right.",
      "Amorim typically fields Bryan Mbeumo on the right, with Cunha on the left dropping deeper and allowing the other wide forward to almost play alongside a striker.",
      "However, in this scenario these positions are reversed and a more traditional winger who often drifts wide will operate on the left with Cunha positioned to the right of fellow Brazilian Endrick. Cunha has previously played in this position for Wolves.",
      "This will not only add a touch of chemistry as Cunha and Endrick have played together for their national side but it also bolsters both flanks. Currently, Amad and Mbeumo operate on the right, with either Diogo Dalot or Patrick Dorgu joining Cunha on the left.",
      "If the positions are switched we could see Cunha and Amad forming a dynamic duo on one side, which might be more effective given that Mbeumo and the Ivorian may be too similar in style. A new superstar winger could then dazzle on the left, with a more defensive wing-back providing support.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is currently one of the Premier League's hottest properties. He's already netted six goals this season and his blistering pace down the left wing has sparked transfer gossip. It's thought he could command a fee north of £75m.",
      "United have been linked with Semenyo and in this scenario, he's brought in to give United a lethal threat on the left. A front three of Endrick, Cunha and Semenyo would provide balance across the pitch.",
      "The more defensive wing-back can support Semenyo, while Amad can push forward with Cunha playing deeper. It's worth noting that dropping Mbeumo from the starting line-up after his impressive start following his £65m move from Brentford this summer seems unlikely.",
      "However, if Semenyo is available, it's a no-brainer to give one of the Premier League's top attacking talents a starting spot. Mbeumo could come off the bench like Sesko and Amorim could adjust his front three for specific matches where a wider threat on the right is needed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United have been accused of 'letting down' Harry Maguire by failing to sign a suitable partner for the central defender after the England star continued his renaissance with the winner against Liverpool at the weekend.",
      "The former Red Devils captain sparked jubilant scenes in the away end at Anfield and back in Manchester when he headed home a perfect lofted ball from Bruno Fernandes to clinch a 2-1 victory for Ruben Amorim's men, who recorded back-to-back Premier League wins under the Portuguese coach for the first time in his tenure.",
      "Maguire was a fitting hero for United given he spurned a golden opportunity to win the game at Anfield last season, but his 84th minute winner also caps a remarkable redemption arc for a player who was ridiculed after losing form during a difficult period, which also led to him being stripped of the captaincy by Erik ten Hag.",
      "The 32-year-old has shown remarkable character to bounce back and rediscover his top form - and Nicky Butt thinks that United have let him down by some of their transfer work rather than the other way round.",
      "“Do you know what you were saying about never letting the club down, I think it’s the other way around, I think the club has let him down, if I’m honest,” the former United midfielder said on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast.",
      "“If you look at his best games they have always been for England, he’s had John Stones next to him, it’s like a Yin and Yang. If you look at all the best partnerships for Man United, Bruce – Pallister, totally different players, Vidic – Ferdinand, totally different players.",
      "“With Harry, he’s going to that club and he’s never had a player next to him who can compliment him ever. Basically what Man United have tried to do over the years is try to play out for the back and they’re trying to get Harry on the ball and play out from the back like a Rio [Ferdinand] or John Stones, he just doesn’t have that in his locker.",
      "“So I think the club have let him down with the partners he’s had next to him. And now he got his reward for all the crap he’s had for the last two or three years.”",
      "Amorim himself has paid tribute to Maguire for how he has resurrected his career following some dark days under the previous regime. “A great example to every kid,” was how Amorim described the United centre-half.",
      "Maguire himself showed his class by mentioning the support United's supporters have shown him in recent years after his goal celebrations, saying: “I didn’t know where I was in the stadium when I put it in, I (just) knew I was onside.",
      "“I just fancied doing the trademark kneeslide. I should have probably gone to Bruno after the amazing assist he gave me, but when you’re in that moment, you don’t realise.",
      "“After I’d wheeled away to the other end, I felt like I needed to celebrate in front of the United fans. They’ve been amazing with me throughout my time here. (It was a) really special moment for me to give it back to them.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim could upgrade Manchester United's attack again next summer by signing Robert Lewandowski from Barcelona. The Pole's contract at the Camp Nou is set to expire at the end of this season, though the Catalan giants have an option to extend his stay for another 12 months.",
      "It's in doubt as to whether the Catalan kings will trigger said clause, however, given concerns regarding Lewandowski's age. Having turned 37 in the summer, it's reported there are doubts as to whether the striker still has the stamina to fulfil Hansi Flick's high-press tactics.",
      "Barca's system is heavily reliant on occupying the opposition half, and much of that begins with the forward line. Lewandowski has scored four goals in nine appearances so far this term, but club bosses are supposedly eyeing next summer as their chances for a clean break.",
      "But Barcelona's loss could prove to be United's gain if the Red Devils do attempt to sign Lewandowski on a free. And there's cause to believe the player would be receptive after previously giving the thumbs up to the English powerhouse.",
      "\"To Manchester United I decided and said yes,\" he told BBC Sport earlier this year. \"I wanted to join Manchester United to see Alex Ferguson.\"",
      "Lewandowski was in his pomp at Borussia Dortmund in 2012 when United first came searching for his signature. He had just enjoyed a breakthrough campaign after scoring 30 goals to help Dortmund secure their second straight Bundesliga title when Ferguson came calling.",
      "In true Fergie fashion, the Old Trafford great identified one of Europe's finest finishers and plotted his raid. However, Dortmund held firm over Lewandowski, who went on to join Bayern Munich on a free two years later.",
      "\"They [Dortmund] could not sell me,\" he added. \"Because they knew if I stayed they could earn more money, and that I could wait maybe one or two more years. But it is true that I said yes to Manchester United.\"",
      "Many fans are aware Lewandowski came close to joining Blackburn Rovers in 2010 before the Icelandic ash cloud disrupted travel around Europe. However, not as many may be in the know as to just how close he came to joining United later on.",
      "Despite his age, recruiting Lewandowski could still represent a win for United, even at his advanced age. Amorim is operating with Benjamin Sesko as his first line of attack having signed the 22-year-old from RB Leipzig in a £74million deal over the summer.",
      "Given his lack of experience, one can appreciate why working alongside someone like Lewandowski could have major appeal. United boast plenty of potential in attack but are somewhat light on seasoned stars up front.",
      "The Red Devils previously had success with Zlatan Ibrahimovic leading their line, and the Swede helped guide United to a Europa League and League Cup double in 2017. Ferguson had a habit of signing certain forwards in the advanced stages of their careers when he ruled at Old Trafford, and Amorim could perhaps do worse than to take a page from his book.",

      "Mason Greenwood became the first Marseille player to score four goals in a single game for 34 years at the weekend - only to be promptly told that he still has work to do to improve by his manager, Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Greenwood, 24, has been plying his trade in Ligue 1 for the past 15 months after leaving Manchester United permanently back in the summer of 2024. And in Marseille's thumping 6-2 league win over Le Havre at the weekend, the Red Devils academy graduate etched his name into the history books with a remarkable four-goal haul.",
      "He became the first Marseille player to score four in one game since Ballon d’Or winner Jean-Pierre Papin, who managed the exact same feat back in 1991. But De Zerbi was keen to stress that the former England international is capable of more.",
      "“It’s true that Mason can do more, De Zerbi said post-match. “He’s always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.”",
      "The former Brighton boss continued: “If he wants to become a great player, he must run off the ball. I saw [Kylian] Mbappe, I saw [Ousmane] Dembele pressing without the ball, and Greenwood has to do it too.”",
      "Greenwood has now scored 27 goals for Marseille since cutting ties with Manchester United permanently. His move to France came off the back of a season-long stint in Spain with Getafe, where Greenwood scored 10 goals and registered six assists across 36 appearances.",
      "Even though De Zerbi wants to see more from Greenwood, the versatile forward is in the midst of a purple patch for Marseille, scoring seven goals in his last 10 appearances, as well as contributing a further four assists.",
      "Marseille are currently top of Ligue 1 after winning six of their opening eight games and are the league's top scorers overall after plundering 21 goals. No player has amassed more goal contributions than Greenwood's nine (six goals, three assists) in the league to date.",

And with the iconic Copacabana beach staring back at them from across the road, the life felt perfect. Within a matter of weeks, England's assault had fallen completely flat. While in time, the sparkle from the privilege of being lured to Old Trafford, would disappear for Shaw.",

      "But not before Louis Van Gaal 'fat shamed' him, or Jose Mourinho despaired at Shaw's immature approach to being a professional footballer at the highest level. An accusation which stemmed from Shaw deciding to claim he was late to training one time because he overslept - and his mother failed to wake him up.",

      "Shaw's age means he isn't a long-term solution, but then again it doesn't matter, because Tuchel isn't in it for the long haul when it comes to managing England. The German will name his latest squad next month for two games, and Shaw should be in it. Because he can still produce the goods when he's fit and focused.",

      "Arne Slot reportedly spent considerable time working on a plan to get Liverpool back to their best during his Dubai trip. Some fans had criticised Slot for taking time away during the international break, but it's now emerged that he had not disconnected from his job.",
      "Liverpool came crashing back to earth after the international break as any hopes of ending their losing run were ended by a late Manchester United winner on Sunday. Slot's men suffered a 2-1 loss against their bitter rivals at Anfield, falling to a fourth consecutive defeat.",
      "In the final moments of the match, Harry Maguire scored a decisive goal for the Red Devils, marking their first victory at Anfield since 2016. Consequently, Liverpool were left ruing yet another late defeat - their third in a row in the Premier League.",
      "Despite splashing out £450m on eight new senior signings over the summer, including record-breaking acquisitions Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, Slot's revamped squad has yet to find its rhythm. Their ongoing poor form has seen them slip to fourth place in the Premier League standings.",
      "However, it at least wasn't all doom and gloom for Liverpool's players during the international break. Several of Slot's squad put in strong performances for their national teams before their disappointing return to club duty against Manchester United.",

      "On the contrary, the Daily Mail reports that sources close to Slot claim he spent a significant portion of his holiday plotting how to improve Liverpool's recent performance, studying clips on his laptop.",

      "In theory the move will create more competition and stop a club at the top with huge wealth spending sums that a newly promoted club could only dream of. Those in opposition of TBA say it would effectively create a salary cap with both Manchester clubs and Aston Villa voting against looking at it further last April.",
      "Now clubs who would be deemed mid-table outfits or lower are becoming concerned that the idea could be taken on lower down the pyramid. Whilst they're in the top flight they are, generally, in favour of it, because it brings them closer to the top clubs.",
      "But were any team to be relegated to the Championship they would have the benefit of parachute payments and, theoretically, be among the richest teams in the second tier. But their ability to reinvest ahead of a promotion push would be limited if their spending is limited to five times that of the lowest team.",
      "EFL chairman Rick Parry has spoken in the past about parachute payments creating huge inequality in the Championship and would certainly look at having TBA introduced if the Premier League adopted it.",
      "The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) is also opposed to the idea and has enlisted legal help to support its challenge. They have warned the Premier League it would be in \"flagrant breach\" of rules requiring it to consult. ESPN reports that the TBA proposal will be dropped before the meeting or fail to gain sufficient support in a vote.",
      "Clubs also need to decide whether they want to stick with the existing, but still divisive, profitability and sustainability rules (PSR) or replace them with the new squad cost rules (SCR).",
      "SCR would bring Premier League clubs into closer alignment with UEFA regulations and have been on trial in shadow form since the start of last season.",
      "On the European scene clubs can only spend up to 70 percent of revenue on squad-related costs. The Premier League proposal is to introduce a limit of 85 percent for those not involved in European competition. Some though argue it would bring about a stronger correlation between success and revenue.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s shock 2-1 win over Liverpool appears to have breathed fresh life into their season when all hope seemed lost. Ruben Amorim’s Red Devils fought hard against the reigning Premier League champions to clinch their first victory at Anfield since January 2016 on Sunday.",
      "Despite all of the recent talk surrounding his potential sacking, Amorim’s side got off to a flying start as Bryan Mbeumo finished clinically to open the scoring inside two minutes. Both sides went on to miss big chances before Cody Gakpo equalised from close range with just over ten minutes left to play.",
      "But it was United that dealt the final blow as Harry Maguire rose to head home Bruno Fernandes’ cross and secure all three points just minutes later. One of the standout contributors to Amorim’s first successive league triumphs was Senne Lammens, as we now take a look at two major headlines surrounding the in-form goalkeeper.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper, who arrived from Royal Antwerp at the end of the summer transfer window for £18million, has stepped up to replace the much-criticised and recently-departed Andre Onana in recent weeks. The win at Anfield marked just his second start for United, though Lammens has already benefitted from Amorim’s managerial skills.",
      "Discussing his under-fire head coach, Lammens noted Amorim’s ability to take all of the pressure off his players during times of hardship, which has helped the Belgian come into his own.",
      "Lammens said: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens was signed in the summer despite the Red Devils being linked with far more established names such as Emiliano Martinez of Aston Villa and Gianluigi Donnarumma, who ended up joining rivals Manchester City. That was due to his younger age profile and relatively meagre wages.",
      "However, Lammens had to be patient in his first month with the English giants, having been left on the bench for September’s three clashes in favour of the shaky Altay Bayindir. That patience appears to have paid off, with club legend Rio Ferdinand seeing enough from Lammens’ Liverpool performance to speak highly of the youngster.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand Presents after the game, the former defender said: \"He’s only played two games, I don’t want to get carried away, but in the two games he’s played, he’s been very dependable, and that’s the word you want with your goalkeeper.\"",
      "Ferdinand added five glowing words to describe the new United goalkeeper. \"Safe, dependable, assured, assertive, calm,\" he said \"These types of words are what you want with your goalkeeper. Long may that continue because that then instils confidence in the back line.\"",
      "Sunday’s match winner Maguire echoed that same sentiment by saying post-match: \"I must say I am heavily impressed by Senne Lammens. I don’t want to get carried away because he is playing in the position with the most pressure, it’s the most difficult position at Manchester United. But he’s got everything. Great personality.\"",

      "Fulham are set to open formal talks with manager Marco Silva over a new contract. Silva, 48, has enjoyed four successful years at Craven Cottage, while he was recently linked with Manchester United amid question marks surrounding Ruben Amorim's long-term future.",
      "The ex-Everton and Watford boss took charge of Fulham in 2021, winning promotion from the Championship in his first season as title winners. Since then, Silva has helped Fulham establish themselves as Premier League mainstays and was rewarded with a new contract in 2023.",
      "That deal, which includes a release clause in the region of £15million, expires at the end of this season. According to The Athletic, however, Fulham's ownership have told the Portuguese that they want to offer him an extension.",
      "Detailed talks over the prospective contract are yet to take place, as Fulham chiefs continue to prioritise on-field matters. But the report explains that there's goodwill on both sides.",
      "As well as being linked with United, Nottingham Forest considered an approach for Silva before then turning to out-of-work Sean Dyche, who's expected to succeed Ange Postecoglou in the City Ground hot-seat. The 48-year-old previously worked under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis as Olympiacos manager - while the two maintain a friendship.",
      "Speaking before Saturday's narrow 1-0 loss at home to leaders Arsenal - their third consecutive defeat - Silva was quizzed on his future. Fulham owner Shahid Khan was in town, having flown over from the United States to watch his NFL team, the Jacksonville Jaguars, play at Wembley.",
      "Silva replied by confirming that Khan had informed him that he's still his man to lead Fulham. \"I've met him already,\" the Cottagers boss explained. \"The main reason was not just the contract, we have many things to talk about.",
      "\"I've felt always part of this football club, from the first day until day. Like the players, it's normal they (other clubs) show interest in myself and my staff. It's a normal situation. (But) Full focus on us and working with the club on the future, too.",
      "\"I've been here five years, why not more. It (the contract situation) is not gonig to be something that disrupts our season. If I have to, I'll speak with you (about it) every single week as well.",
      "\"I think it's not necessary to speak every week about it. The right time to speak, it will arrive.\"",

      "Kobbie Mainoo was overcome with joy when Harry Maguire netted the decisive goal in Manchester United's win over Liverpool. Anfield was a cauldron of tension on Sunday, as Ruben Amorim's team took on Arne Slot's Premier League champions in the north west derby.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo put United ahead just two minutes into the match-up, slipping the ball past Giorgi Mamardashvili from close range before then celebrating wildly in front of the Kop. Despite Cody Gakpo sneaking in to equalise 78 minutes into the game, Liverpool were denied a share of the spoils.",
      "Six minutes later, England defender Maguire headed home at the far post, securing a hard-fought win for United over their fiercest rivals. The away fans naturally exploded with delight - and United's official social media account caught Amorim's animated reaction to the goal.",
      "The clip also captured Mainoo's ecstatic response, as he was lifted into the air by a member of the Reds' coaching staff, his face beaming with happiness. It occurred just moments before Mainoo was brought on as a replacement for Bruno Fernandes - as Amorim sought to preserve the advantage his team had secured.",
      "And that's precisely what United managed, withstanding a relentless Liverpool assault that continued throughout the eight minutes of additional time. Following that triumph, United rose to ninth in the Premier League standings, boasting four wins, three defeats and one draw from their first eight matches.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, endured their fourth successive loss in the encounter, having entered the clash following defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea. United now benefit from a week's respite before hosting Brighton at Old Trafford - with clashes against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham away from home scheduled before the November international break.",
      "Reflecting on the victory after the full-time whistle , Amorim said: \"Every day is special, but of course, this was a very special win. To see our fans singing during the game, in one moment, the biggest rival, they are champions on their field, in their stadium.",
      "\"This win is all about our fans and the spirit of the team - because I believe that we can play so much better. We will try to analyse the game in the same way that we analyse the other ones.",
      "\"Try to see the good things and the bad things, but for me the special thing is the togetherness that they showed during this game. That is special for me.\"",
      "Slot, however, will not have the same break that United have been afforded ahead of their next match-up. That's because Liverpool return to the fold to face Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League on Wednesday evening.",
      "When asked if the current run of poor form has had an impact on his confidence as a manager following a loss to United, the Dutchman said: \"I think as a manager you face constantly challenges. When I just started, you face the challenge of being a new manager and then you need to win games.",
      "\"Then when you do well you go to a bigger club and people are like; 'Oh, let's see how he does over there.' Then you go to be the successor of Jurgen Klopp and people say this is the biggest challenge you ever faced. Now we have lost four times in a row and that's also a challenge.",
      "\"So, the life of a football manager is an ongoing challenge. If you win games you want to keep winning, if you lose games you want to start winning again. Do we lose confidence? I can't see it yet, because every single game we've lost, we were able to create in the second half an unbelievable amount of chances.",
      "\"If you look back at all the three games we've lost in the Premier League, if you just put all the highlights [next to] each other, you would say it's hardly possible that they lose this game. So if we can keep producing what we are doing and do a few things a little bit better, then there is every reason to expect that we will start to win football games again.",
      "\"But I can't promise you that on Wednesday evening we are again able to create eight, nine or 10 open chances. I hope so - and with the players we have then it will lead in the end to us scoring more goals.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has confessed that Manchester United summer acquisition Bryan Mbeumo has 'proved him wrong' following his £71million transfer from Brentford. Mbeumo was amongst United's most significant captures ahead of the 2025/2026 campaign.",
      "Having netted 20 Premier League goals last season, the 26-year-old joined Ruben Amorim's squad following extensive negotiations. Thus far, Mbeumo has found the net twice in the Premier League for United and was amongst their goal-scorers in Sunday's 2-1 triumph over Liverpool.",
      "The striker capitalised on Amad's pass - within the opening two minutes - before defeating Giorgi Mamardashvili. Cody Gakpo levelled matters for the Premier League champions in the 78th minute before Harry Maguire struck a decisive blow to secure United's first Anfield success in almost a decade.",
      "Previously, Rooney confessed that he had harboured doubts around Mbeumo's capacity to flourish at Old Trafford. However, after emerging as one of Amorim's most threatening assets, the ex-United forward has acknowledged his initial assessment was mistaken.",
      "\"For me he [Mbuemo] has been Manchester United's stand-out players this season and he hasn't got his rewards for his hard work and the sacrifices he's made for the team,\" he said on his BBC Podcast. \"It was a great goal.",
      "\"I'll be honest I was a bit sceptical when United signed him, I don't know if he had the ability to come and play for Manchester United, but he's proved me wrong. I think he's been a great addition to the team and is by far United's best player of the season.\"",
      "Rooney also showered praise on United head coach Amorim following his successive Premier League triumphs since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November. \"It's such a huge win for the manager,\" he continued.",
      "\"I've questioned decisions, I've questioned tactics, I've questioned players' desire over this season and last season. That win is massive. To win at Anfield is not easy to do.",
      "\"The confidence that gives the players and the managers, I'll be the first to say he got it absolutely spot on. I hope we see more of it. Two points off Liverpool now... I really liked the performance and we know the players can do it, but we have to see this on a consistent level.\"",

      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",
      "A £15million fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). It was clear Casemiro was going nowhere, try as United might.",
      "The Brazilian reserved his best football for European fixtures last season, and with no European football on offer at Old Trafford this term, it seemed he would be left to run down the final year of his contract while having very little impact on the first team.",
      "Seven weeks on from the closure of the summer transfer window and the narrative has definitely changed.",
      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",

      "United have taken three points off four of last season's top six. Add the penalty shootout victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup to that list and Newcastle are the only team to finish in last season's top six that United haven't beaten during Amorim's time in charge. It is something of a quirk given the team's struggles under the Portuguese.",

Yet while the victories over the likes of Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea are great for the season highlights reel, United will never make progress if they continue to slip up against the so-called \"smaller clubs\".",

      "\"It's difficult sometimes when you only have one game a week because there's a lot of time to think,\" Mount admitted after the victory against Sunderland before the break.",
      "\"After a game like Brentford, we're hurt. As a team, as a staff, because we know we can do better. It really hurts us, obviously, as a club as well. It feels like a long time until the next game.\"",

      "Nottingham Forest come next - they have sacked two managers this season - and a trip to Tottenham follows. United could be in the Champions League places by the time the November international break begins.",

      "It's now more than 11 years since Luke Shaw's parents sat in a Brazilian hotel toasting their son becoming the most expensive teenager in world football.",
      "Shaw had completed a £30m move from Southampton to Manchester United and his parents, Paul and Joanna, had travelled to Rio de Janeiro while he competed in his first major tournament, the 2014 World Cup. The champagne corks popped over Shaw's switch, but England's campaign in Brazil was miserable, KO'd at the group stage.",
      "Shaw has been through a lot during his 11-plus years at United. Managers have come and gone.",
      "His first, Louis van Gaal, effectively 'fat shamed' him. His second, Jose Mourinho, was left bewildered by what he saw as Shaw's immature approach to being a professional footballer at one of the world's biggest clubs. The Portuguese's fury stemmed from Shaw claiming he was late for training due to oversleeping - and blaming his mother for not waking him up.",
      "There have been serious injuries, not least the horrendous double leg break in Eindhoven.",
      "That leg break almost ended his career, while there have been numerous other serious injuries. Injuries saw him start just 20 league games in a two-year period.",
      "The player himself has been through highs and bitter lows. He admits he has witnessed some 'toxic' times at the club, the shadow of the Sir Alex Ferguson era looming large over all who have come after.",
      "But somehow, amid all the madness, the mayhem, the troubled times and the gaffers who haven't lasted, Shaw has survived. And on Sunday he played a leading role in helping United inflict a crushing defeat on bitter rivals Liverpool.",
      "It was the first time since joining United he had been on the winning team at Anfield. His smile at full-time was a sight to behold as he enjoyed the raucous away end with his teammates.",
      "Ruben Amorim will have been smiling too. Shaw, fully fit and at his best, is the perfect solution for Amorim's left-sided position in his back three. It's why he's brought him back ahead of schedule a few times already, and is now pressing ahead with Shaw as his No.1 in that spot.",
      "Shaw's performance at Anfield deserves recognition. When fit and focused he can still produce the goods.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has highlighted the massive impact Senne Lammens is already having on the team. Speaking on his podcast, the United legend said: \"Talk about him...",
      "\"What I would say is, again, when I look back at when I played, when did I feel my best? When I didn't have to look behind me and worry about what the keeper might do or where he might be.\"",
      "Ferdinand added: \"You see the way the lads celebrated [with Lammens], it's only his second game by the way. It'd almost been like he'd been there a couple of years, it was like, 'this is what we do'.",

      "\"If you look at his best games they have always been for England, he’s had John Stones next to him, it’s like a Yin and Yang. If you look at all the best partnerships for Man United, Bruce – Pallister, totally different players, Vidic – Ferdinand, totally different players.",

      "But after being one of Amorim's most dangerous players, the former United striker has admitted he has been proven wrong. Speaking on his BBC podcast, Rooney said: \"For me he [Mbuemo] has been Manchester United's standout players this season and he hasn't got his rewards for his hard work and the sacrifices he's made for the team.",

      "There's a big debate. Kyle Walker or Gary Neville. Who is the best right-back in the Premier League?",
      "At 35, he's still bursting forward. At 35, Gary Neville was getting run ragged by Jerome Thomas at West Brom. So that, for me... it gives Kyle Walker the final say.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly placed interest in Italy and Al-Qadsiah striker Mateo Retegui.",

      "Man United are reportedly exploring possibilities to bring Mason Greenwood back to the club.",
      "The 23-year-old left United in 2024 for Marseille, with United having a sell-on clause. After scoring 21 goals in 34 Ligue 1 games, including four in Saturday's 6-2 win over Le Havre, the Reds are said to be keen.",
      "Fichajes have reported that United have decided to 'take an ambitious step in the market' and are preparing a bid for Greenwood. A fee of €100m has been touted, though they would receive a significant percentage should he move elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk believes has described Harry Maguire's winning goal as a sloppy one for his side to concede.",
      "He said: \"I think we conceded a very sloppy second goal. We worked so hard to get back into the game and we created great opportunities to score the winner but if you concede a second goal like that, that is the disappointing part.",
      "\"If you look at the game as a whole, we were far too rushed. I think they were very patient they didn't press us high but they didn't let us on the ball. We still created many opportunities to score but the reality is that we lost.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes believes Manchester United's first-half performance at Anfield resulted in Liverpool supporters turning on their side.",
      "The win was United's first at Anfield since 2016 and gave head coach Ruben Amorim back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since arriving last November. Bryan Mbeumo fired his side ahead after just 63 seconds before Cody Gakpo restored parity 12 minutes from time.",
      "However, United were excellent during the first-half and had numerous opportunities to double their lead. And Fernandes has claimed his side's approach to the game resulted in some Liverpool supporters turning on their side. He said:",
      "It's always good to win games. We know what this kind of games means for our club and fans and also for ourselves in the moment we are right now. It's really important because we needed three points.",

      "We knew we had to win our duels. In the first 10 to 15 minutes, we knew they would try to start the game very strong.",
      "During the first half, we knew they were under pressure when they had time on the ball. Their fans were putting themselves in a difficult position because they were booing a little for them to play a bit quicker. That's how Liverpool likes to play.",
      "Manchester United could financially benefit again from the sale of Mason Greenwood - more than a year after he left the club.",
      "The forward joined Marseille in the summer of 2024 with United receiving a fee rising to £26.6 million. As part of the deal, United added in 50% a sell-on clause.",
      "Should Greenwood move on from Marseille any time, it means that United could be due a sizeable sum of money. The player was linked with a move away in the summer transfer window with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested, but he remained with the French side.",
      "Barcelona are now the latest club said to be keeping an eye on the player. TBR Football report that scouts were in attendance to watch Greenwood in Marseille’s 6-2 win over Le Havre on Saturday.",
      "Greenwood would have impressed those watching on, scoring no fewer four of his team’s six goals. The scouting trip comes as Barcelona assess their forward options ahead of next summer.",
      "Dermot Gallagher has backed referee Michael Oliver's decision not to halt play ahead of Manchester United's opening goal against Liverpool at Anfield. The incident occurred just before Bryan Mbeumo broke the deadlock.",
      "Bruno Fernandes intercepted a lax header from Virgil van Dijk, who collided with Alexis Mac Allister while jumping to win a header. The Liverpool midfielder fell to the ground in a heap, but Michael Oliver allowed play to continue.",
      "Gallagher said:",
      "Is there a foul? No, because it's Van Dijk who comes in behind Mac Allister. Michael Oliver assesses it and says 'no foul' and play goes on very quickly.",
      "He's forced to break with and so is the assistant, so neither see Mac Allister behind them. Within five seconds, the ball is in the net. The first time they see Mac Allister down, the ball is in the net so they can go back. It's just an unfortunate incident.",
      "Harry Maguire's winning goal for Manchester United against Liverpool came a few days after Paul Scholes said he was \"not athletic enough.\" Maguire, 32, rose above the Merseysiders' backline and directed Bruno Fernandes' lofted volley back across Giorgi Mamardashvili and into the far corner.",
      "In the build-up to United's trip to Anfield, Scholes said Maguire, Luke Shaw and Casemiro are no longer physically up for the task and below Premier League level.",
      "However, Amorim clearly doesn't see it that way, with Shaw, Casemiro and Maguire all starting against Arne Slot's side. Maguire was the only one out of the trio to play the full 90 minutes, with Casemiro making way for Manuel Ugarte and Shaw coming off for Leny Yoro.",
      "Eric Cantona has been mentioned in the latest Manchester United takeover claim following fresh investment talk from the Middle East. The Glazer family recently opened the door to outside funding with Ineos chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquiring a minority stake in the club last year.",
      "Even though he only recently made an investment, takeover rumours were sparked over the international break when Saudi official Turki Al-Sheikh stated an investor was close to striking a deal for United. He was later forced to clarify that he was not the potential investor, with talkSPORT stating the belief was they are UAE-based.",
      "Their report added that some United legends had been approached over being involved in any potential bid, with some clarity on exactly that and specifically one name that was approached, being revealed.",
      "According to The Guardian, Cantona has held talks over potentially taking up an ambassadorial role that would see him back a prospective consortium in a bid for United. Other former players have also been contacted.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee showed his true colours following Manchester United's 2-1 win over Liverpool. The 24-year-old striker, who has recently been linked with a move away, was one of the first players to celebrate the victory at Anfield on Sunday evening.",
      "Despite being an unused substitute, Zirkzee squashed suggestions that he's unhappy when he darted onto the pitch at full-time. As the Netherlands international approached his teammates, Bruno Fernandes jokingly tried to put him in a headlock before bumping chests with Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "One fan wrote on X wrote: \"Love the guy. I feel bad that he's not playing more but that's the situation we're in. Hopefully we can string together a few wins/momentum and he'll be able to get more minutes. He's a joy to watch.\""

      "Manchester United will need to fork out £80million to secure the services of Antoine Semenyo, it has been claimed.",
      "The Old Trafford outfit have been the subject of reports linking them with a move for the in-form Bournemouth forward, who has already scored six goals in eight games in the Premier League this season. Liverpool are another club reportedly mulling over a deal for Semenyo, who penned a new five-year deal with the Cherries during the summer.",
      "Despite his extended contract, Bournemouth could face serious interest in the forward if he continues his impressive performances. A figure of £75m was previously floated for the Ghana winger in the last transfer window, but former United goalkeeper Ben Foster is convinced it will take more than that for his departure to be sanctioned.",
      "The ex-England and Wrexham shot-stopper also reckons Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona will be chasing Semenyo, meaning United could face stiff competition from three other clubs if they choose to pursue him. However, Foster believes it would be a battle worth fighting after describing him as \"the full package\".",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"Semenyo could go anywhere. He is a thing of beauty. The biggest thing Bournemouth did this summer was getting him signed down to a new contract. He might be worth £80m.",
      "\"This is the market and the world that we live in now. He works his socks off and delivers goals and assists. He's the full package. At 25, he's literally about to come into his prime. It wouldn't surprise me if he signed for Real or Barca.\"",
      "While Bournemouth successfully fended off interest in Semenyo during the summer, his new deal is understood to include a release clause which could pave the way for his departure in the near future. Cherries boss Andoni Iraola was understandably keen to keep a lid on the matter when questioned directly about the release fee.",
      "\"I don't know anything about the contracts of the players,\" he said when quizzed about Semenyo on Friday. \"I don't know how much they earn and don't know want to know either.",
      "\"The most important thing for me is that he continues playing well. If he does there will be more noise but it's something we take if he's playing well. My concern is to keep him in the spot where he's playing well.\"",
      "While Semenyo admitted he \"didn't feel wanted\" enough by other clubs to leave Bournemouth in the last transfer window, his personal development coach expects him to join a \"big club\" in due course.",
      "Saul Isaksson-Hurst said: \"He's unbelievable. He's a Champions League player and was unlucky not to get a move in the summer, but it's a matter of time before he goes to a big club. There was interest. He's one of the most electric players in the Premier League at the moment. So there's no ceiling.",
      "\"If you can dominate the Premier League you can dominate any league. He could play for any of the big clubs and make an impact. I said to him straight away, 'You should be playing Champions League football.' That's got to be the initial target. How's he going to do that?\"",
      "He added: \"You've got to be one of the best players at Bournemouth and help them have a really successful season and ideally be one of the highest for goals and assists in your team and in the league which will give you the platform to do that. It's a natural progression.\"",

      "They're very quick to laugh and poke fun at United, pointing out how much of a mess the club is in. Yet, the fact of the matter is, when the player in question is still contracted to United, those within Old Trafford will be just as happy as anyone.",
      "If United had tried to sell Antony in January they'd have done well to recoup £10million of the £85m they spent on the Brazilian in 2022. Half a season flourishing in La Liga and suddenly United have banked £19m with a potential £2.6m in add-ons.",
      "There's no chance United will recoup anywhere near the initial £64m they paid for Rasmus Hojlund in 2023, but if he continues to shine with Serie A champions Napoli - he's already scored half the number of league goals he managed in the entirety of last season with United - then they should at least be able to make a bigger dent in the sum that will go down as a loss on the Denmark striker.",
      "The same goes for Marcus Rashford. His United career is over and so the better he plays during his loan stint at the Camp Nou, the better the chance of United being able to demand a hefty fee for the 27-year-old.",

      "Barca boss Hansi Flick said shortly after Rashford's arrival that he believed the United loanee was capable of playing up front, despite his struggles in that position at times during his career, and a few months in he's clearly not changed his mind.",
      "\"He has given us a lot of positives and, of course, he can play as a centre forward.\"",
      "The more positions Rashford is capable of playing across the frontline, the more opportunities he will have to play and show to his temporary employers why he is worthy of a permanent move.",

      "Senne Lammens admitted Manchester United's win against Liverpool was the biggest game of his career.",
      "Lammens kept a clean sheet against Sunderland before the international break, but starting against Liverpool at Anfield was bound to ask different questions of the goalkeeper. And the 23-year-old had the answers.",
      "Lammens was not intimated by the Anfield atmosphere and played a crucial role in a special victory, making some important saves and releasing pressure with his goal kicks.",
      "\"I think it was like ten seasons ago we won here [in 2016], so you can feel it as well with the fans. This atmosphere was one of the biggest games I was looking forward to when I came here, so I'm so happy we could win today.\"",
      "Lammens was asked whether it was the biggest came of his career. \"Yeah, it has to be, I'm not even close, I think,\" he said, before explaining his approach was more or less the same as every other game.",
      "\"I think you just try to be like yourself, don't really overthink it, it's just a game, to be honest, at the end of the day. Just in my preparation, the same as usual. I concentrate on the pitch.",
      "\"Not really looking or hearing what's going on outside of the pitch, and I think with this team today, how we fought, it feels so good that we got what we deserved, I think. So it's really good today.\"",
      "Mason Mount praised Lammens for releasing pressure with his long kicks after the Sunderland win, and the approach was hugely effective against Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"We know how they press, they're gonna go man-vs-man, so I think being realistic, coming into Anfield, it's quite difficult to build up, I think, so from the beginning on with the defenders, I think I made the decision that we should get more of a long ball and do it with the second ball,\" Lammens said.",
      "\"Even though we didn't really have a target striker. But I think even though we didn't have one, the second ball we did quite good, so that's how we could still push them away, and how we also scored the first one, I think, it was because of the long ball, second ball and then a counter.\"",
      "When asked if that was his own decision, he said: \"No, it's also the team, the coach, they try to give you as much information as they can, but yeah, you have to be realistic as well, especially in the beginning of the game, if it really works like this, then you should just stay with this tactic, and I think today it worked out.\"",
      "Lammens continued: \"Like I said, it was ten seasons ago since we win in here, so that's kind of special, and also, I don't know for sure, but two [league wins] in a row is also something we've been looking forward to, to get the momentum going.",
      "\"I think that was a big part of what the coach showed us this season, get the momentum going, and there's been quite some disappointments this season, some games that we wanted to take momentum but we couldn't, and I think today could be a start of a good momentum, and we should next week at home as well (against Brighton), so with the fans behind us we should try to win that game as well.\"",
      "United showed immense character to score a winner after an equaliser from Cody Gakpo. \"Yeah, I've not been here a long time, but you can feel it. With the team, we've all got players who are really experienced, and we know that even if they score we've still got a chance,\" he said.",
      "\"I think last year as well and this season we scored some goals after the opponent scored, so we knew with the crosses on Harry [Maguire] and stuff, he scored quite a lot of them.",
      "\"So you never want a game like this, but especially defending in the last 20 minutes, defending the box and how we throw ourselves in front of the ball, also the players who came in, it's not difficult in this environment, and the type of game it was, so I'm really proud of the team today.\"",
      "Asked about shutting out the noise, he responded: \"Yeah, I try my hardest, I think I'm quite OK at this, trying to keep the noise out from outside, like I said, just prepare the same way as I've always done, treat it like any other game, of course you have to be realistic, it's not like any other game.",
      "\"But you still try to prepare like this, and I think just from the first minute on you be realistic, and like I said with the game plan we did as well, I think we executed it quite good, so we knew before the game it was going to be really difficult, and we had to defend with 11 people, and we did, so it was really good.\"",
      "Discussing Ruben Amorim, Lammens said: \"For me, he's always the same, I haven't been here as long as I said before, so maybe it's different for other guys, but for me as a coach he gets a lot of pressure.",
      "\"You can feel it from the outside, you can read it, you can hear it, but I think he does his best, and he does really good, try to keep the pressure on him and not on the team, he takes a lot of the pressure from us, and that's also what the great managers do.\"",
      "Lammens' life has changed dramatically since moving to Old Trafford. \"Of course from the outside I try to keep my best friends close, my family and the rest is a little bit like outside noise, now I'm doing good. So it's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it goes not so good it will be all bad commentary,\" he said.",
      "\"I think my social media has exploded, but they told me before the transfer, I already knew it a little bit, but it's just a really good feeling that you get the praise, also with the wins, it's a really nice feeling.",
      "\"It's [Manchester] really nice, I've been in my apartment now a couple of weeks, so it's quite easy.\"",
      "Will Lammens celebrate the victory? \"I think I'm going to go quite easy tonight,\" he smiled. \"One of my best mates is here, so I'm going to spend the evening with him a little bit, enjoy this.",
      "\"But I think we've tasted it and now we want more, that's the most important, so this is not the end station, so now we just have to keep going.\"",

      "Mason Mount",
      "Always works hard for his teammates. Mount worked tirelessly again and received warm applause when he was substituted in the 61st minute. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Saw the game out well after replacing Casemiro. 7",

      "Should Greenwood move on from Marseille any time, it means that United could be due a sizeable sum of money. The player was linked with a move away in the summer transfer window with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested, but he remained with the French side.",
      "Barcelona are now the latest club said to be keeping an eye on the player. TBR Football report that scouts were in attendance to watch Greenwood in Marseille’s 6-2 win over Le Havre on Saturday.",
      "Greenwood would have impressed those watching on, scoring no fewer four of his team’s six goals. The scouting trip comes as Barcelona assess their forward options ahead of next summer.",
      "The Spanish club have Marcus Rashford on loan from United, and could well take up the option to make that deal permanent. Should that happen, and Barcelona make a move for Greenwood, then a United reunion could be on the cards at the Nou Camp with the two players previously playing together at Old Trafford.",
      "United will keep a close eye on both situations closely over the next few months. If Barcelona trigger the option to buy in Rashford’s loan deal, that will see them earn £25 million, plus £5 million in add-ons, with the club also having a sell-on clause to again possibly benefit them in the future.",

      "It was reported previously that he was considered as David Moyes's successor after the club approached him in 2014, before Klopp decided to remain in the Bundesliga. Speaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast, Klopp revealed that he had reservations following a chat with the United hierarchy.",

      "\"Not at all [about the football] then I sat there like it wasn't for me. Then the pure football project comes up and a sensational talk to Mike Gordon [Fenway Sports Group president] that's really important as well.",
      "\"He's the owner but John [Henry] and Tom [Werner], after the talk I wanted to be Mike's friend, he was such a nice guy. After that, it was pretty special.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Explaining why he feels it has gone wrong at Old Trafford, the 58-year-old added: \"I haven't thought for a second since joining Liverpool what United did right or wrong.",
      "\"I went to Liverpool and in that moment you became our opponent, not my enemy, but an important opponent, one that is much more fun to beat.",
      "\"Always in football, like in life, you only find a solution now knowing you have two day later another problem. There's no long term, 'we have to deal with that for another two day then we can sort it'.",
      "\"We would have to deal with it for a year or two then we can make a big step, in a football case, contracts are running out, player goes anyway, sell him but because you're in such a rush all the time just because you have to win the next game.",
      "\"For United, in the years when they were not happy they would buy the time, Jose coming second, no one was happy. Remember that? In that time second was not good enough and now you're not even close to that but that's not a Man United story, it's a football story.",
      "\"You win, you're the greatest, you lose, you know nothing about the game, you draw, you're boring, it's only your idea and where you want to go. Everything in life is about development, you are not the same as you were 10 years ago, it means the time between then and now counts.",
      "\"I have to plan my own life, medium and long-term, and the future of a football club. A footballer can score five goals but will not sort the problem. I don't know the United problems but Liverpool was the same, on the day we sold Phil Coutinho, that's not the day I thought, 'oh, good we have the money' I lost a player I wanted to work with for the next 10 years.",
      "\"We invested it smartly that's true but it's not we found the position and sorted it, we had to sort something differently, we found two players in Alisson and [Virgil] Van Dijk, that was for the future to go from there and that's the difference I think.\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has revealed that Manchester United knew to target Liverpool full-backs Milos Kerkez and Conor Bradley in their 2-1 victory at Anfield on Sunday.",
      "The Reds started well thanks to Amad's through ball down the right flank finding Bryan Mbeumo to lash home the opener. Cody Gakpo, who hit the woodwork three times during the match, equalised with 12 minutes remaining to seemingly turn the tide back in the host's favour.",
      "However, Harry Maguire's late header restored United's advantage to secure a crucial win. After the game, De Ligt spoke to ViaPlay about two key areas the Reds were looking to exploit at Anfield.",
      "\"We knew that Liverpool had weaknesses, and that's their full-backs,\" he explained. \"We were all really hyped, and the focus was very high. Today was a game that you really have to be concentrated.\"",
      "United's game plan to focus on the full-backs worked with Bradley forced off on the hour mark as Arne Slot's team chased the match. Kerkez stayed on for the entirety of the encounter but was caught cold for Mbeumo's goal.",

      "\"Scousers rule the country, like we've always done before,\" read the banner unfurled in the Kop before the game. Bryan Mbeumo was celebrating in front of Liverpool's famous stand just a few minutes later. Mbeumo gestured with his arms, as if to say, 'Are you not entertained?'.",
      "Ruben Amorim had not won back-to-back league games before visiting Anfield on Sunday, but Manchester United won against Liverpool to get that monkey off Amorim's back in remarkable fashion.",
      "Amorim has been under immense pressure this season, yet he became the first United manager since Louis van Gaal in January 2016 to oversee a victory away at Anfield. The win could be a tenure-defining result.",
      "United's head coach made the decision to name Benjamin Sesko on the bench and revert to the striker-less front three he selected for the opening three games of the Premier League season.",
      "Sesko had scored twice in his last two matches. The 6ft 5in striker was the focal point against Sunderland, which was key to the direct approach, but Amorim preferred a more industrious front line at Anfield.",
      "The concerns that United could be toothless were made to look stupid almost immediately after kick-off. Amorim needed to get his team selection right to give United a chance of winning against Liverpool, and another big decision was starting Amad at right wing-back, despite his defensive vulnerabilities.",
      "Amad looked capable of making something happen every time he touched the ball. His pass to assist Mbeumo was perfectly weighted and a shaky Milos Kerkez could not deal with his runs forward.",
      "Liverpool chiefs will be wondering if they can find the receipt for Kerkez. Amad made him look silly and the away section roared whenever he was picked out by a teammate.",
      "Lammens was booed by the Anfield Road Stand when he emerged to warm up. The 23-year-old was excellent against Sunderland, but starting at a raucous Anfield represented the biggest challenge of his career.",
      "The Belgian sent his goal kicks long each time, despite the lack of a focal point, which helped to release the pressure. There was a sense of expectation from the terraces when Alexander Isak was played through into the box in the first half, but Lammens was equal to the effort and saved with his feet.",
      "Casemiro played 90 minutes twice for Brazil during the international break and started at Anfield. His experience was invaluable and he was jeered when he prevented Liverpool from taking a quick free-kick.",
      "Fernandes sent a shot into the Kop after another intelligent pass from Amad and put his hands on his head, understanding that the opportunity he had missed could have consequences. It didn't.",
      "\"We'll still win - a last-minute winner,\" said a Liverpool steward in the media room during the interval. There was a sense that Liverpool had been fortunate in securing late wins against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Burnley, but their luck ran out during defeats to Crystal Palace, Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "Cody Gakpo struck the woodwork at different ends of the ground. You need quality and a touch of fortune to leave Anfield with a victory, and there were signs that hinted United could seal three points on the red side of Merseyside for the first time in nine years, including when Mohamed Salah missed from close range.",
      "Casemiro was serenaded by United's fans when he picked up a card for a professional foul. Amorim replaced Casemiro with Manuel Ugarte and the 33-year-old was congratulated by staff as he left the pitch.",
      "United rode their luck at times and Liverpool showed the type of determination that saw them crowned champions by equalising, finally finding a late breakthrough.",
      "But there was one final twist. There will be chants created about Harry Maguire's winner at Anfield. Maguire slid on his knees and United staff mobbed each other on the touchline.",
      "Liverpool considered hiring Amorim as Jurgen Klopp’s successor but were said to hold reservations over his fixation with his formation. Slot won the league title in his first season and Amorim oversaw a 15th-placed finish at United.",
      "Amorim admitted his side could not build momentum after the Sunderland victory. It was bound to be a challenge to win back-to-back league games for the first time against Liverpool - but United did it.",
      "Liverpool have form for getting United managers the sack. Erik ten Hag was backed to succeed by United chiefs before losing 3-0 to Liverpool at Old Trafford - and he was axed just 57 days later.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was finally put out of his misery 28 days after losing 5-0 to Liverpool at Old Trafford, while Jose Mourinho was sacked just two days after losing to Liverpool.",
      "Amorim has insisted that United have improved this season, but there has been a lack of evidence to back up his argument until now. Amorim will not be the next United boss to be sacked after Liverpool.",
      "The 40-year-old might turn the Reds around after all.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",

      "Amorim secured the biggest win of his tenure at Old Trafford against Liverpool, with Harry Maguire scoring a late match-winner after an equaliser from Cody Gakpo.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring within just two minutes at Anfield. Liverpool fought back and struck the post three times as they tried to respond, eventually drawing level in the 78th minute of the game.",
      "But United had the last laugh as Maguire headed home in the 84th minute to secure a special victory for United.",
      "Speaking after the game, Amorim said: \"I think we started really well, we had a great spirit, we didn’t play well with the ball, we created chances, we suffered some chances also, we lost a bit of composure in the second half.",
      "\"We managed it well when we lost the ball. It was a great win, not a very well played game from our part, but a great spirit and that is the only thing I can ask.\"",
      "Speaking about winning back-to-back league games for the first time, Amorim said: \"Of course it is really important. I don’t have many wins in Manchester. It is really important back-to-back, every detail of this game, the spirit when we suffer a bad moment or control, all the small things were perfect.",
      "\"Let’s try to do that next week. It is really important for our fans, they struggle against Grimsby and Brentford and today they saw a different team\"",
      "Amorim made two changes after winning against Sunderland, including the recall of Maguire. \"Especially in the bad moments, you have to go with your gut,\" he said about his selection.",
      "\"That is the most important thing for a manager and then sometimes you have a player in a bad moment and understand it is not for him and take him out for a game.",
      "\"Sometimes the characteristics of the game change the way we approach it. [Matheus] Cunha in the middle, if we put Ben [Sesko], it is easier for this kind of centre-backs to control our striker. This kind of game when we win, the coach is so smart and when we lose the problem is the manager.\"",
      "United are now just two points behind Liverpool in the table. \"I want you guys to continue with the narrative that you are so I will not increase the goal,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"What we need to do is try to win three games in a row and then forget about top four, top six, we already said we want to go to Europe. This doesn’t change anything, we are the same team we were 90 minutes ago.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether United are now through the \"storm\" and said: \"I have no idea. If we show the spirit we show every day I think we are going to win so many games, but for that we need to show action.\"",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with more than £60 off select items.",

      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire insists the win over Liverpool is \"definitely not\" just three points as United beat their old rivals at Anfield for the first time since 2016.",
      "The Reds got off to the best possible start at Anfield as Amad's through ball caught Liverpool sleeping and Bryan Mbeumo fired past Giorgi Mamardashvili. The hosts searched for an equaliser but were left frustrated as Cody Gakpo hit the post three times.",
      "Gakpo's luck eventually changed in the second half. He was on hand in the centre to tap home from close range and leave Senne Lammens with no chance to make it 1-1.",
      "Entering the final ten minutes, the momentum appeared to be with the hosts but Anfield was silenced late on. After a corner was recycled, Bruno Fernandes clipped a cross to the back stick where Maguire was lurking to rise highest and send the away end wild.",
      "\"It has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points. It is the old cliché that it is only three points but it is definitely not, it means a lot more than that to the boys, the club, the fans.",
      "\"I have been here for seven years now and coming to this ground every time and not get three points has been tough. It is for the fans and I hope they have a great night tonight because of course it is only three points on the table, but to come here and get it over Liverpool, as they have been a top team over the years and they have been a lot better than us in recent years so it is good to get one over them.",
      "\"Football is all about memories and creating special memories and I am sure all the fans will have a memory that they will never forget. We will all go home happy.",
      "\"We won’t get carried away because we know this club is not in a position to get carried away. We need to use this as motivation to reach levels that they have reached in recent years because that is where this club should be at.\"",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to reports, England international Kobbie Mainoo is ‘very close’ to leaving Manchester United as they have set ‘favourable conditions’ for a deal.",
      "Mainoo has been heavily linked with a potential exit from Man Utd over the past year as he has slipped in the pecking order at his boyhood club.",
      "The centre-midfielder enjoyed a brilliant breakout season in 2023/24 as he shone for Man Utd and England, but he suffered a major fall from grace in the following season due to a loss of form and his injury issues.",
      "The 20-year-old has also been negatively impacted by the appointment of head coach Ruben Amorim, who has favoured other players as his game time has been limited.",
      "In January 2025, it was reported that Man Utd were open to the pure profit sale of Mainoo, but he did not secure a move in the winter or this summer.",
      "READ: Actually, winners Manchester United had a better summer transfer window than losers Liverpool",
      "In the summer window, Mainoo submitted a request to leave on loan, but this was denied as Man Utd felt that they did not have appropriate cover.",
      "However, Mainoo’s situation has not changed in recent months and it is not out of the question that he leaves Man Utd in January.",
      "Serie A giants Napoli were among the clubs interested in Mainoo in the summer and a new report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims he is already ‘very close to finalising’ a move to the Italian side.",
      "According to the report, Man Utd are more willing to let him leave in the winter than in the summer, with the Premier League giants setting ‘favourable conditions’ for a transfer.",
      "The report claims the Red Devils are only willing to let him leave on loan ‘without a buy option’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The terms of the deal will be crucial: United are demanding that the loan not include a buyout clause; Napoli, meanwhile, needs space in midfield to include him.",

      "United came into their Premier League match against Liverpool having won their previous match – 2-0 win over Sunderland. But that Ruben Amorim had never led the Red Devils to back-to-back Premier League wins suggested that a match against the champions was unlikely to change that.",
      "However, United went ahead in the second minute of the game and though Cody Gakpo equalised for Liverpool in the 78th minute, honours were only even for six minutes, before Harry Maguire secured the win for United with a header into the corner of the net.",
      "Red Devils legend Neville has revealed he and many others had little faith of the club pulling off a win, but they were immediately proven wrong.",
      "He said on the Gary Neville Podcast: “And not just me, but when I saw the team, I thought, we’ve got no chance.",
      "“And I had three or four texts from United fans saying, oh my God, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] in midfield, [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt at the back.",

      "“I have to say, within a minute, that had gone because it was a brilliant moment for United, a really good bit of play from Amad [Diallo], slipping it into [Bryan] Mbeumo. And that just got them off on the right footing.”",
      "A look at the stats of the game suggests there was indeed reason for Neville and others to be cautious.",
      "Liverpool had more shots, more on target and much more of the ball. However, United sat back and played the ball long to get themselves out of trouble and transition from defence to attack.",
      "As a result, the Reds struggled to break them down and though they should have scored a second when Gakpo glanced a free header wide of an essentially open net, never managed to find the net again.",
      "Two wins on the spin will give United confidence that they can beat the teams on a lower rung than Liverpool, with Brighton and Nottingham Forest their next two opponents.",

      "Roy Keane has named a manager who would “create havoc” as his preferred option replace under-fire Ruben Amorim at Man Utd.",

      "Bournemouth: Andoni Iraola – 2026\nGary O’Neil was axed and Iraola brought in with a more progressive style of football after his contract with Rayo Vallecano expired. He was handed a two-year contract, which seems sensible. Then he signed a contract extension at the end of his first season, which also seems sensible. Bournemouth are understandably keen to persuade the Spaniard to sign on again but Iraola is ambitious and many big European clubs will be circling.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Keith Andrews – 2028\nPerhaps mindful of making too many changes in the same summer Thomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard left, Brentford decided to appoint from within when giving set-piece coach Andrews his first chance sitting in the big chair.",

      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Oliver Glasner – 2026\nThis felt like something of a coup for Palace, who appointed Glasner to replace Roy Hodgson. They have since – very wisely – opened contract talks with the man who delivered their first trophy. There have been some “early conversations” about a new deal but there’s little doubt that the Austrian will have options.",

      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has ‘said yes’ to a £50m transfer as they look to sign one of five targets in January.",
      "The Red Devils have been very active in the transfer market in recent months. In the summer, they spent around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "These signings filled the void left by the departures of Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony.",

      "United were priced out of a move for Baleba in the summer as Brighton wanted more than £100m for their prized asset. Despite this, he remains an option heading into the January transfer window, while Crystal Palace standout Adam Wharton is another candidate.",

      "“He sets a standard every time he’s on the pitch, and I know he has his limitations, but who doesn’t?",

      "“If they weren’t already convinced of how important he is, they will be after that display against Liverpool.",
      "“Plus, it’s the stuff he does behind the scenes as well, they’ve got a lot of younger players at the club, especially in defence, and he’s an excellent influence and example for them.",

      "Never in my wildest dreams did I think that every negative inkling of Liverpool I had over the summer would be on display so plainly for 90 minutes, or that they’d be in such a chaotic state of flux midway through October. I’m obviously delighted that United took advantage and got a win, but I don’t actually think they had to put on a storming display to manage that. It was a 7/10 from United – some good, some not so good. A more confident/capable team probably goes for the throat at 1-0 up and goes in at half-time 2 or 3 goals to the good.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "That said, it was nice to see a game plan in place from Amorim and a disciplined performance from the United players. Mbeumo, Cunha and Lammens have been immediate upgrades on the dross they’ve replaced, and the performances across the board do feel slightly boosted from last season (not hard, but still). There’s a bit of spirit in the team – Sesko seemed genuinely delighted with the winner and the result, instead of sulking like the Rashfords and Sanchos of this world when he was benched. Those small differences can add up over time, and it’s much easier to get behind a team that looks to have a healthy quota of good eggs (special mention to De Ligt in that sense).",
      "But going back to the aforementioned negative inklings re: Liverpool, I thought the following were pretty indisputable:",
      "All the above borne in mind, I’d be starting to look at Slot too. He obviously has tonnes of credit in the bank, but that summer splurge looks misdirected at this stage and his excuses after the game were limp. Moaning about low blocks and long passes out to bypass the press is facile – you have to expect those things when you’re champions and playing at home. Not having any solution bar “chuck all the attackers on and pile forward” debunks a lot of the praise he got for his tactical flexibility last season. They did have chances to score more, but so did United. If you turn football into basketball, you’re playing with fire.",
      "Finally, it’s heartening to see the narrative for this season having flipped so dramatically in a month. From “mark of champions, league is done” when the issues were already clear and Liverpool were getting away with it, all the way to “deepening crisis, huge opening for Arsenal/City” in the space of 4 weeks that even included an international break. The truth is somewhere in the middle obviously, but seeing the usual early season knee-jerks being swiftly corrected is nice. Hopefully the remainder of the season provides as much intrigue.\nKeith Reilly",

      "And I haven’t even started from Wirtz or Frimpong yet.",
      "There is no plan, no tactics, midfield is invisible and a big mess.",

      "Bring it on!",

      "",
      "…Can those defending Slot not admit Liverpool are still 4th despite him, not because of him? The majority of wins were the result of individual brilliance, and nothing to do with his tactics or game plan. One half of decent football from 10 games is damning. The man has persisted with Salah, Mac Allister and Virgil/Konate (delete as applicable) when they’ve repeatedly stunk the place out, and made Szoboszlai at RB a thing, when you have two actual defenders in Gomez and Frimpong sat on the bench.",
      "He also lacks ‘de bolls’ to drop Salah and play both Ekitike and Isak. I don’t subscribe to the view that Liverpool spent £400m to bolster their squad, as they’ve a net loss on players after the transfer window. However, £200m was spent on two strikers who were supposed to be an improvement on what was already there. Yet here we are, with Salah being completely anonymous for 90 minutes yet again, and Gakpo missing more than he scores.",
      "Finally, post-game interviews have become a cringe-fest. Bemoaning the other teams’ tactics (case in point yesterday “they only played long balls”) after yet another poor performance is an embarrassment. Last season’s easy-going and honest (Dutch?) vibe has been replaced with snide and derogatory remarks about opponents, win, lose or draw. There’s obviously massive pressure on Slot, but a bit of self-awareness is needed.\nDF",

Players need to settle and get to know each other and fully understand what the manager wants. The team has changed a lot since the last year. They lost 3 big players in the team and bought in a whole load of new ones. And that’s not including even the tragic way one of those players left.",
      "Three games ago Liverpool were 5 points clear and the chatter was they were slam dunk to win the league. 4 games ago Amorim was an idiot whose formation would never work. Since then Liverpool lost 4 games in a row and United won 3 out of 4.",

Grav was super and bombed forward to great effect, but given the way we are currently set up we absolutely need someone sitting in that position in front of the back 4, and he’s the best person to do it. Having our 6 charging forward to join attacks is all well and good, but it’s leaving us far too open.",
      "Other aspects would be as mentioned previously here – let the fullbacks bomb forward, play a front two narrower with Wirtz behind.",
      "Ultimately, the results haven’t been great, but our last 3 games we’ve created 6.5 xG and scored 2 goals, while conceding 3.6xGA and 4 goals. We aren’t taking the chances we are conceding and, no matter what tactics you have, if you’re doing that you can’t expect many good things to happen.\nTom, London",

      "Bit surprised to see that this hasn’t been mentioned in any of the coverage anywhere following Liverpool’s abject humiliation at home by United yesterday, especially what with F365 being the sainted protectors of footballers’ and fans’ mental health, provided they don’t have different views on certain matters of course. The collective expectations of Liverpool this season have been massively overblown, the steep decline we are seeing was always far more likely – it’s the logical outcome of human beings being forced to work in a high pressure environment during a mental health crisis.",
      "I watched the Chelsea game back before the United one, and was struck not just by how every single Pool player was making basic mistakes that are normally coached out of players at school, but that the reaction to each and every snafu was the same vacant lost expression and resignation that nothing better could be expected. There didn’t seem to be any fight, nor fire in the belly to do themselves justice. It was the same yesterday – when Mo’s toe-punting it six feet past the upright and Gakpo’s heading it even further wide, both in the six yard box, the reactions were more performative than passionate. Mo normally smiles, knowing a goal is coming soon, especially against United – this time, a look to the heavens, almost close to tears.",
      "Slot’s completely lost his composure too – the analysis is spot on – he went full cuptard when there was plenty of the game to go. Previously, we would go a goal down and the reaction would be to step up the focus and intensity and eventually overpower and owerwhelm pretty much every opponent we faced. Now we shit the bed at the first sign of adversity, throw everybody forward and start finger-pointing and arm-waving that it is everybody’s fault but our own. No accountability, no sacrifice, no collective, no team. Slot’s deployment of the new signings has neutered them completely, while simultaneously making the established players demonstrably worse. Slot’s not waving, but drowning unfortunately.",
      "But these are elite players, some of the best in the world – winners of the biggest trophies. Slot is a proven winning coach – calm, authoritative, an excellent, effective decision maker. So what’s gone wrong?",
      "It’s got to be Jota. Football is a team game, the best teams win trophies, to get the best teams you need closeness and intimacy (fnarr) – absolute trust in the people you are in the trenches with, you have to do anything for the person next to you for mutual success – it should come as naturally as breathing. It’s more of a band of brothers than colleagues – everybody intensely focussed on the same goals, and the collective euphoria that follows achieving them. United looked like more of a team yesterday – more focussed, more together. Liverpool looked like they didn’t really want to be there, engulfed by triggers of tragic loss.",
      "Liverpool are reminded constantly of Jota’s passing – the space in the dressing room, the chant every 20 minutes of every game. Liverpool’s non-cunt (before this summer anyway) recruitment policy has resulted in a squad especially vulnerable to this situation. They are being forced out into the spotlight multiple times a week while they are still trying to process the loss of a friend, almost brother. The new players are trying to forge relationships with damaged human beings – it’s not easy. Losing a friend too soon (RIP Joycey, sorry you missed Spurs actually winning something) stays with you always – initially you are thinking about them, about what happened, constantly. Over time you think about them less, but it’s always there, like a cold blanket enveloping you or a dark undercurrent trying to pull you down. Imagine taking that with you onto the pitch under the bright lights and intense scrutiny, everybody expecting, no demanding you deliver, and abusing you when you just can’t.",
      "This isn’t an excuse, nor a plea for sympathy, but it does explain why the formerly faultless have reached a new nadir – why players can’t play a pass or shoot straight, why Slot can’t select the right players or make the right subs or pick the right tactics – they are all in a PTSD storm with no way out until the summer.",
      "So Liverpool won’t win anything this season, they were never going to – this season is all about repairing mental health, rebuilding confidence and trying to find some affinity with each other. It’s a real shame that Slot and the Big Virg won’t admit this publicly, as that would start the healing process, but I guess it must be impossible to do that in the macho football microcosm.\nGofezo (or maybe it is just because Slot looks exactly like a human glans)",

      "So Spurs lost on Sunday, to Aston Villa. For the third time in three games in 2025 as it happens, and for the sixth time in 8 games since Steven Gerrard left. A period where Thomas Frank has now lost 5 times and drawn twice in 7 games against Villa. And in which Villa have finished the season above the world’s most Ridiculously Entitled Football Club 3 times out of 3 (including last season obviously, when everyone else finished above REFC too).",
      "So maybe the media build-up to the game may have focused on what Spurs were going to have to focus on doing to beat an opponent they often struggle against? Maybe the commentary during the game would have suggested that the Daniel Levy Thunderdome Conference Centre ™ might have posh toilets but it is not actually a good place to play football; and if REFC concentrate on what the opposition can do, they might have more chance? Possibly the coverage after the game could have recognised that rather than going overboard on Spurs being sloppy and some amazing God from the machine moments from Villa, there could have been a glimmer of recognition that Villa are… just better?",
      "But no. Because of course, any of this would require club and media to get over themselves. When Conte and Mourinho and even Ange – Ange Postecoglou! – were explaining to the world that there is an attitude problem at James Maddison Football Club, did anyone listen? When Rio Ferdinand was banging on about Djed Spence – Djed Spence! – being the best one-on-one defender in England, we probably should have all been running to the bookmakers to put the house on Spurs conceding goals from the Spence zone. But will this be forgotten by the next time the England squad is announced? You bet it will. A Spurs player puts his shirt on the right way round and suddenly a star is born.",
      "Being ‘Spursy’ is not a thing. ‘Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory’ is not unique to Tottenham at all. Clubs good enough to win frequently, without access to the final 0.1% of quality to keep getting over the line regularly enough to be the best, are all in this position. What is unique to Tottenham is a colossal ego with absolutely nothing to back it up. But the results they get are normal. The performances and outcomes are all normal. If they attract new signings to the club because of the allure of London, they should not be surprised to have a lot of ‘injuries’. They are not cursed. There is no spell preventing the club from becoming Liverpool. Pretending they’re driving an F1 car when playing Mariokart will not result in success.",
      "And while I’m here, a quick note to everyone who should know better (I don’t know if Barney Ronay reads, or indeed is someone who should know better).

The last time I went to that pub was 5 April, the day Palace beat Brighton 2-1 despite being reduced to nine men. What odds that our next visit will end up being 14 March, the day Palace host Leeds United? That seems to have good madness potential.",
      "* As plenty of us have said before, there is something incredibly fun about supporting this particular Crystal Palace team. They just don’t know when they’re beaten and regardless of the opposition, will throw everything at getting back into the game, then go behind and do it again, before missing a glorious chance to actually win the thing. Some things never change. I can’t decide whether it feels harsh to criticise them for not stealing all three points, or if it’s actually justifiable because Oliver Glasner has raised expectations. The same applies to Jean-Philippe Mateta: he deserves a lot of praise for scoring a hat-trick, two of which were classic centre-forward goals and the other was a stoppage time penalty that required a lot of composure; however, having done all that, he was in the perfect position for another textbook centre-forward goal to win the match and couldn’t convert the chance. Incidentally, had he scored a fourth, he would have been the first Crystal Palace player to do so since Johnny Byrne in 1960, when the Glaziers (as they then were) played in Division Four.",
      "* Overall though a draw with a side as good as Bournemouth is a good result for Palace, particularly after their club record unbeaten run was ended last time out. Palace fans think we’ve come a long way but we’re far behind the Cherries on that front. Andoni Iraola has them playing good football with a sense of ambition towards the European places that is far more realistic than other recent occupants of the Bournemouth dugout. Had Iraola’s team won on Saturday, they would have very briefly gone top of the Premier League, something inconceivable for most of their history but the way they’re playing this season makes perfect sense – in that respect, a point for Palace is a good result.",
      "* The family I was visiting was my octogenarian father in law and his partner. Watching the lunchtime game and the fallout led to some predictable conversations, like “why do they have to have a woman commentating”, “you don’t see players with names like Smith and Jones anymore”, and “where are all the British managers”. My answers to those were that Lucy Ward is actually a good co-commentator, you support Liverpool, who have a midfielder called Jones, and that in what is broadly a meritocracy, the British managers they mean aren’t good enough anymore. As Alan Shearer said on Match of the Day, there are only 20 Premier League jobs at any given time, so when one becomes available there will always be a long line of candidates, even when the club is in as much disarray as Nottingham Forest. People from all over the world will apply, so it would be incredibly strange if the strongest candidate ended up being Sam Allardyce, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes or Alan Pardew.",
      "* A side effect of Forest’s decision to sack Ange Postecoglou was that MOTD viewers had to sit through Micah Richards trotting out some incredibly tired analysis of the situation. Postecoglu had eight games, none of which ended in a victory and for most of which his team were absolutely dire. Eight games isn’t very long, but if his ideas were going to take effect at all, there would have been some sign of it happening before now. Richards said managers need time, but the manager who needs the time is the one who has to come in and fix the mess caused by the owner’s handling of the previous two managers, both of whom drew unfortunate comparisons with Roy Hodgson: Nuno Espirito Santo because of how reluctant his team could be to attack, and Postecoglu because of his teams’ unfortunate habit of conceding soon after half time. I’ve no idea what he says to people but, like Hodgson at Palace, you wonder if he would have been better off saying absolutely nothing.",
      "* People really need to stop comparing the current Arsenal team to Tony Pulis’s Stoke City, at least until an opposing player has done something ridiculous in a panic trying not to concede a set piece opportunity. Think players conceding corners so they didn’t have to defend a Rory Delap long throw, that’s the bar.",
      "* Liverpool conceding goals because their defenders are ball-watching instead of tracking the players they’re supposed to be marking? I for one am shocked by this. Well, I might be if I hadn’t watched Liverpool regularly for the past few years and mentioning it on a regular basis. I don’t think they need to worry too much about losing to Manchester United. It seems like when United were challenging for the title (a long time ago now obviously), they would often lose to Liverpool, so it makes perfect sense that the same would be true the other way round.\nEd Quoththeraven",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

      "In the summer, Man Utd’s transfer business split opinion as they narrowly found themselves in our losers column.",
      "Meanwhile, it was difficult not to be uber-positive about Liverpool‘s business as they made an almighty statement with their £400m+ overhaul.",
      "But eight games into the 2025/26 campaign, on-field performances have forced a rather significant U-turn regarding the Premier League giants’ respective work.",
      "With Marc Guehi being the only notable exception, Liverpool secured most of their top transfer targets in key positions. They also recouped cash via sensible market opportunities, with Jarell Quansah and Harvey Elliott offloaded and given a route back, while Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz were sold for large fees.",
      "Given how well Diaz and Quansah have been performing for Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen, there is an argument that they should not have been sold, but Liverpool get a pass here due to the form of their best attacker, Cody Gakpo, on the left and the safety net of the buy-back clause for the centre-back.",

      "Liverpool broke the British transfer record twice in the summer to sign Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, but each player has massively underdelivered this season.",
      "Isak is suffering a lasting effect of an inactive summer, and the Man Utd game, which Arne Slot said was the first to properly judge him, was another non-event for the former Newcastle United striker, who will inevitably come good even if it takes him a few months.",
      "It’s a similar story with Wirtz, who has at least shown in flashes what he is capable of, but he has not been put in the right positions to shine and is currently not doing enough to ease the scrutiny directed his way.",
      "More pressing concerns are at full-back, as highlighted as a “weakness” by Man Utd, because Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong have been nowhere near the level previously set by Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold in those positions.",

      "Though Ibrahima Konate had one of his better games of this season against Man Utd, Liverpool’s failure to land Guehi has had a negative impact as Virgil van Dijk has been miles off it, thus ensuring that their defence is incredibly fragile.",
      "So, in this summer’s window, FSG were far from transfer masters and were actually pretty inept as they forced through too many changes in a single window, signed the wrong profile of player in certain positions and overlooked glaring weaknesses in other departments (i.e. at centre-back).",
      "Man Utd and INEOS, meanwhile, are currently coming out smelling of roses following the summer window.",
      "Don’t get me wrong, they are far from perfect; their failure to sign a No.6 continues to bite them as they were still too easy to play through against Liverpool and were fortunate not to be punished.",
      "There is also the situation of some of the ‘bomb squad’, obviously except Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho, returning to form elsewhere, but they were dead weight at Old Trafford and INEOS were at least patient enough to secure straight fees/loan with obligation to buy deals for these players.",

      "In years to come, Harry Maguire’s redemption arc will be studied. More immediately, it should be used as the template for his manager and many of his Manchester United team-mates.",
      "Maguire added to his increasing catalogue of huge goals for United by heading in a late winner to seal the Red Devils’ first victory at Anfield since 2016. No player in the near-year Ruben Amorim has been in charge has come up clutch for the manager more than the 32-year-old.",
      "A winner at Anfield. Sparking bedlam when completing the comeback against Lyon. Another late header to beat his old club Leicester in the FA Cup. He almost dug Amorim out at Grimsby with a last-minute equaliser.",
      "Those are just the goals. A theme running through Amorim’s biggest victories is Maguire’s rock-solid presence at the back. In the manager’s first derby at the Etihad, Maguire pocketed Erling Haaland. At Arsenal, in the FA Cup, he was a outstanding. Twice now at Anfield for Amorim, the centre-back has been huge at both ends.",
      "Maguire has been talismanic for this manager, and considering the depths from which he has recovered, he more than anyone else is the example to follow in the United dressing room.",
      "The apologies are never as loud as the disrespect, or in Maguire’s case, criticism, mockery and abuse. But if those who vilified the defender queued up to give him his dues, the back of the line would stretch to Ghana and the constituency of MP Isaac Adongo.",
      "He was the politician who fired a cheap-shot from his nation’s parliament when Maguire was struggling for form. Yes, that’s putting it mildly. Maguire endured a truly wretched 2021-22, coinciding with his arrest on holiday in Greece. Maguire was a man down and the world relished in piling in to give him a kicking.",
      "At least Adongo went on the record to apologise to Maguire – ‘sorry’ isn’t as shareable on socials, though, is it? – who accepted with the grace and dignity he showed for the most part through a tortuous two years.",
      "Roy Keane also admitted he took at least one of his rants against Maguire too far. But Keane and MP Adongo were just jumping aboard the biggest bandwagon of the time.",
      "Maguire was panned by pundits and singled out as a figure of fun by a media playing to its public. We were probably guilty of that somewhere along the line. And United fans – players, even – cannot claim they were above the treatment meted out to their man under seige.",
      "He was booed across the world on pre-season tours, from Australia to America and back to Dublin. Stretford Enders will always differentiate themselves from the tourists and the online fanbase, but Maguire was also jeered at Old Trafford.",
      "His club hardly helped. Erik ten Hag stripped Maguire of the United captaincy in 2023, which may or may not have been the correct call, but it is a demotion from which many players’ egos would never recover.",
      "If that was too subtle on United’s part, that same summer, Maguire would have got the message that he wasn’t wanted anymore when the club publicly agreed to sell him to West Ham. At that point, it was almost a mercy mission on the Hammers’ part, and to anyone outside Maguire’s circle, a change of scene and a fresh start seemed the only sensible choice.",

      "But Maguire showed the kind of stubbornness and mental fortitude not often seen at Old Trafford in recent years. Unlike many ex-team-mates who couldn’t run away from the circus quick enough, Maguire has repeatedly proven his determination not only to achieve personal redemption, but collective too.",
      "Amorim cannot claim to have fixed Maguire. Within half a season of rejecting a move away from United, he won Premier League Player of the Month for December 2023 under Ten Hag. But Amorim and Maguire have certainly been good for one another.",
      "It helps Maguire that his manager prefers an abundance of centre-backs in a system we know he won’t change. Perhaps the defender is fortunate too that his particular skillset is back in demand while Premier League managers explore again the aerial route to goal.",
      "That includes Amorim. When he and United get really desperate – an all-too-often occurrence in the last 12 months – Maguire is dispatched from his own box to the opposition’s to serve as Amorim’s trusted cross magnet.",
      "Do not simply attribute Maguire’s aerial prowess to size or stature. The art of winning such duels is in timing and judgement. Crosses and set-pieces were seemingly viewed as boorish by many coaches desperate to prove their purity for a while then. Now, though, the bullet header is back. And few do it better than Maguire, evidenced by the moments that will define him as a cult hero when he leaves Old Trafford of his own accord, with his bulbous bonce held higher than even he could reasonably have dreamed two years ago.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham felt like a perfect union but things are already starting to collapse. The Portuguese would make history by being sacked.",
      "As soon as Ousmane Dembele was awarded the 2025 Ballon d’Or, the speculation must begin about the 2026 iteration.",
      "There are pleas for Arne Slot to be sacked and pleas for patience for Arne Slot. But some things do need to change.",
      "Liverpool are still one of the most frequent TV picks in the Premier League so far this season, with Chelsea replaced at the top by three other teams.",
      "You thought you knew Arne Slot? Just wait until you hear what he did on holiday in Dubai.",

      "Man Utd legend Dwight Yorke reckons Ruben Amorim’s side can start looking towards a possible top-six finish after beating Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "The Red Devils won at Anfield for the first time since 2016 with Amorim victorious in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since taking over last season.",
      "Amorim is still under pressure if he doesn’t keep up current form after picking up just 40 points from his first 35 Premier League matches in charge at Man Utd.",
      "And Yorke has now urged Man Utd and Amorim to build on their shock result on Merseyside and warned them not to now “fall back into the decline”.",
      "Reacting to the win over Man Utd, Yorke exclusively told Football365 on behalf of Escapist Magazine: “Massive win. I think a lot of people didn’t probably give United any chance of getting three points there, despite, you know, Liverpool not really being on song with the three defeats prior to that game. Man U getting the first win [at Anfield] for a while.",
      "“But it was never going to be an easy task with it at Anfield, we know that we haven’t won there in 10 years either, so the likelihood of getting the result, I think it was very slim. However, the boys have turned up and delivered another fantastic performance and a result that not too many people had given them a chance. And on top of that, winning two games back to back, which they haven’t been able to do. So it’s been a real uptick, and a lot of happy United fans including myself yesterday.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Amorim, Slot, Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal and so many more",
      "“Is this the kind of result that can change United’s season? You should hope so, beating one of your rivals. We know the City derby is huge, but nothing like Liverpool. The history between those two clubs, and so you would have thought that will.",
      "“If that doesn’t give you the incentive and the additional confidence to go forward, I’m not so sure what will. So I hope that with this result and the back-to-back wins will then inspire the players that it can be done, and that will inspire them and give them the extra confidence going into the rest of the campaign.",
      "“The one thing they’ve got to be safeguarding against is the fact that after they win against Liverpool, everyone is coming after them, and you have to have a reaction for that. So what you can’t afford to allow to happen is getting these two good results, which are huge results against Liverpool, and then falling back into the decline. So it’ll be interesting.",
      "“All eyes will be on them the next game that they play. And you don’t want to make one step forward and two steps backwards. I hope they don’t fall into that old cliché one and get carried away and think that’s it and they could live on the back of just the Liverpool results. They need to kick on.”",
      "When asked what the target is for the rest of the season, Yorke added: “I think top four, it’s usually the usual standard. They’ve got to get back to the top six. Top four will be a remarkable return.",
      "“No one envisaged that, even myself, who is obviously a United fan. I’ll be happy with top six considering where we finished last season, because that’s an uptick. It’d be an uphill task. But what we see is that everybody can beat each other at any given time and United certainly can do that. But they gotta get back on a much more consistent base.",
      "“I always revert back to just beat the teams around you. Beat the teams who you are supposed to beat on paper. It’s when you’re getting beaten against those teams that it’s a bit worrying. We know they can produce these kinds of performances against Liverpool and City in the past, and you’ve got to roll your sleeves up and get results against the lesser teams.”",
      "Liverpool are not dealing well with “becoming the hunted” after winning the Premier League title last season, according to Dwight Yorke."

The tiniest bit of pressure (most of that being self inflicted after spending HALF A BILLION of the king’s finest) has seen them panic.

      "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot proved that he’s a salty Jurgen Klopp regen with two stupid comments about Manchester United on Sunday…",
      "Slot has been a media darling for most of his tenure at Liverpool and has been widely praised for his forthright assessments of games in front of cameras immediately after the final whistle.",
      "However, cracks in his image are starting to appear as pressure mounts on the Liverpool boss amid a dire run of four straight losses in all competitions.",
      "Liverpool’s mini-crisis before the international break turned into a full-blown crisis on Sunday afternoon as they were deservedly beaten 2-1 by arch-rivals Manchester United at Anfield.",
      "Subsequently, Wayne Rooney has raised a worrying change he’s seen in Slot, who has been showing similar character traits to his predecessor, Klopp, when on the end of a disappointing result.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Liverpool 1-2 Man United: Panicking Liverpool rattle themselves into crisis",
      "Klopp was the sorest of losers when things didn’t go his way and Slot stopped short of praising Man Utd by making daft comments about their playing style and Ruben Amorim’s decision regarding Benjamin Sesko.",
      "“If you play United – who come here with a low block and playing a lot of long balls and you know that is going to be difficult as it’s not easy to play through them and you don’t get the chance to win the ball high up – and you concede after one or two minutes, it makes it harder,” Slot said.",
      "“It’s always difficult to defend against a team that defends in a low block, that mainly plays long balls.",
      "“But it makes it even more difficult when you go 1-0 down after one minute when a player of ours is on the floor.",
      "“If you would have told me before the game that against the low block, against the team that plays so many long balls, we would have created as many chances as we did, I would not have expected us to lose this game of football.”",
      "READ: Slot ‘ain’t the guy’ – he’s a ‘d***head’ who can’t ‘manage his way out of this hole’ at Liverpool",
      "Before the game, Slot commented on Amorim’s decision not to start Sesko. He said: “We’ve seen Sesko play the last three, four, five or six times, but they go to Liverpool they change the line-up.",
      "“That’s not the first where we’ve faced a team and they’ve done that.”",
      "Starting with the long balls, Man Utd did play more than Liverpool (75-47) and their long pass proportion was 25.5% compared to 9.8% for their opponents.",
      "But this is only an issue in Slot’s mind because his team came up short, having been outsmarted by Amorim and his team.",
      "Put simply, Slot needs to focus on being better to quell the threat of Man Utd and other teams that have had success against Liverpool, with the Reds and their head coach made to look pretty inept by Amorim.",
      "According to Opta, Man Utd’s ratio of long passes against Liverpool was their highest since the 3-1 win over Arsenal in December 2017, so this was a tactic deployed to increase their chances of success at Anfield, which is also the case with the rotation of Sesko.",
      "Sesko being on the bench amid his strong form before the international break raised eyebrows, but this, like the focus on long passes, was an inspired decision from Amorim as Man Utd’s fluid and mobile front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount caused Liverpool’s fragile defence no end of problems.",
      "And Amorim is obviously within his rights to tinker with his XI from game-to-game to get the better of an opponent, which is exactly what happened against Liverpool and Slot.",
      "Amorim got all of his major decisions spot on as he schooled Slot, while blind panic got the better of the Liverpool boss as he and his team were deservedly punished.",

      "The 24-year-old has largely performed well for the French side since moving with 21 goals and five assists in 34 Ligue Un appearances last term.",

      "And now Spanish publication Fichajes insists that Man Utd have ‘decided to take an ambitious step in the market and is preparing an outlay of close to €100m to repatriate’ Greenwood in the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘Manchester United let Mason Greenwood leave for Olympique Marseille in 2024 for around €26 million and retains a 50% release clause on his future sale. Sources close to the English club indicate they are not satisfied with receiving that portion and want to rectify the situation with an outright purchase.",
      "‘In Manchester, they suggest that the €100 million fee would allow Mason Greenwood to be brought back without sharing profits or depending on subsequent release clauses. The club values ​​both his performance in France and his commercial potential following his improved image.’",
      "Despite a sale elsewhere meaning Man Utd ‘would still receive a significant percentage thanks to his resale clause, they prefer to assume the cost now and gain full control of the player’.",
      "When asked whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better. He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "“He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it’s necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he’s always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.”",
      "Previously speaking of Greenwood’s potential, De Zerbi said: “All the credit goes to his mother and father. And I’m here to help him become more complete. When he needs a hug, a word of support, I gladly give it. And when I need to push him to give more, I have to do that too because that’s my job.",
      "“I would especially like to help him be remembered, in this stadium and by these supporters, as one of the greatest players to have played here at the Velodrome. There have been so many great players here, but I think Greenwood has the qualities to be remembered that way. And I’m trying to help him progress.”",
      "De Zerbi continued: “If he wants to become a great player, he must run off the ball. I saw Mbappe, I saw Dembele pressing without the ball, and Greenwood has to do it too. He has worked on pressing, but not always. When he wants to, he does it, and he must understand that this effort is what separates the greats.”",

      "Manchester United pulled off a shock victory to beat the Premier League's reigning champions Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield but how did they do it? We pick out the key reasons why Ruben Amorim was able to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time...",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 21:52, UK",
      "",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot seemed surprised by United's team selection from the outset as Amorim omitted Benjamin Sesko despite the striker scoring in his previous two Premier League appearances for the club and starting in each of the last four.",
      "In fact, it wasn't. Matheus Cunha took on the centre-forward duties, but did not give Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate such a reference point for them to mark. \"If we [play] Ben I think it is easier for these type of centre-backs to control our striker,\" said Amorim.",
      "Amorim was also rewarded for his positive decision to keep Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo together on the right rather than opting for a more defensively-minded wing-back. It paid off in little over a minute when the pair combined for the opening goal.",
      "Milos Kerkez, Liverpool's summer signing from Bournemouth, has been targeted by numerous teams this season and that appeared to have been identified as a weakness United could exploit. \"Kerkez does not look comfortable,\" said Jamie Carragher early on.",
      "Kerkez's uncertainty seems to have had a knock-on effect on the once imperious Van Dijk. \"Normally the right-hand side of Liverpool's defence gets punished,\" pointed out Gary Neville. \"But today it's the left hand side. Kerkez and Van Dijk have struggled.\"",
      "The goal immediately increased the tension inside Anfield. Van Dijk was urging Ryan Gravenberch to be calmer as early as the sixth minute when the midfielder attempted an ambitious pass in behind. \"We were far too rushed,\" said the captain after the game.",
      "Slot repeatedly referenced United's use of long balls afterwards but that was a smart play at Anfield, denying Liverpool the opportunity to win the ball high up the pitch through their pressing. Senne Lammens booted the ball away time and time again.",
      "In fact, the Belgian goalkeeper has the lowest pass completion rate of any Premier League goalkeeper to play 180 minutes this season. The top two goalkeepers? Giorgi Mamardashvili and Alisson Becker, both of Liverpool. A clash of styles. United's won out.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim got his tactics spot on at Anfield,\" said Carragher while analysing the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"It's not just about going long; he didn't pick [Benjamin] Sesko, he picked [Matheus] Cunha to be under the ball.",
      "\"The important thing to notice is how narrow the players are, it's not about going long, it's about picking up the second ball.",
      "\"It was all about picking up the second ball. Look how narrow the five players are. That's where the first goal comes from.",
      "\"The tactic of going long was spot on.\"",
      "Inevitably, Liverpool pushed in the second half, Slot's bold substitutions just after the hour mark meaning wave after wave of attacks towards the Kop followed. The home side got their equaliser but Amorim noted afterwards that the response was crucial.",
      "\"We managed well when we suffered the goal, we managed that moment well and that is the key point for our team.\" The momentum was with Liverpool but United managed to retain enough composure to stay in it and find a winning goal of their own.",
      "It came from the second phase after a corner. Amorim had included Harry Maguire because of his aerial ability in his own box, but it proved decisive at the other end of the pitch. Liverpool have now conceded five goals from set-pieces already this season.",
      "\"Defending in a set-piece at 1-1, it happened to us at Palace and again today,\" said Slot. The Liverpool boss pointed out that his team created far more from open play but acknowledged that set-pieces are part of the game. \"That is something we have to do [better].\"",
      "There was still time for Liverpool to equalise but Cunha came into his own in those closing stages. \"Cunha has one characteristic that can help the team move forward,\" Amorim said beforehand and he showed in late on, often getting United up the field.",
      "\"More or less all the transitions was Cunha. He was so far from the centre-backs and that helped us to take the ball,\" said Amorim afterwards. The Brazilian could be seen celebrating after winning a free-kick in stoppage time. His role was vital for United.",
      "Carragher also went on to explain on Monday Night Football how United's use of a 5-4-1 formation out of possession allowed Amorim's squad to remain compact throughout the fixture, with their only moments of weakness arriving when the team became separated as a result of players pressing Liverpool.",
      "\"The talk of the low-block, it was the right thing to do,\" Carragher said.",
      "\"On a couple of occasions, when United tried to go after Liverpool and press, that's where they had problems. If they got caught out, there was space in behind.",
      "\"That's when United they are at their worst, when the team are spread out. The team are separated. It comes from them pressing high. They were right to not go after Liverpool and to play in a 5-4-1 low-block.\"",
      "Of course, Liverpool had their chances and Cody Gakpo, who had hit the frame of the goal three times before scoring, could and should have had a second. But Neville summed it up well. \"When you come to Anfield, you need a little bit of luck.\" United earned theirs.",

      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:17, UK",
      "Harry Maguire stunned Liverpool as his 84th-minute header clinched Manchester United's first win at Anfield since 2016 and condemned the hosts to a fourth consecutive defeat.",
      "Maguire guided in Bruno Fernandes's cross just six minutes after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out a controversial opening goal from Bryan Mbeumo only 62 seconds into a thrilling contest.",
      "Mbeumo beat Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo's pass to leave Anfield shellshocked but Liverpool were furious play wasn't stopped for a head injury to Alexis Mac Allister, who went down in the build-up after colliding with Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Liverpool: Mamardashvili (5), Bradley (6), Van Dijk (5), Konate (6), Kerkez (5), Gravenberch (6), Szoboszlai (7), Mac Allister (6), Salah (5), Gakpo (7), Isak (5).\n\n\nSubs: Jones (6), Wirtz (6), Ekitike (6), Chiesa (7), Frimpong (6).\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), De Ligt (7), Maguire (8), Shaw (7), Dalot (5), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (8), Amad (8), Mount (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ugarte (5), Dorgu (5), Sesko (6), Yoro (n/a), Mainoo (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Harry Maguire",
      "Mac Allister needed treatment and had to play on wearing protective headgear but VAR could not intervene as there was no foul. Guidance from the Premier League Match Centre suggested referee Michael Oliver did not stop play as he did not see the injury.",
      "The dramatic opening set the tone for a pulsating game with Manchester United initially resisting Liverpool's efforts to equalise with the help of some luck. Gakpo struck the post three times before finally hauling the hosts level when he tucked home substitute Federico Chiesa's low cross.",
      "The out-of-form Mohamed Salah had also missed two gilt-edged chances but it felt like Liverpool were primed to find a winner before Maguire struck to spark more jubilant celebrations from Manchester United, who might have had a second goal in the first half had Fernandes not fired wide from a big chance.",
      "Liverpool tried to rally again in the closing stages but Gakpo missed a glorious opportunity, heading wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross when it looked easier to score, leaving them to face up to a fourth consecutive loss for the first time since 2014, having also been beaten by Chelsea, Galatasaray and Crystal Palace.",
      "A momentous victory for Manchester United means they have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim. It puts them only two points behind Liverpool in the table, with the champions four points off leaders Arsenal in third.",
      "\"In the first five or six games it was about the signings we made, now it's about Mo Salah.",
      "\"We had more than enough chances to score. Mo missed a big one. Some others missed a big chances. We are not used to this.",
      "\"We needed a goal, but we needed a player who could create something in that end phase. That's what Jeremie [Frimpong, who came on for Salah] did, he had a great action, crossed to Cody.",
      "\"If we had been 3-0 up, Cody would have scored. I cannot guarantee this. So every player has tried everything. But it didn't work out for us.\"",
      "\"It's three points but it's a good victory. I will do the same thing I did in the last few games which is try to see the game back.",
      "\"In key points we had some luck, but we fought for every ball.",
      "\"We lost our composure in the second half. But the most important thing was the spirit was there.",
      "\"That is the beginning of everything. Sometimes you play more with the ball, other days you play without the ball.",
      "\"But if you have the spirit, you can win any game.",
      "\"They had had the better of us over the last few years and it's not been good for our club.",
      "\"We have not given our fans enough days like today, so it has been a long time coming, coming to this ground and picking up three points.",
      "\"It is not just three points to the club and to the boys. I have been coming to this ground for seven years now and to not get three points has been tough. It's for the fans and I hope they had a great night tonight.",
      "\"We won't get carried away because we can't afford that as a club, we will use it as motivation.\"",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Ruben Amorim had cited his set-piece threat and he delivered.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.",
      "\"He needed something, the pressure was building but a win at Anfield is huge.",
      "\"It's a great place for Manchester United to win a game of football.",
      "\"It's a big period coming up, the manager is under pressure and they pulled something out of the bag.",

      "Plus: Morgan Rogers repays Unai Emery's faith as resurgent Aston Villa inflict more woe on Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium",
      "Sunday 19 October 2025 20:52, UK",
      "",
      "Curtis Jones and Florian Wirtz in a midfield two? It was surely not the plan at half past four in the afternoon, let alone in the summer. But this was Liverpool with a little over an hour gone against Manchester United at Anfield. Let the chaos ensue.",
      "It has been their season in microcosm, a wildness highlighted on the opening night of the campaign in a prickly conversation between Arne Slot and Jamie Carragher. Liverpool beat Bournemouth that evening. But the control they had is clearly gone.",
      "They created enough chances to beat Manchester United. Slot was at pains to point that out. Cody Gakpo struck the frame of the goal on three separate occasions. Mohamed Salah missed a chance so inviting that Curtis Jones was already celebrating.",
      "\"I do not think it is usual that we are missing so many chances. This weekend again, set-pieces are such a crucial part. We are the team that creates the most in open play, I don't think that has changed. But that is not the only way to win a game.\"",
      "He is right. Liverpool have created 85 chances from open play, the most of any team in the Premier League. But he is also right to mention the defending from set-pieces. There is a vulnerability to Liverpool now and the two may be related. It is about balance.",
      "Milos Kerkez shone for Bournemouth last season but is struggling at left-back, targeted each week by opponents who sense weakness. Virgil van Dijk looks less sure of himself too, leaving that flank exposed. The captain himself was culpable for the opener.",
      "There was an irony to Van Dijk preaching calm afterwards because more urgency from him might have helped instead of allowing Bryan Mbeumo to drag himself from the deck and sprint in behind the Liverpool defence to fire United ahead after 62 seconds.",
      "Composed can soon come to be seen as lackadaisical once the goals start going in against you. It is 11 conceded after eight Premier League games this season compared to the miserly three that gave Liverpool the platform for success last time out.",
      "Too often, Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up. \"When you are 1-0 down, you need to take more risks,\" said Slot. Hence, the sight of his Galacticos arrowing forward towards the Kop late on, all talent and no cohesion as they chased goals - and lost.",
      "\"I think we had six or seven offensive players on the pitch and that may be the reason why the structure of a set-piece against Palace and now was not as perfect as usual because normally you play four or five defensive-minded players,\" Slot explained.",
      "There is an element of living and dying by that same sword. It was not so long ago that Liverpool were snatching games late on having gone chasing for the winner. Now, they are losing to late goals. Three points for a win might well justify the approach in the end.",
      "In terms of expected goals, this was the highest total that Liverpool have racked up in any Premier League game since beating Southampton in March. But when Jamie Redknapp talked of \"an air of desperation\", you understand what he meant by it.",
      "On paper, Liverpool have some splendid players. On the pitch, the blend is still not right. Slot appears willing to trust that things will click very soon. But his team will need to make sure their rivals don't snatch the crown while they are figuring it out.Adam Bate",
      "Harry Maguire's inclusion at the expense of Leny Yoro against Liverpool surprised many but the 32-year-old has a habit of proving his doubters wrong. Rubem Amorim had cited his set-piece threat before the game and he delivered just when he was needed.",
      "His goal, guided home from Bruno Fernandes's delicate cross, means he joins Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Robin van Persie, Carlos Tevez, John O'Shea, Ryan Giggs and Diego Forlan on the list of Manchester United players to have scored winners at Anfield.",
      "It is an illustrious group and nobody can begrudge Maguire his place in it. He has been written off on numerous occasions. Manchester United have tried to move him on. But he continues to play a vital role and this might be his biggest contribution yet.",
      "It was cathartic for him in a sense. On Manchester United's last visit to Anfield in January, for a 2-2 draw, he missed a late chance to win it, ending up with his head in his hands. This time, he ended up leading the celebrations, a nine-year wait over.",
      "He excelled defensively too. Manchester United needed luck on their side, with Cody Gakpo hitting the woodwork three times before his equaliser. But Maguire certainly made their life harder, winning headers, making clearances, and ultimately winning the game.Nick Wright",
      "\"I suppose I might have been a surprise package last year, but now people know about me and know my game.\"",
      "And his start to the season, without a goal in seven games, reinforced how he has become a marked man.",
      "Head coach Unai Emery wasn't prepared to give up on him, though. Rogers has started all of their Premier League and Europa League matches.",
      "\"He is always doing his task. He is a hard worker,\" explained Emery. \"And through it, the performance is coming.",
      "\"He's playing and he's scoring because he's helping the team for 90 minutes.\"",
      "Rogers' stunning strike against Tottenham was the only shot he had during the match. It was a bolt from the blue, but one that can help reinstall his confidence after a tricky period in his career.David Richardson",
      "The sound of boos at the full-time whistle has become a regular occurrence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs' home form is alarming. Their supporters have seen just three wins at home in the last 18 Premier League games.",
      "In fact, the 2-1 loss to Aston Villa means it is Tottenham's poorest home start to a league campaign since 2008/09.",
      "Since November 10 last year, Spurs have lost more home games than any other ever-present Premier League side.Frank has been unable to solve an issue which developed under his predecessor Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Asked to explain their home struggles, the Dane said at his post-match press conference: \"I don't think it's that simple. It's about looking into the performances.",
      "\"I think we performed well against Burnley, I think we performed well today. I think we had one very good first half against Wolves, and we were bad against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We could easily have won it instead of Villa, and then it would have been a different narrative, so I look at the performance on the pitch at what we did well and look at what we need to improve.\"",
      "Frank, then, will be relieved their next three games are all away."

      "Gary Neville says the next few weeks are \"crucial\" for Ruben Amorim's Manchester United era - and believes they should be able to get into the top six after a dramatic win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "United have risen to ninth in the table following Harry Maguire's 84th-minute winner against arch-rivals Liverpool, after Cody Gakpo cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's 61-second opener.",
      "\"This is a complete turnaround game,\" said Neville about the win over Liverpool on the Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I thought if United lose here, which they were more than likely to do when I saw the team sheet, I'm thinking Ruben Amorim is going into that Brighton game under real pressure with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham to come.",
      "\"They've got a kickstart springboard from what they've done, because to win at Anfield is special in any season, to win here is the hardest ground. They should be really proud because it's a big achievement, but they've got to kick on from here.",
      "\"So it's a great day for Manchester United, but let's see it again next Saturday night against Brighton.\"",
      "Neville cited the recent defeat at Brentford in September as a prime example for United to avoid. Amorim's side had just beaten Chelsea at home in a big game to kickstart their season - but a defeat to the Bees a week later put United back where they started.",
      "\"So what can't happen is now we've got to this height of performance, and then all of a sudden Brighton ends up being a dip,\" said Neville. \"So the next couple of weeks are huge, I think, for Ruben Amorim to start to build.",
      "\"Amorim has got to start trusting those players. I know we talk about trusting Ruben Amorim and him being under pressure, and that's always going to be the case with the manager, but Ruben Amorim wants to be able to trust his players.",
      "\"I know he likes them, and I know the players like him, you can see that. There's no sort of players losing the dressing room type stuff, which we have seen with United many times.",
      "\"There's no doubt those players admire their coach, they like him as a person, but they've got to start trusting each other, trust the system if you're the players, but also Ruben Amorim, trust his players that they can deliver consistently.",
      "\"I'm just looking towards next week now. Enjoy tonight because it's one of the greatest moments you can have as a United player, winning at Anfield, and it happens rarely, so enjoy tonight.",
      "\"But honestly, lads, you've got to get back at it tomorrow morning, you've got to switch on and focus, because next Saturday will kick you right where you don't want it to kick you, if you're not at your best.",
      "\"Brighton are a good side, so really start to focus so hard on that in terms of everything that you do this week.\"",
      "Neville believes the United squad are capable of finishing in the top six - not just because of the quality of their squad, but also the lack of European football giving them free weeks of training all season.",
      "\"They've just gone into the top half of the table, to ninth, and I think if they win next week, they've got to start thinking of pushing up the league,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Because they've got to get to a point whereby there's stability at the club, the only way there's going to be stability is through winning football matches.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got a top six squad, particularly when you know that they haven't got European football, and they haven't got the Carabao Cup now.",
      "\"If you look at the four or five players they've got up front in Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Amad Diallo, and Bryan Mbeumo, Mason Mount, and Bruno Fernandes behind them. And then the centre-backs they've got - Leny Yoro, Matthijs De Ligt, Harry Maguire, Luke Shaw, they should be able to get a top six finish with the free weeks out of that squad.\"",
      "Amorim admitted he will not dwell on or celebrate this victory too much, with the Portuguese fully aware of the importance the Brighton game will bring next weekend.",
      "\"It [victory over Liverpool] doesn't mean a lot. It means [a lot] today. But tomorrow it is not going to mean a lot. It's three points but it's a good victory.",
      "\"It will give us more confidence in the week. It will give us a lot of pleasure to our fans who deserve it after Grimsby and Brentford. To have a win like this is really important. That is on our hands. This game is in the past, let's focus on the future.\""

      "Player ratings as Man Utd beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield to claim first back-to-back league wins under Ruben Amorim; Harry Maguire headed winning goal after Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo's acrimonious opener; Liverpool have lost four games in a row for the first time since 2014",
      "By Peter Smith and Zinny Boswell",
      "Monday 20 October 2025 07:18, UK",
      "Giorgi Mamardashvili - 5",
      "Mamardashvili talked up his readiness to replace Alisson while he was away on loan last season but looked nervous on this big stage - perhaps flustered after failing to save Bryan Mbeumo's early drive through him.",
      "Could do little about Harry Maguire's header but also spilt a Matheus Cunha cross and was fortunate Mason Mount couldn't tuck away the loose ball. There were a couple of good stops midway through the first half but unconvincing.",
      "Conor Bradley - 6",
      "Misplaced just one of his 26 passes but will be frustrated not to have troubled the United defence. Miscontrolled in the box at start of the second half when he looked primed to deliver a dangerous cross. Off after an hour and saw Szoboszlai go into his right-back spot. That position is still up for grabs.",
      "Ibrahima Konate - 6",
      "Out-jumped by Harry Maguire for the winner to spoil what had been an otherwise impressive performance. Konate has copped plenty of flak this season but it was he who was regularly covering for centre-back pal Virgil van Dijk on Sunday. He couldn't get across to stop Mbeumo's goal but made plenty of other interventions amid the chaos of that first half and played a fantastic pass for Isak's big one-on-one chance.",
      "Virgil van Dijk - 5",
      "Usually imperious but Van Dijk was at fault for Mbeumo's goal, clattering his team-mate Mac Allister and ending up out of position before strangely trying to hand over the goalscorer to Konate. Turned by Cunha and needed Konate to cover in one of several examples of the Dutchman being caught out. His passing and aerial threat were there - his authority was not.",
      "Milos Kerkez - 5",
      "The left-back looked overawed in the first half and had to be told to calm down by Van Dijk on a couple of occasions. Their miscommunication continued in the second half when his centre-back kicked the ball in his face. Didn't look comfortable up against Amad.",
      "Ryan Gravenberch - 6",
      "Set the tempo at the base of Liverpool's midfield, playing a deeper role than he has ventured into at times this season but rolled his ankle worryingly early in the second half and had to come off soon after.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister - 6",
      "Jamie Carragher says if Mac Allister can get back to his best then Liverpool will too - but he was off the pace again here. Clattered by Van Dijk in the build-up to United's goal and needed treatment. Then had little impact in the first half before sparking a counter and shooting over in the second. Subbed off on the hour.",
      "Dominik Szoboszlai - 7",
      "Hit some fine long-range passes but it was his incisive forward balls through the middle of the pitch which got Liverpool moving forwards. His 100 per cent passing accuracy at the break dipped in the second half but continued to contribute defensively and offensively when shifted to right-back.",
      "Mohamed Salah - 5",
      "The most goal involvements of any player in Premier League history in this fixture - but he's miles away from his stratospheric levels of the past right now. Shot horribly wide when he looked set to score in the second half after fluffing a volley from a corner. There was a brilliant pass into Gakpo earlier but a combination of positioning and form has blunted his threat. Hooked with Liverpool needing a goal at 2-1 and that said it all.",
      "Alexander Isak - 5",
      "Arne Slot said his British-record £125m striker is ready to start firing now - not on this evidence. The big chance came in the first half when Isak fired his one-on-one chance at Senne Lammens. He snatched another shot wide from distance and saw an ambitious effort blocked away by Luke Shaw later. Not what Liverpool paid the big bucks for.",
      "Cody Gakpo - 7",
      "Scored one equaliser. Should have scored another, heading wastefully wide after tapping in for 1-1. Earlier was involved as Liverpool hit the woodwork not once, not twice but THREE times, with a deflected cross sandwiching two blasts against posts. Liverpool's most dangerous attacker but will leave Anfield kicking himself for that miss.",
      "Subs",
      "Hugo Ekitike - 6",
      "Lost his place to Isak and came on looking like a man with a point to prove, firing just wide not long after his introduction before missing the target with another dig.",
      "Florian Wirtz - 6",
      "A little pass to Federico Chiesa allowed the Italian to tee up Gakpo for the equaliser. That was some encouragement for the £116m man who had been benched again and has seen his run of no goals or assists in the Premier League go on. But he remains a big dilemma for Slot.",
      "Curtis Jones - 6",
      "Tried to add energy to Liverpool's forward play and fired a shot on target but couldn't come up with a moment of magic in a fixture he'd love to win more than most.",
      "Federico Chiesa - 6",
      "Another big Anfield moment for Chiesa this season to cross for Gakpo to thump in the leveller - but this time his late intervention didn't earn Liverpool points.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong - 6",
      "Another high-profile summer signing who started on the bench but should have had an assist when he nipped to the byline and crossed for Gakpo. His long-term role in this team still uncertain.",
      "Senne Lammens - 7",
      "Held his own in a hostile environment in his second Premier League start. Big save with his leg to deny Isak in the first half. One of five saves he made. Little he could do for the equaliser. Continued to look confident claiming crosses and brought calm to the defence.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt - 6",
      "Lost Gakpo for Liverpool's equaliser and headed over from close range with his side 2-1 up. It didn't matter in the end.",
      "Harry Maguire - 8",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and scored the winner at Anfield. He missed a chance to win the game in the same fixture last season but made no mistake this time with his head. The hero for his team once again.",
      "Luke Shaw - 6",
      "Timid defending showed Gakpo inside when he struck the post soon after the restart. Isak stuck to him in the hope of finding joy but only really got free once when Lammens denied him.",
      "Amad Diallo - 8",
      "Perfectly weighted through ball for the opener. Ran Kerkez ragged down the right as he finally clicked with Bryan Mbeumo. Undoubtedly their best game playing together. His team lost something when he was taken off.",
      "Casemiro - 6",
      "Lasted nearly an hour and put in a decent shift as the deepest midfielder after a quick turnaround from international duty playing in South Korea and Japan. The 33-year-old was unremarkable but did a job which is good going after playing two full games for Brazil.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 8",
      "Covered every blade of grass and looked exhausted late in the second half but had enough in the tank to produce a stunning volleyed assist for the winner. Should probably score to make it 2-0 in the first half, but more than made up for it in the end.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 5",
      "Nervous performance at left wing-back. His poor pass high up led to Liverpool's counter when Gakpo struck the post.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo - 8",
      "Good finish for the opener to set his team up perfectly in a hostile environment. His influence waned in the second half but he set his team on their path to victory. Always a threat cutting in.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Did a defensive job for his head coach as the false nine. Struggled to influence the game much in an attacking sense. Forced one save and could have scored to make it 2-0 if he had anticipated the ball bouncing for him in the box.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 7",
      "Brought in as one of two changes and caused Liverpool problems in the first half starting on the left of a front three that was fluid in possession. Was less effective offensively after the break when his team dropped deeper but never shied away from taking the ball.",
      "Subs",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Replaced Casemiro after nearly an hour but had little impact on the game. Made an important block deep in stoppage time to stop a Liverpool cross into the six-yard box. His best moment.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 5",
      "Nervous when he came on to replace Amad. Beaten by Ekitike twice in the lead-up to the equaliser and then could not block Chiesa's cross. Too easily beaten.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 6",
      "Replaced Mount after an hour and had a limited role. Best chance was a through ball over the top that he took down nicely only to be ruled offside. Played a nice ball in to Cunha that came to nothing.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - N/A",
      "Replaced Fernandes with five minutes to go and touched the ball just twice.",
      "Leny Yoro - N/A",
      "Replaced Shaw with five minutes to go and did not have enough time to impact the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
