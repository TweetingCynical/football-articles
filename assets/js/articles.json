      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is seriously considering leaving the club tis summer, it has been claimed. The Portugal midfielder has been the subject of interest from Saudi club Al Hilal, with a mega-money offer said to be on the table.",
      "Fernandes, who has been with United since 2020, has been targeted by Al Hilal after his current club failed to qualify for the Champions League. The Saudi Pro League outfit are ready to offer a £100million transfer fee, as well as a huge £200m contract to the former Sporting CP star.",
      "The player's agent met with the potential suitors earlier this week, with exit talks reported to have run late into the night. Al Hilal, who are due to take part in this summer's Club World Cup, are said to have set a tight deadline on Fernandes' decision.",
      "According to various sources, United themselves are 'relaxed' about the situation. A £100m bid would represent a significant profit on their star man, while freeing up funds to reinvest in the squad after a Europa League final defeat ensured Ruben Amorim's side won't take part in European competition next term.",
      "Fernandes has been away with United's squad on a post-season tour, playing in a shock defeat to ASEAN All Stars in Malaysia on Wednesday. They have another match against Hong Kong on Friday, and head coach Amorim spoke of his captain's importance before the first of the two friendlies.",
      "“He's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team,\" Amorim said. “We talk about this many times.",
      "\"You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership. You can see the passion he has for the game. In difficult moments Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.”",
      "Speaking after the Europa League final defeat, Fernandes appeared to open the door to an exit. \"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is,\" he said.",
      "\"Football sometimes is like this. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.",
      "\"I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club to the great days. The day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way.\"",

      "Delap has become one of the hottest properties in the Premier League after netting 12 goals for the Tractor Boys in the 2024-25 campaign, though he couldn't prevent their relegation to the second tier.",
      "The 22-year-old is eager to stay in the top flight and is assessing his next move, with David Moyes revealing he had spoken to \"three or four clubs\" - including his Everton side.",
      "United had been strongly linked with Delap and hoped that winning the Europa League could strengthen their position by securing Champions League football. They went on to lose the final 1-0 to Tottenham to round off a miserable season that saw them finish in 15th place.",

      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform better, to prepare better for games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he said. \"So I think it’s a good thing for us to take advantage not to have European games.\"",
      "But those words have now backfired after missing out on Delap, who sees playing in the Champions League as one of the main attractions of joining Chelsea - according to the i Paper.",
      "Delap has also been swayed by the likelihood of regular game time after noticing the lack of options up front alongside Nicolas Jackson, the report goes on.",
      "The player's mind has been made up, it claims, despite United officials being optimistic they were still an alluring option without any European football on the table.",
      "Chelsea are planning to activate his release clause in the coming days before finalising personal terms.",
      "It will come as a huge blow to Amorim, who is eager to bolster his front line after watching Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee score just seven goals between them in the Premier League.",
      "Other targets being linked with Old Trafford are Amorim's former Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, though the Sweden international is also likely to be put off without European football on the table, while Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is also rumoured to be of interest.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy's managerial tenure at Leicester City is hanging in the balance as he seeks clarity over his future. It is a strikingly similar situation to the one the Dutchman experienced at PSV Eindhoven, where he quit after telling players and staff he no longer felt “supported” by the club.",
      "History could very much repeat itself for the Foxes boss, who is still yet to receive any indication whether he will be kept on by the club going into next season. Leicester ended a dismal campaign with a 2-0 loss to Bournemouth last weekend as they fell back into the Championship.",
      "But current boss Van Nistelrooy says he is unable to plan for next season in the second tier and make signings because he hasn’t had a conversation with the board about the club’s plans. The 48-year-old said recently that whether he remains in charge “depends on how the conversations go”.",
      "And when quizzed about his plans for the upcoming season, Van Nistelrooy confessed: “I still have to wait at least to have a conversation on a future together or not. Before that, you cannot start planning. I need to speak to be able to get a feeling on hopes. It’s all dependent on that.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s state of limbo has fuelled speculation that he may be replaced by Russell Martin, formerly of Southampton, as the Foxes look for a manager with a prior history of clinching promotion to the Premier League.",
      "Van Nistelrooy has endured a disastrous tenure since replacing Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in late November, which saw their relegation to the Championship confirmed in April.",
      "The Foxes were one point clear of the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but a dreadful run of form followed, which saw them lose a whopping 16 games from 18 played between December and February.",
      "And it’s not the first time Van Nistelrooy has found himself at odds with club bosses. The Manchester United legend quit his old job as PSV boss in May 2023 over a lack of support from the Dutch giants just a year after taking charge of the senior side.",
      "It came as somewhat of a surprise, given that he'd won a Johan Cruyff Shield and a TOTO KNVB Beker, while also looking set to finish in second place in the Eredivisie.",
      "PSV at the time alluded to his falling out with the board, releasing a statement, which read: \"Van Nistelrooy told the first-team squad and coaching staff that he would be stepping down with immediate effect, due to a lack of support within the club.",
      "\"PSV regrets his decision and is grateful to him for winning the Johan Cruijff Shield and the Dutch Cup, and hopes to finish the season in second place.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s next job came when he was appointed as Erik ten Hag's assistant ahead of the 2024/25 season. After a poor start to the campaign led to Ten Hag's dismissal, Van Nistelrooy took over in an interim capacity.",
      "The former Netherlands striker, however, was left feeling \"disappointed\" and \"hurt\" after being told to pack his bags by United's incoming boss, Ruben Amorim, who brought his own backroom team with him.",
      "Meanwhile, Van Nistelrooy’s potential successor, Martin, was sacked by the Saints in December and just 16 games into the Premier League season, having overseen an astonishing 13 defeats. Martin has also been touted for the vacant managerial position at Rangers.",

      "Few forwards are in as high demand as Viktor Gyokeres this summer, and Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson is all too aware of that fact. But the surge of interest in his team's top talisman means he's ready to break his usual habit of advising the player on his transfer.",
      "Among the interested parties are Premier League heavyweights like Arsenal and Manchester United. Correio da Manha reported the Gunners flew a contingent to Portugal for talks with the player's agent this week, while a move to Old Trafford would see Gyokeres reunite with former Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Tomasson has admitted he usually likes to give players input on where to move, whether that be to benefit them in terms of playing time or stylistically. But the media circus that's erupted around Gyokeres has convinced him to remain out of the equation, at least in public.",
      "The former Blackburn boss, who took charge of Sweden's national team in 2024, has more of an inside scoop on the matter than most. But the 48-year-old was unwilling when asked if he would divulge whether he has a preference in where Gyokeres moves.",
      "\"No, of course not,\" he said while speaking to Swedish outlet Aftonbladet from the national team's training ground. \"Because then it would be blown up like this [stretches arms].\"",
      "Like most national team coaches, Tomasson said he prefers to select players who are getting regular minutes for their respective clubs. He added that he regularly speaks to his players about \"what would be a good and bad club,\" but it appears an exception will be made in Gyokeres' case, unless he reaches out for advice.",
      "\"There are definitely players changing clubs! We know that each year,\" he continued. \"If you look at each player, you need to make the right choice.",
      "\"You actually don't know if it's the right choice before you're at the club. You have family as well you have to have in mind. It's not easy, but at the end of the day, that's [football].\"",
      "Gyokeres, who turns 27 on Wednesday, is arguably the form frontman in Europe after scoring 97 goals in 102 outings for Sporting. And those in his inner circle have been unabashed in admitting they want him to remain in Lisbon.",
      "The player's uncle, Chris, revealed his nephew's summer prospects were a hot topic of discussion at a recent family dinner. And he left no doubt as to where he'd like to see the former Coventry talent end up next season.",
      "\"Yes, very much,\" he told Sport.TV, when asked if he and the family felt connected to Lisbon. \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "It was during the recent celebrations at the Taca de Portugal final that Gyokeres' girlfriend also gave her take on the situation. And actress Ines Aguiar was quoted saying she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to stay at Sporting for a third campaign."

Saudi sources have reportedly told Fernandes that the offer is a one-time opportunity, with other suggesting that he is 'seriously considering' a move - albeit he remains relaxed about the situation.",
      "They have offered to raise his wages to an eye-watering £700k per week, while he could earn around £200m over the duration of a three-year deal. And they would also be willing to pay United £100m to prise away their captain.",

      "For years, Wesley Sneijder was the Premier League's elusive phantom. The Inter Milan and Netherlands icon was perpetually linked with moves to England, with Manchester United, Liverpool and others investing serious time and effort in pursuit of the mercurial midfielder.",
      "In his prime, Sneijder was a creative force in world football, with his sublime blend of technical brilliance and lethal goalscoring instinct captivating clubs across Europe. Fresh off orchestrating Inter Milan's historic 2010 Treble and steering the Netherlands to a World Cup final, he was the prize many elite clubs coveted.",
      "\"At that time, I was considering both. But when you look at my career, all the teams I have played for were playing for something, playing for the title, always in the top three of the league.",
      "\"And at that time, Liverpool were not as great as they are now. Galatasaray was a completely new experience. A different culture, and playing for prizes. So I chose them over Liverpool.\"",
      "His decision nearly haunted him, as the Reds mounted a thrilling, albeit doomed, Premier League title charge in 2013/14 under Brendan Rodgers, derailed by Steven Gerrard's infamous slip against Chelsea. In Istanbul, Sneijder's gamble paid dividends, as he powered Galatasaray to eight major trophies, including two Super Lig titles and three Turkish Cups. Yet, the siren call of the Premier League lingered.",
      "Reflecting on the Manchester United saga, Sneijder revealed that talks with the Red Devils were gaining momentum in 2010, only to collapse abruptly. It wasn't until years later, during a chance encounter between his father and legendary former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, that the truth behind the failed transfer emerged, shedding light on one of modern football's great 'what-ifs.'",
      "\"I didn't know the reason - I didn't ask my agent. He just said they [United] didn't call anymore and I believed it. But many years later, like five or six years later, my father was in Manchester with a friend of his, and they walked into a place where Sir Alex Ferguson was.",
      "\"And he spoke to my father and he said he was interested in me, that he wanted to sign me, but that there was a problem with the agent. So that was the problem - which I didn't know before. That's the information I have now.",
      "\"Obviously, it would have been a great move. After winning everything to go to a big club like Man United would have been amazing. But also, I had a great time at Inter Milan, and after that I had a great move to Galatasaray... it just didn't happen.\"",
      "Sneijder, now 40, launched his storied career at Ajax, honing his craft before a high-profile 2007 transfer to Real Madrid. In his debut season, he clinched the La Liga title, but the arrival of the second Galacticos era - headlined by Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, and Karim Benzema - pushed him out in 2009.",
      "Revenge came swiftly, though, as Sneijder, under Jose Mourinho, helped new club Inter clinch a famous Treble, capped by a 2-0 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich at the Bernabeu - his former home. After securing six major titles in three-and-a-half years at the San Siro, he joined Galatasaray, before stints at Nice and Qatari outfit Al-Gharafa.",
      "Internationally, Sneijder's 134 caps - a Dutch record - saw him shine at six major tournaments. His pinnacle came at the 2010 World Cup, where he led the Netherlands to the final, claimed joint-top scorer honours, and earned the Silver Ball as the tournament's second-best player.",
      "Sneijder's career, defined by trophies as well as near-misses, remains a testament to his unwavering pursuit of glory over glamour. While the Premier League's allure never truly faded, his choice to chase success in the fervent footballing cauldrons of Milan and Istanbul over England's uncertain promises proved his instinct for winning was as sharp as his playmaking."

      "It is understood that what Amad took offense to wasn't racist, but rather that fans were shouting \"Diallo\" at him. The Ivory Coast international has previously requested to be known solely by his first name, following some controversy involving a trafficking case from his time at previous club Atalanta.",
      "Amad was fined £42,000 by the Italian FA in 2021 after an investigation into allegations he used false documents and fake parents to get into Italy. United signed him for an initial fee of £19million - which could rise to £37m - from Atalanta in January 2021 and, after a successful loan spell at Sunderland, he has become a regular first-team player.",
      "He will be involved when United play Hong Kong in the second of their post-season tour games, which have been embarked upon to earn the struggling club around £7.8m.",
      "Having used 25 outfield players in the embarrassing loss in Malaysia, Ruben Amorim will again rotate his team against Hong Kong, albeit without Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot and Andre Onana, who have flown on to a fan engagement event in India.",
      "United did not shy away from the Amad incident in Kuala Lumpur, having put him up for the press conference in Hong Kong, where he fielded questions about his close friend Alejandro Garnacho, who is expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "“Alejandro is a really good player and we need good players in the team,” Amad told reporters when asked if he hoped Garnacho might stay. “I know Garna really well, so I hope to have Garna next season. It is not really a big issue for the team. Everything is good now.\"",
      "Speaking about his plans for the Hong Kong match, Amorim said: “I will try to divide because I don’t want all the young kids all together. I will try to mix these things. We want to be competitive. If they are fit, they will play, and we will have the maximum respect for everybody here and for our fans.”",

Garnacho is on United’s post-season tour, despite being poised to leave after Amorim told him that he doesn’t feature in his plans for next season.",
      "It is an awkward situation for both player and manager following a falling out that will lead to Garnacho’s departure in the summer transfer window. United are ready to listen to offers for any of their squad following a desperate season, in which they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho is at the top of the list to sell after reacting badly to being left on the bench for the final against Spurs. He was then left out of the squad for United’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa on the final day of the season and is ready to quit United once the transfer window opens, with Napoli the frontrunners for his signature.",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim took the 20-year-old winger on United’s tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong, where he has cut the figure of a moody teenager, reluctantly signing autographs before playing in the embarrassing 1-0 defeat by ASEAN All-Stars on Wednesday.",
      "His exit appears as good as inevitable – and Amorim’s reaction after hearing Amad posed a question about Garnacho in a press conference in Hong Kong summed up the mood. While the reporter asked the United forward if he hoped his friend would stay for the 2025/26 campaign, Amorim was spotted trying to stifle a laugh with his hand.",
      "Amad then answered: \"Alejandro is a really good player and we need good players in the team. I know Garna really well, so I hope to have Garna next season. It is not really a big issue for the team. Everything is good now.\"",
      "Amorim has been unhappy with Garnacho’s attitude in recent weeks and is more than happy to sanction his exit. United rejected a £40million bid from Napoli in January for the Argentina international, but will hold talks with the Italian champions’ sporting director Giovanni Manna once they return from Hong Kong.",
      "The United boss batted away suggestions that it was odd he would bring Garnacho on the trip, given his status. “It is not a surprise,” he said. “He is a player of Manchester United – all the players are here. Some players are injured and it was better for them not to fly here to play these two games. It is a normal situation.\"",
      "United are desperate to generate funds for their summer overhaul and Garnacho is on the transfer list along with Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho following their loan spells at other clubs.

      "Alan Shearer has expressed worries about the \"rows\" between Manchester United and Wolves concerning Matheus Cunha's potential transfer to Old Trafford. It's been indicated for some time that the Brazil international will be joining United, but recent hiccups have emerged that could jeopardise the move.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been braced to enter his first summer transfer window at the United helm with limited resources. And funding is sure to suffer further after their defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final, leaving the club with no European football next season.",
      "United now need to sell certain players before they can afford to spend any significant sums. And Newcastle legend Shearer raised doubts regarding United's prospects of securing Cunha amid recent developments.",
      "\"Who they sell, I don't know. If they need to raise funds then they have a couple of options to do that,\" he told Betfair. \"It looks as if the Cunha deal is going to happen albeit I saw that there's rows in terms of how payments will be made.\"",
      "The transfer saga seems to have taken a positive turn after United agreed to shell out the £62.5m fee in three payments spread over two years. Cunha is now poised to have his medical at Carrington, potentially marking United's most significant acquisition of 2025.",
      "The former RB Leipzig and Atletico Madrid attacker has an impressive record of 33 goals in 92 games for Wolves and offers much-needed versatility up top. Meanwhile, Shearer has cautioned that there's still a hefty amount of squad rebuilding necessary before United can dream of fighting for a top-six finish again.",
      "He continued: \"Man United need an overhaul but it won't happen in one or two transfer windows and that's why, as a player, you have to think long and hard about needing or wanting to go there because it's going to take two or three years to get anywhere near the levels to challenge for the top six again.",
      "\"If funds are going to be tight due to PSR then their assets in [Alejandro] Garnacho and [Bruno] Fernandes may have to be sold to bring funds in. Nothing surprises me with Man United on or off the field anymore because they've been an embarrassment over the last 12 months.\"",
      "Cunha himself has dropped a big hint he's preparing to leave after seemingly bidding farewell to his Wolves supporters. The club's official Instagram account featured a clip of the Molineux faithful serenading the star following their last game of the campaign, and Cunha’s response seemed to indicate plans for departure.",
      "\"I can't thank you enough for so much,\" he wrote in the comments section. And many have interpreted his words as an indication his tenure in the midlands is nearing its conclusion.",
      "Garnacho, 20, has been placed on the transfer list following a fallout with Amorim, who excluded him from the squad that beat Aston Villa on the final day of the season. There's talk United are aiming to bag up to £70m for the youngster, although their negotiating stance seems frail.",
      "United will undoubtedly be keener to cling on to captain Fernandes, who was previously rumoured to be on the radars of Barcelona and Real Madrid. Meanwhile, a move to Saudi Arabia now appears to be the most probable outcome if he were to depart."

      "Manchester United’s failure to sign their 'top target' Florian Wirtz is set to come back to haunt them as Liverpool close in on the German sensation. Liverpool are currently in talks with Bayer Leverkusen after convincing Wirtz and his representatives that his future lies in Merseyside.",
      "The 22-year-old's family recently flew to Liverpool to look at houses in the north west of England, having been impressed with Arne Slot’s vision for him and the Premier League winners going forward.",
      "The Reds have since submitted an opening bid of £85million plus add-ons for the Germany international after receiving the green light from owners Fenway Sports Group. That sum falls short of Leverkusen’s valuation of the player, with the German side understood to be holding out for a deal that would break the Premier League transfer record, set by Chelsea’s £115m move for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "Yet, Wirtz’s preference to join Liverpool over Bayern Munich means the Premier League champions are very much the frontrunners in the race to secure their long-term target’s signature, with negotiations between the two clubs continuing and an agreement likely very soon.",
      "Such news will be particularly poorly received in certain Manchester circles after they passed up the opportunity to sign him three-and-a-half years ago.",
      "During Ralf Rangnick’s brief spell in charge at Old Trafford, the then-interim manager compiled a lengthy list of his top transfer targets for the United hierarchy to bring in.",
      "Rangnick was appointed in December 2021 and was expected to start a two-year consultancy gig once a permanent successor was identified at the end of the season. Ahead of his first transfer window at the helm in January 2022, his wishlist included the likes of Josko Gvardiol, Christopher Nkunku and Erling Haaland.",
      "But an 18-year-old Wirtz was the German’s priority target. Wirtz at the time was enjoying a meteoric rise at Leverkusen, becoming the club’s youngest ever player in the Bundesliga with his debut coming shortly after his 17th birthday in March 2020. With eight goals and eight assists the following season, he earned a call-up to the senior Germany squad in March 2021.",
      "Rangnick had hoped the draw of the Premier League and Old Trafford could persuade Wirtz to join United. Reports claimed a transfer fee of £60m would have been sufficient to convince Leverkusen to part ways.",
      "United, however, opted against making any signings in January 2022, much to the frustration of Rangnick. And the interim boss left the club in May after winning just 11 of his 31 games, ending the Red Devils’ pursuit of Wirtz.",
      "Since then, the attacking-midfielder has gone on to become one of European football’s brightest talents thanks to his performances under Xabi Alonso. He played a pivotal role as Leverkusen completed an unbeaten domestic double last season, which put him on the radar of clubs like Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Chelsea.",
      "Newly-crowned German champions Bayern were quietly confident that they could complete a deal this summer for Wirtz, who is under contract with Leverkusen until 2027. However, that fell apart after Wirtz and his parents – who represent him in negotiations – met with Bayern chief Max Eberl, club supremo Uli Hoeness and head coach Vincent Kompany.",
      "It is understood that they left the meeting feeling underwhelmed and with a lack of clarity around Bayern's plans for him. The opposite happened when they met with Liverpool, who impressed due to a depth of knowledge around Wirtz, allowing them to push ahead in the queue.",
      "Leverkusen’s managing director Simon Rolfes this week confirmed that Liverpool hold “concrete interest” in him. \"[Wirtz is] one of our players,\" Rolfes said at the press conference to unveil new head coach Erik ten Hag on Monday. \"Naturally, there’s a lot of interest. There’s concrete interest from Liverpool but there’s no more to say right now. Florian is our player.”",
      "The blockbuster deal for Wirtz is just one part of Liverpool’s plans for the summer transfer window, with his Leverkusen team-mate Jeremie Frimpong also heading for Anfield in a £29.5m deal, while Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez is also of interest. Their potential arrivals is clear evidence of the pulling power of winning, with Slot able to convince players following his Premier League title victory.",
      "On the plus side for United and Ruben Amorim, they are edging close to completing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m, with a medical on the way for the Brazilian attacker.",

That’s the opinion of former United midfielder Gordon Strachan, who has urged the club to sell Garnacho at the earliest opportunity in the summer transfer window.",

United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham and will undergo a major squad overhaul in the coming months.",

I think he shows a lack of maturity and needs a real wake-up call. Manchester United is far too good of a club to listen to him whingeing and whining all the time,” he told Esports Insider.",

He has attracted plenty of interest, with David Moyes admitting last week that Delap had “spoken to three or four clubs”, including Everton.",

      "Maresca coached Delap during his time in Manchester City's academy, while Shields played a role in sealing Delap's move from Derby to join City's academy in 2019. That has led to Delap giving the Blues a green light over the deal.",

      "Manchester United have a huge summer ahead of them after what has been a tragic season. The Red Devils finished a lowly 15th in the Premier League having lost 18 games throughout the campaign.",
      "They also failed to seal an unlikely return to the Champions League as they lost out to Tottenham in the Europa League final earlier this month. That looked set to be a huge blow to United’s hopes of a huge rebuild this summer.",
      "But that might be slightly premature, with club chiefs already putting lofty plans in place for the upcoming summer transfer window. United could choose to spend heavily to bolster their side over the coming months, with a series of lucrative signings potentially in the pipeline.",
      "So, what could Ruben Amorim’s side look like on the first day of next season?",
      "Starting in goal, there’s a debate over the future of Andre Onana. The Cameroon goalkeeper has been blighted by a series of errors since his big-money arrival from Inter Milan. And United could look to move him on amid interest from Saudi and raid relegated Leicester for Mads Hermansen. The Dane has shone during the past two seasons in the Midlands and could potentially be available for around £35m.",
      "Moving into defence, the Red Devils look pretty well set. They spent huge fees on Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt last summer and the pair look set to be a key part of the defence.",
      "The same could also be said of Lisandro Martinez, who looks likely to recover from the serious knee injury he picked up earlier this season. Patrick Dorgu should also remain in the side despite a slow start to life at Old Trafford. A number of defenders could consequently leave the club including Tyrell Malacia, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof - the latter two having already confirmed their departures.",
      "Midfield could however look very different come next season. Atalanta midfielder Ederson has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, with Liverpool among those interested. United could muscle in on their rivals’ interest but it won’t be cheap with the Serie A side having put a £63m price tag on the Brazilian. Manuel Ugarte looks set to be a key player under Ruben Amorim - particularly in games where that greater level of midfield graft, rather than craft, is required, after acclimatising to life in the Premier League.",
      "Who should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below",
      "But question marks remain over Casemiro, despite his impressive displays towards the end of the season. Regarding other midfield exits, Christian Eriksen has already departed, while the future of Kobbie Mainoo remains up in the air. Bruno Fernandes could also be among those to leave - albeit Amorim and United chiefs will be desperate to keep the Portuguese playmaker amid serious interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "United’s season this term really stumbled due to their lack of goal threat and that could see the club completely transform their frontline. On-loan stars Antony, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho could all be sold permanently.",
      "They could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee in leaving. The first attacking signing of the new era looks set to be Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who will likely put pen to paper at Old Trafford after United activated a £62.5m release clause in his deal.",
      "He could also be joined by fellow Premier League star Bryan Mbeumo. Reports have suggested that the Red Devils have opened talks for a £50m deal for the 20-goal forward but they could face competition from Newcastle.",
      "Finally, a new central striker could be on the agenda for United. Liam Delap is among the targets, albeit Chelsea look to be moving ahead in the race for the Ipswich star.",
      "That could potentially see United move their crosshairs to Victor Osimhen, who has spent the past season with Turkish side Galatasaray. And he could be available for as little as £51m this summer. He would be the ideal replacement to solve the club’s goalscoring issue following another brilliant campaign.",
      "Potential Man United XI: Hermansen; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Dalot, Ederson, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "It never looked like a good idea, but it is turning out to be much worse than expected.",
      "After concluding their miserable 2024-25 season, Manchester United flew over 6,600 miles to Kuala Lumpur for marketing reasons. Having deemed 60 largely disappointing matches inadequate, United’s brains trust signed their demoralised squad up for two more.",
      "“Importantly, tour fixtures drive significant additional revenue which help make the club stronger, allowing us to keep investing in success on the pitch,” chief executive Omar Berrada said plainly when the club announced the genius plan in early April.",
      "Back then, there must have already been nagging worries that United’s decision-makers were signing their club up for another dose of embarrassment. All for the estimated revenue of $10million (£7.8m) the trip will make for United.",
      "This is the reality of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era : a penny-pinching petrochemicals billionaire. A man worth $16.7bn (£12.4bn), according to Forbes, making hundreds of staff redundant and sending his exhausted players halfway across the world to appease sponsors and spread the good word of United.",
      "That £7.8m is suddenly looking like a bad deal. The malaise that engulfed the club this season became even darker and thicker with the 1-0 defeat by Tottenham in the Europa League final and has now become a pervasive presence; an unwanted 12th man on the pitch.",
      "Videos of Alejandro Garnacho half-heartedly signing autographs and other players trudging heads down past screaming fans were bad enough before the actual football – ostensibly the reason for their visit – was taken into account.",
      "United somehow managed to lose 1-0 to the ASEAN All Stars in Bukit Jalil National Stadium on Wednesday. Ruben Amorim used 25 outfield players, but was powerless to stop Maung Maung Lwin – a Burmese player who plies his trade in the Thai League – from providing the game’s only goal.",
      "Many of the 84,000 people who turned up in the Malaysian capital, some of whom had paid £260 for a ticket, booed them off the pitch. In a season of crushing lows, United had somehow managed to plumb new depths. This was embarrassing – and it is obvious who was to blame.",
      "United have set their players up for failure with this ridiculous money-grabbing PR disaster. Even if they had enjoyed a good domestic campaign, or if they had beaten Spurs in Bilbao, the players would not have been up for this trip. There is a reason this is the first time United have embarked on a post-season tour.",
      "This one is only a few days old and it is already backfiring in potentially spectacular fashion. While Matheus Cunha is too far down the line to change his mind over a £62.5m transfer from Wolves to United, other targets are not. United better hope they are enjoying their holiday so much that they haven’t bothered opening social media or reading the newspapers.",
      "Because does anyone really want to join this mess? They are a rubbish football team right now, but more than that, they are a miserable and disunited bunch. They will become a revolving door this summer, shipping out scores of players while scrabbling around for anyone who will join them. They won’t play any European football next season and Carrington is reportedly a vibe vacuum, having had the life sucked out of it by Ratcliffe’s staff purge.",
      "This is the context which players like Liam Delap must currently be assessing. Delap is poised to leave Ipswich for £30m this summer. He is understood to be choosing between United and Chelsea – a decision which currently looks extremely straightforward.",
      "While United ended the season as a representation of the “This is fine” meme, everything burning around them, Chelsea did so with a European trophy and a place in next season’s Champions League secured.",
      "Ratcliffe has frequently, and in public, lamented the way things were done at United. He has made decisions he deems unpopular but necessary. But what he seems to fail to understand is that perception matters. Yes, he may have succeeded in putting the club on a more even footing financially, but at what cost?",
      "This ludicrous post-season tour is a perfect example of the Ratcliffe era so far: commercially astute yet visually unappealing. It could be extremely damaging to the planned squad overhaul this summer.",

      "\"I was very disappointed with his game, I was expecting something more creative and dangerous. Unfortunately for Betis we didn’t see the Antony who has been good during his loan. That guy has to avoid English football, that’s it. Don’t play against English teams and don’t play for any football club in England because it doesn’t suit him.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim says the situation with Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho is \"okay\" despite telling the winger he is free to leave the club.",
      "Amorim told Garnacho he could leave United after the Argentine criticised the United head coach's decision to put him on the bench for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last week.",
      "Garnacho was dropped from the United squad for their final game of the Premier League season against Aston Villa on Sunday but he was then included in the travelling squad for their post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong.",
      "The 20-year-old played in the second half of United's 1-0 defeat to the ASEAN All Stars on Wednesday night and Garnacho is expected to feature again against a Hong Kong XI on Friday.",
      "\"It’s not a surprise,\" Amorim said of Garnacho's presence in Asia. \"He’s a player of Manchester United, all the players are here. Some players are injured and it was better not to fly here to play these two games so it’s a normal situation. It’s okay.\"",
      "There was anger in Hong Kong last year when Lionel Messi did not participate in an exhibition match between Inter Miami and the national team. Chinese officials cancelled two Argentina friendlies that were scheduled for March 2024 in retaliation over Messi's absence and the fallout dragged on for weeks.",
      "Amorim has promised to give all of the United players game time against Hong Kong. \"Yes, I heard that,\" he said of the Messi affair. \"If they are fit, they will play. We will have the maximum respect for everybody here. We are going to address that.",
      "\"I will think about that when I choose the players to play. We want to use all the young players. We want to balance the team.\"",
      "United were booed by fans in Kuala Lumpur after they lost and failed to score a week on from losing to Spurs by the same scoreline in Bilbao.",
      "Amorim has been in charge of United for more than six months and assumed additional responsibilities due to the prestige of the role. The Hong Kong manager Ashley Westwood said United need a post-season tour \"like a hole in the head\" but Amorim insists United should front up to their domestic and overseas supporters.",
      "\"I think everybody understands that it is a really hard context because we have the season that we have and it is hard in these moments even to face the fans around the world,\" Amorim admitted. \"It is a moment that is hard for us and we want to finish the season.",
      "\"But at the same time we want to give something to the fans. Of course, it is hard to play these games. We have one tour that we are travelling. We don't have time to adapt. Sometimes we are here and we don't have so much time to have contact with the fans to give everything that they deserve.",
      "\"But I think it is clear. We cannot hide that it is really tough in this moment for us not to close the season. But again, if there is one thing that is really important in this club it is that we need to face our fans in this moment and we need to give something to our fans around the world.",
      "\"We want to do that, but sometimes it is really hard for us. Amad is trying to explain, but we were not really focused in the last game and everybody can feel it.",
      "\"But in that moment I understand the fans, I understand the players and we also understand that we want to give something to the fans, but it is hard in this moment. We just want to turn the page.\""

      "Manchester United are set to miss out on the signing of Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap amid his preference to join Chelsea.",
      "United had identified the 22-year-old as an attainable target to strengthen their attacking options ahead of next season after Ipswich's relegation triggered a £30million release clause in his contract.",
      "The former Manchester City youngster, as well as being the subject of interest from United and Chelsea, has also held talks with Everton and Newcastle United recently. He scored 12 Premier League goals this season.",
      "With United now set to miss out on the former Stoke City and Hull City loanee, MEN Sport has picked out five alternatives who the Reds could potentially consider to spearhead their attack.",
      "United have been linked with Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo this week, but news of Delap's expected switch to Stamford Bridge could force the Reds to target one of his teammates instead.",
      "Wissa, 28, scored 19 Premier League goals this season, successfully filling the void that had been vacated by Ivan Toney last summer. He led Brentford's attack throughout the season and was only outscored by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23), Erling Haaland (22), Chris Wood (20) and Mbeumo (20) in the Premier League.",
      "The former FC Lorient man also scored 12 times in the Premier League last season, meaning his tally of 32 over the last two seasons means he has netted more top flight goals in that period than Mbeumo, who so often dominates the Brentford headlines.",
      "Establishing himself as a consistent source of goals in the Premier League, Wissa is likely to be a target for a lot of clubs this summer. His contract at the Gtech Community Stadium is up in 2026, but Brentford have the option of an additional year, which they would almost certainly trigger to protect his soaring valuation.",
      "Like Wissa, Mateta is another striker who exceeded expectations for one of the Premier League's mid-table clubs this season, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, of which 14 were netted in the league.",
      "Since initially arriving at Selhurst Park on loan in January 2021, the Frenchman's all-round game has improved, and that has been reflected in his increased attacking output. After scoring 16 goals in the Premier League last season, his tally of 14 this time around demonstrates that he is now an established goal-getter.",
      "Under contract at Palace until 2027, Mateta is excellent at holding the ball up and bringing others into play, meaning he could be an ideal fit for Ruben Amorim's team, where the two No.10s are tasked with operating close to the central striker.",
      "If United decide that Mateta is a realistic alternative to Delap, the problem they could face is that Palace have European football to offer the striker next season after qualifying for the Europa League via their FA Cup triumph at Wembley earlier this month. Being unable to offer European football at Old Trafford could hold United back in their search for a striker.",
      "Strikers of David's pedigree do not come on the market all that often. The fact he is available for free this summer after deciding to leave Lille means that he will be a very attractive option for a number of clubs.",
      "The Canadian spent five years at Lille, scoring 109 goals in 232 appearances, establishing himself as one of Europe's most consistent goalscorers. United have been heavily linked with him in the past and he would be an excellent signing on a free transfer.",
      "However, David played in the Champions League this season and scored seven goals in ten appearances, meaning he will have aspirations of playing in the competition again next season. The likes of Liverpool, Newcastle and Barcelona have all been linked with him and will each play in the Champions League in 2025/26.",
      "It means United are highly unlikely to be able to lure David to M16, even though he would not require a transfer fee. It is when you look at players of his ilk that you begin to grasp a real understanding of just how costly failing to qualify for the Champions League could be.",
      "United have been linked with Osimhen countless times in previous years and now would be as good a time as any to bring him to Old Trafford. He will leave Napoli this summer on a permanent basis after falling out with head coach Antonio Conte almost a year ago.",
      "He spent this season on loan at Turkish side Galatasaray and scored a whopping 36 goals in 40 matches across all competitions. He also racked up eight assists.",
      "Already being linked with Saudi Arabian outfit Al-Hilal, United may face a race against the clock to try and lure him to Old Trafford. Some reports have claimed he could be available for around €40m.",
      "In this modern era, a fee in that region for a goalscorer as prolific as Osimhen, who is entering the prime of his career at the age of 26, represents good value. He has scored 84 goals since the beginning of the 2022/23 season for Napoli and Galatasaray combined.",
      "However, a lack of European football could hold United back. He scored six times in seven Europa League appearances this season."

      "For the second Wednesday running, Manchester United had to traipse past dignitaries to collect their silver medals.",
      "The Maybank Challenge Cup was not exactly coveted. It was on the table in a room adjacent to the press conference room. Three of us requested a picture with it, so a few from Manchester managed to get their hands on the trophy.",
      "Some United players tried to make a quick getaway after full-time. Dave Harrison, the director of football operations who finds himself chaperoning United players around stadiums, reminded them to observe the post-match procession.",
      "After United collected their medals, Casemiro, Alejandro Garnacho, Harry Amass and Toby Collyer again tried to make their exit. But no, they were ushered back onto the pitch to observe the trophy lift by the ASEAN All Stars.",
      "Incongruously, the 1997 non-classic Sing Up For The Champions, an official single released by United when they actually were champions, was played as United collected their medals. The lyrics refer to winning the Football League again in Merseyside and namecheck Ryan Giggs, Gary Pallister, Teddy Sheringham, Andy Cole, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Roy Keane.",
      "Amorim clasped hands and received a warm embrace from the United chief executive Omar Berrada when he collected his medal. He removed it immediately.",
      "\"My biggest concern is that we need to have the feeling that we need to win every game,\" Ruben Amorim said, \"even a small-sided game on the street, that kind of feeling every game, every exercise that is what we have to do to push the players.\"",
      "Nobody feels sorry for the United players after the season they have subjected their supporters to. Whether these players stay or go, the humiliation of losing a final to Tottenham and then to fire blanks again in Malaysia a week later is form that warrants boos.",
      "The last time United were booed on domestic soil was at half-time against Leicester City in the FA Cup fourth round back in February. Leicester somehow lost to United four times in 2024-25 but they threatened a shock that night until Harry Maguire made the most of a linesman's myopia.",
      "Since then, United matchgoers have sworn by harmonious atmospheres. Their end in the San Mames Stadium emptied quicker than a bathtub of water, which was their form of expressing disapproval. United fans are very dignified like that.",
      "Four days later against Aston Villa, there was no pre-match rancour and 'We'll never die' got an early and defiant airing. United also played well and won.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, they were back on unwatchable form. Collyer was booed for playing the ball into touch with United 1-0 down. At full-time, there was more booing.",
      "Amorim understood it. \"I feel always guilty of the performance of the team since I am here in the first game,\" he admitted. \"I am guilty then the boos from the fans, maybe it is something we need because every game that we lost in the Premier League, they were always there. I felt when we finished every time the supporters were with us. Let's see for next season.\"",
      "There were 27 substitutions by Amorim alone. In an occasion that was as far removed from a competitive match as possible - a light show, a Mexican wave, innumerable substitutions - Rasmus Hojlund was still isolated, detached and sloppy.",
      "Hojlund left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium in a cheerful mood, cracking a brief joke with a United press officer. At Amorim's press conference, Hojlund was described as \"a shadow of himself\" and \"hesitant\" by a local reporter.",
      "Maybe Hojlund has seen the writing on the wall. United are waiting on a decision from Liam Delap, only four days younger than Hojlund. Delap would cost half the price, too. But if Delap returns to Manchester it will be to replace Hojlund.",
      "\"Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations,\" Amorim said in response to the query about Hojlund. \"Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season. Even the environment in the training ground can help all these players have more confidence.",
      "\"If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals. We will try to assess that and be prepared.\"",
      "Amorim was already on the United coach when Garnacho strode out, sunglasses on, scanning his phone. Garnacho completely blanked those assembled in the mixed zone, which had descended more into a meet-and-greet pen.",
      "Amorim usually sits in the front row of the coach, so Garnacho will have had to have walked past him. Wearing sunglasses more befitting a superhero with midnight looming in Kuala Lumpur suggested he was trying to make a point.",
      "There is no power struggle between manager and player. It is a non-contest as United have backed Amorim after he told Garnacho that he can leave.",
      "Garnacho did, however, generate genuine adoration from the crowd, along with Bruno Fernandes, the renascent Harry Maguire and, somewhat peculiarly, Andre Onana. Onana, Maguire and Diogo Dalot are now bound for a commercial trek to India while their teammates head on to Hong Kong.",
      "Fernandes was the last to leave and he generously signed some shirts and stopped for pictures. United were in no rush. They were staying in the city another night after defeat.",

      "United had identified Delap, 22, as their priority target and considered him an attainable option amid his £30million release clause that had been triggered following Ipswich's relegation to the Championship.",
      "Delap scored 12 goals in his first full season as a top flight player. And as respectable as Delap's return was in a team that secured just four league wins all season, signing a striker after just one season's worth of experience at the highest level did signify a gamble.",
      "United took a gamble on Rasmus Hojlund in the 2023 summer transfer window and followed suit with their decision to sign Joshua Zirkzee last summer. Those gambles cost United £108.5m.",
      "Of course, the difference with Delap is that he has experience of playing in the Premier League. Nevertheless, he is still raw and yet to prove himself as the seasoned goalscorer United are craving.",
      "The problem for United, however, is that they are not blessed with a bottomless pit. Ruben Amorim has already warned they \"cannot do much\" this summer and chief executive Omar Berrada has said they must be \"prudent\". Those two admissions alone make it clear why United were attracted to Delap.",
      "To make matters worse, United do not have any form of European football to offer to prospective signings for next season. Last Wednesday night's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final ended their hopes of securing a place back in the Champions League.",
      "Having Champions League football within any club's sales pitch is an enormous attraction. It can even be game-changing for some.",
      "United continue to be linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres and other established goal-getters, who, had Champions League football been secured, would have been realistic targets. Players like Gyokeres and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David are now almost guaranteed to go elsewhere.",
      "Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta has been linked with United previously and would be a signing a lot of supporters would get behind after scoring 30 Premier League goals since the beginning of last season. However, Palace will compete in the Europa League next season.",
      "If prospective targets are going to be driven by the hunger to play in Europe, United are going to face an incredibly difficult challenge this summer, and the news of Delap leaning towards moving to Stamford Bridge has just made that particular task even harder.",
      "United need someone who has a proven record at the highest level that can hit the ground running and manage the expectation levels that come with leading the attack for a club of this magnitude.",
      "But signing a striker of that profile is looking as though it will be United's toughest test of the summer, meaning this is where the impact of losing in Bilbao could hit them hardest."

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has insisted that defender Leny Yoro has a promising future ahead of him after a challenging first season at Old Trafford.",
      "Yoro was seen as a coup for United last summer when he joined the club from Lille. In France, the tall centre-back had already earned himself comparisons with Raphael Varane.",
      "At one point, it looked like he could also follow in the footsteps of his fellow countryman as Real Madrid showed interest in his services. However, United managed to fend off their interest and commit him to a five-year deal.",
      "Unfortunately for the teenager, his start at Old Trafford was dampened when he picked up a serious ankle injury against Arsenal in pre-season. This setback ensured that his Premier League debut did not come until December against the same opposition at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "Since then, the defender has managed to avoid any major injury setbacks and became a regular for Amorim in the fixtures that mattered. From the quarter-finals onwards, Yoro played every minute of the Europa League.",
      "After ultimately suffering defeat in his first European final, Yoro took to Instagram on Thursday to reflect on the season. \"Obstacles. Tears. Lessons. Growth,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Thank you for always being there.\" A number of his United teammates supported him with Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee and Diogo Dalot among those to like the post but it was the captain's comment that stood out.",
      "Replying, the Portuguese midfielder penned: \"This is just the beginning of something for your future.\" Such a sentiment will be echoed by plenty of the Old Trafford faithful after seeing plenty of promise from Yoro this season.",
      "The supporters will also hope that Fernandes will be there for the early stages of Yoro's United career. He has been heavily linked with Al Hilal and the Saudi Pro League club reportedly offered him a £700,000 per week ultimatum.",
      "The catch being that they wanted him to commit to the deal by this Thursday. However, that deadline has since passed and there has been no reports that Fernandes has agreed to the personal terms."

      "As part of the move, an obligation to make the switch permanent was included in the Blues finished higher than 14th in the Premier League. Maresca's men finished in the Champions League spots meaning they have an obligation to buy for £25million.",
      "There is a £5m break clause to pull out of the deal, though, sparking doubts over his future at Stamford Bridge. Maresca has confirmed that the club will undergo talks within the next 48 hours following Wednesday night's win in Wroclaw.",

      "Concerns over Alejandro Garnacho's attitude may mean he's bound to leave Manchester United this summer. And one former Carrington coach provided early warning signs about the South American's supposed character flaws.",
      "There’s growing speculation manager Ruben Amorim is prepared to offload Garnacho after the player was left out of United's last match of the season against Aston Villa. The Argentina international was previously dropped from the XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, after which Garnacho publicly expressed his frustration at a \"s***\" season.",
      "Justin Cochrane previously helped lead United's academy when Garnacho starred in the under-18s' FA Youth Cup victory in 2022. The then-17-year-old winger crowned that campaign by winning the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, identifying himself as a future first-team talent.",
      "Cochrane, now a first-team coach at Brentford, noted the player's exceptional talent but also alluded to a mismatch between his conduct and prowess on the pitch. And while he refrained from being overly critical of the young talent, there were hints of possible issues with his behaviour.",
      "Talking to Goal in March 2022 about his efforts to keep Garnacho's ego in check, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender followed up by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. However, the conversation again shifted to prioritising modesty, something that might not have come unless there were existing concerns.",
      "\"My job and the staff's job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" Cochrane added. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that's what we're focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United manager to have issues with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously chastised by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts criticising his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth in April 2024.",
      "Ten Hag later revealed his player had apologised for the incident, suggesting they had put the matter behind them. However, Garnacho was subsequently dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, shortly before he was sacked, for once again liking posts critical of the coach.",
      "Cochrane's comments from 2022 suggest a recurring pattern of behaviour that most coaches would prefer to avoid. And it seems Amorim has reached his limit, with the player apparently free to leave if an appropriate offer is made.",
      "Napoli have shown significant interest in the player during recent transfer windows. However, this potential move may be at risk due to reports suggesting Antonio Conte is ready to depart the club after just one season, having clinched the Serie A title.",
      "This could leave United in a rush to find a club willing to match their valuation for the player. But there's no confusion, it seems, that Amorim is ready to part ways should any outfit stump up the cash, with United supposedly wanting upwards of £60million."

      "Manchester United's season was not bookended by silverware, after all. After the Snapdragon Cup in pre-season, the Maybank Cup eluded them in the post-season tour.",
      "Neither would ever be housed in the Old Trafford museum or featured as attractions for picture opportunities as part of the stadium tour. Ruben Amorim looked uncomfortable enough to be standing behind the Maybank Cup at Tuesday's pre-match press conference.",
      "Amorim was in an invidious position. He would have dreaded hoisting a trophy barely befitting a Sunday League final yet United were beaten in a country they last visited for Michael Owen’s first appearance in July 2009.",
      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",
      "United first visited Malaysia 30 years ago and United at their very worst since relegation still drew a crowd: 72,550 was the official attendance in the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "True to form, United did not provide the game’s only goal as they went 1-0 down for the umpteenth time in the past 12 months. In the 84th minute, there was the familiar scenario of a United winger crossing into the penalty area only for the striker to be nowhere in sight.",
      "Five minutes later, Alejandro Garnacho abandoned selflessness but his shot was wayward. Bruno Fernandes looked at the heavens and his shoulders slumped. A familiar feeling. United got so desperate that Tom Heaton went up for an added-time corner.",
      "There was a Sergio Aguero in the ASEAN All-Stars line-up, but it wasn’t that one. Instead, Maung Maung Lwin wrote his name into Malaysian football folklore as the matchwinner against United.",
      "6,606 miles is an exceedingly long way to travel for a match you will learn nothing from. United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",
      "They sang ‘Glory glory Man United’ in the stands. In a season that could not end soon enough for United, it goes on, on, on."

      "For these reasons, it is also noted that Cunha’s imminent move to Man Utd ‘should not cause sleepless nights or leave the sense that Liverpool have missed out on a jewel’ and he did not make ‘big financial demands’ to FSG, as a deal ‘never reached that stage’.",

They have lived up to this promise and delivered more than I had ever dared hope Liverpool would achieve in a football landscape competing with the likes of City/Chelsea/PSG/Newcastle/Chinese-clubs-10-years-ago/Saudi-clubs-2-years-ago. They brought in Suarez, they brought in Allison and Virgil, they offered 120m for Felipe Caicedo, they are working on major deals this summer.",

They’ll probably get that striker they need, but it won’t be the cure for all ills. They still lack squad depth. They still lack knowhow at the business end of the season. And Arteta doesn’t help with his paranoia and touchline histrionics.",

And now, this afternoon, news is coming through they’re grabbing Delap from under the noses of Manchester United (lol, by the way) which surely represents an upgrade on the erratic Jackson.",
      "If they can now get a decent goalkeeper and a dominant centre back to supplement the quality of James, Cucurella, Enzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Palmer and (presumably) Delap, then you’re looking at a side that can surely only be heading in one direction and that is upwards. It’s easy to scoff at Chelsea these last few years – and a lot of it has been entirely justified – but you just get a feeling that something might just be starting to take off at long last.",

      "Despite the Portuguese champions being sporadically linked with Ronaldo in recent years, it would go against their model of buying and moulding youngsters to sell them for big fees if they sanctioned his return, though I’m sure they would be willing to make an exception in this case.",
      "However, the latter stages of his Man Utd and Portugal careers show he can now only perform to a certain level and the money on offer elsewhere would be too good to dismiss. You could foresee him returning to Sporting as a manager/part-owner down the line, though.",

      "3) CF Monterrey\nThe Mexican side are the first Club World Cup competitor to be mentioned here. This possible move would see him reunite with Mohamed Salah’s best friend, Sergio Ramos, while he’d also line up alongside ex-Sevilla star Lucas Ocampos.",
      "The additions of Ramos and Ocampos make it clear that the rich Liga MX outfit are having a go at attracting past-it stars looking for an easy cash-grab at the end of their careers, so Ronaldo would fit right in.",

      "As a recent report on his three remarkable demands to Al Nassr suggests, Ronaldo wants a lot from whoever he’s playing for, with having a say on off-field matters a likely contributing factor to his final decision.",
      "Botafogo are willing to make such a proposal, with a reported ‘offer’ worth £88m submitted to Ronaldo by owner John Textor, who also holds a stake in Crystal Palace, to play for the Brazilian side and also gain a “percentage of shares” in the American businessman’s Eagle Football Holdings.",

      "Three of those players subsequently had their contracts terminated early, while Lacazette was at least allowed to see out his Arsenal deal before leaving on a free transfer when it expired. Presumably that’s why they have not signed a decent striker since.",

      "Add-ons make things a little murky – Watkins has surely achieved his while Buendia has not – but the total value of the package to bring in Diaby was in a different market to where Villa usually deal.

      "The previous two record signings bumped off this Brentford list by more recent deals were Bryan Mbeumo and Ivan Toney; the hope is that Igor Thiago can have anything close to their success.

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood. They will also make a few pennies on Amdouni after a decent loan spell with Benfica.

      "It took 20 months for Leeds to break their transfer record thrice from July 1999. It took 20 years for Leeds to break their transfer record once from November 2000.

That initial £64m fee paid to Benfica can rise as high as £85m, but not any time soon. That Van Dijk figure is likely to be blown out of the window by the £100m it will likely take to sign Florian Wirtz.",

      "We suspect a lot of those Isak add-ons will have been met, and Newcastle would be more than happy to pay for a player now worth about twice as much. Will FFP ever allow Newcastle to break that record again?",

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Jamie Gittens, Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and is on Arsenal’s shortlist. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Rayan Cherki (Lyon)\nCherki’s best position is still up for debate, but his ability to play anywhere across the front line makes him extremely appealing.",
      "His numbers this season were brilliant: 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances, with 11 assists and 8 goals in Ligue 1 alone. He’s up there for key passes too, with 75 across the top five leagues.",
      "He’s already waved goodbye to Lyon fans, and the club desperately need a big sale. While some reports claimed a release clause of £18.9m, David Ornstein shut that down, confirming there isn’t one and that Lyon will want a much bigger fee.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are interested, and Manchester City are sniffing around as they prepare for life after Kevin De Bruyne – who will reportedly join Napoli on a free.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked.",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",
      "READ NOW: How Andrea Berta should spend his £300m to win Arsenal the Premier League title",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is set to move to Barcelona in the summer transfer window after the clubs came to an agreement, according to reports.",

      "According to reports, there has been an ‘intriguing twist’ in the race to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes, with Al-Hilal ‘ready to pay’.",
      "Fernandes has arguably been Man Utd’s only shining light in a shambolic campaign as Ruben Amorim’s side finished 15th in the Premier League and lost in the Europa League final to miss out on next season’s Champions League.",
      "Despite this, it has been suggested that the Man Utd captain could be sacrificed this summer as Old Trafford chiefs look to raise funds for a huge rebuild, with upgrades required in most positions to make Amorim’s squad suited to his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Fernandes has been sporadically linked with potential moves to Bayern Munich and Real Madrid lately, but Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal are most interested in the Portugal international.",

      "READ: Sell Bruno Fernandes? Man Utd need him to lead rebuild, not pay for it…",
      "It is yet to be revealed whether Fernandes has decided to accept a move to the Middle East, but The Daily Mail‘s Chris Wheeler has revealed that ‘his agent held face-to-face talks with Al-Hilal at a hotel in Riyadh on Thursday night over a mega-money deal for the United captain’.",
      "It is noted that ‘the fact his representative travelled to Riyadh is an intriguing twist’, especially considering ‘talks at the Four Seasons hotel are believed to have continued late into the night’.",
      "The report also revealed the overall package could be worth around £300m.",
      "Wheeler adds:",
      "‘Al-Hilal are prepared to effectively quadruple Fernandes’ salary of £280,000-a-week by increasing it to £700,000 tax-free as part of a package worth up to £200million over three years including bonuses.",
      "‘If he agrees, the club are ready to issue the paperwork on a contract worth around £65m-a-season and make a formal approach to United with a bid in the region of £100m.’",
      "A report from Football Insider claims Man Utd are ‘to accept’ £80-100m offers for Fernandes, with former Premier League scout Mick Brown explaining why it would be “difficult to say no” to these proposals.",
      "Brown said: “Man United have got to make a decision about Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“From the manager’s point of view, he’ll want him to stay because he’s a big part of his squad and the player they can build the team around.",
      "“But it’s still very much up in the air and it’s become the subject of plenty of speculation.",
      "“They’ve been speaking about it behind the scenes and what they’re saying is, they want him to stay, but everybody has a price.",
      "“If somebody comes in with a ridiculous offer for him, the £80-100million range which has been spoken about, then it will be difficult to say no.",
      "“The financial situation they’re in after missing out on Europe means big-money offers will tempt them.",

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has been given a deadline by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal after making him a ‘final contract offer’, according to reports.",

      "7=) Zinedine Zidane\nPeople keep trying to make Zinedine Zidane to United happen. It’s not going to happen.",
      "",
      "7=) Unai Emery\nMight be the one high-profile Premier League manager for whom the Man United job holds more appeal than Man City. He’s already had one crack at replacing a Big Six legend whose fingerprints are all over the club. At least with United he’s a good few steps removed from all that. But swapping what he’s got going at Villa for United would still be a questionable move.",

      "",
      "4) Mauricio Pochettino\nChelsea chose the path of abject stupidity and it appeared to leave the path clear for United to pounce on a manager they had coveted back in his Tottenham days. They decided to eschew that option in favour of sticking with what’s been working so very well for them.",
      "Any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision making during this season are pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job.",

      "3) Oliver Glasner\nThat FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has led the Austrian to be one of the favourites for the Spurs job as well as being very high in the betting here.",
      "",
      "1=) Gareth Southgate\nVery strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen. He said as recently as October: “I won’t coach in the next year for sure, I’m certain of that. I need to give myself time to make good decisions. When you come out of a really big role you need to give your body time, you need to give your mind time.

      "Ipswich fans have had to do a lot of ‘resigning themselves’.",
      "Resigning themselves to the fact the Premier League was going to be incredibly tough. Resigning themselves to losing most games. Resigning themselves to being patronisingly told to stop playing in a naive possession-based style despite not in fact playing that. Resigning themselves to being last on Match of the Day. Resigning themselves to relegation.",
      "But now, Ipswich fans are resigning themselves to something else: the prospect of losing their best player this summer.",
      "The revelation that Liam Delap has a £30m release clause should the club go down was like the doors being swung open on a Black Friday stampede. Teams from across the Premier League were jostling to be first to the checkout, with Chelsea seemingly winning the race to sign a striker who is perhaps worth double that.",
      "Ipswich fans have no ill will to the notion of Delap moving. Selling your best players to bigger clubs is the fate of being a non-elite side and £30million is no small amount for a club like ours – far more than the £3million we got for Aaron Cresswell, who has gone on to make over 300 appearances in the Premier League. (yes it still annoys me.)",
      "Your only hope is that these players stay long enough to give you some good memories. In Liam Delap, that has very much been the case.",
      "I will be the first to admit I had my doubts when we signed him. He cost £15m, making him the second-most-expensive signing in Town’s history and while our most expensive signing – Omari Hutchinson – had at least spent a year on loan with us, Delap was more of an unknown.",
      "For a start, he could have been seen as a Man City cast-off and even if he had a promising season at Hull in 2023/24, the fact City were willing to let him go suggested they did not fully believe in his potential.",
      "But in Kieran McKenna we trust and it took just three games before Town fans had a new hero, his goal against Fulham securing the club’s first point in the Premier League for 22 years.",
      "Analysing a player in 2025 can be done in two ways – the hard data of stats or, for lack of a better term, vibes.",
      "If we start off with the more easily quantifiable stats, Delap is ticking every box. Top goalscorer at the club by a mile; 12 goals from an xG of 9.02; 2.31 shots a game, 1.4 successful dribbles, 3.68 touches in the opposition box and 1.75 fouls won, all for an Ipswich side that has not had time for much attacking this season.",
      "Internationally, he won the Under-19 Euros with England, has played in every age group up to the U-21 level, and recently trained with the senior side – pictured alongside Harry Kane who some predict he will one day replace.",
      "But boiling Delap down to stats misses why he has become such a fan favourite at the club. xG and xA are grand but you would have to create a metric of ‘xTimes run into an opponent, flinging them to the ground and somehow getting away with it much to the fans’ delight’ to truly capture the essence of Delap.",
      "In many ways, he is a traditional number nine. Kick the ball up long and he will become a whirlwind of elbows and arms as he tries to hold off the often much bigger defenders. Ipswich’s first game of the season saw Liverpool visit Portman Road and Town fans soon saw what Delap was about when he sent Virgil van Dijk – and himself – tumbling to the ground.",
      "Playing Ipswich has not been the hardest prospect for anybody this season, but centre-backs will have come away glad that the annoying buzzing bee of Delap is gone.",
      "He can trap the ball, a vital skill for a team under pressure, and on the rare occasion Ipswich wingers were not pegged back, he is able to play smart one-twos and create shots at goal.",
      "He also has the technique to be an adept finisher. His goal away at Aston Villa highlights perhaps the very best of Delap, muscling past two defenders before getting the slightest of touches to steer the ball into the net.",
      "But while number 9s of yesteryear were perhaps a bit slow, a bit too stationary and more focused on putting the ball in the net rather than getting it into a position to do so – Delap is very much the opposite.",
      "His 1.85m build is almost all legs, followed by a fridge-freezer of a chest, which he will more than happily slam into defenders. He is happy to pick the ball up and just run at defenders, a trait that has been passed out of the game of late. Only three players at Ipswich complete more dribbles per 90 than Delap; only two of those have a higher success rate.",
      "He scores tap-ins, he scores penalties, he scores goals from the edge of the area, he scores goals having dribbled his way through a defence. Aside from a 40-yard-volley or a bicycle kick, Delap has treated Ipswich fans to almost every kind of goal there is. Considering chances are few and far between, this ability to turn even the sniff of an opportunity into a goal has been crucial for Town. In Ipswich’s four wins this season, he has scored in three of them.",
      "Delap is also just about on the right side of being slightly unhinged. No forward in the league has been booked more than him this season and those yellows have almost always been fouls committed by steamrolling a just little too hard into an opponent.",
      "But in the same way that if you took away Wayne Rooney’s aggression the player would suffer, telling Delap to calm down may well take away what makes him so good and so endearing to his own club’s supporters. Like a Luis Suarez minus the biting.",
      "Of the top strikers in the league, it is perhaps only Erling Haaland that plays in the same way and while the Norwegian is a more lethal finisher, Delap certainly has the advantage when it comes to pace. Other strikers meanwhile prefer to create as much as they score, passing the ball to the side rather than running at defences.",

      "Even before he moved to Ipswich, he was singled out for praise with Hull boss Liam Rosenior calling him “a special, special talent”. Since moving to Suffolk, his stock has only risen. McKenna, who is not known for his overly emotive language, said not only has he “evolved his game” but he was “incredibly receptive and very football smart”.",

      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe.

      "Chelsea would like Jadon Sancho to stay if they can agree on contract terms that fit their wage structure; the Blues have a £25m obligation to buy the Manchester United loanee but can pay £5m should they opt against making the move permanent",
      "Friday 30 May 2025 08:34, UK",
      "Chelsea are in talks with Jadon Sancho's representatives about new contract terms.",
      "The Blues would like Sancho to stay if they can agree on contract terms which fit in with the wage structure at the club.",
      "Sancho joined Chelsea on loan from Manchester United last August, and Chelsea now have a £25m obligation to buy. They can pay United a £5m penalty to get out of the obligation to buy.",
      "United signed Sancho for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, and the 25-year-old has a year left on his lucrative United contract, which is believed to be worth up to £300,000 a week, with the option of a further year.",
      "There remains a chance that Sancho goes back to Manchester United even though Chelsea want him to stay, if contract terms can be agreed. Chelsea will not be able to offer him the same terms he is on at United as their policy is to sign players on long, incentivised contracts with lower base wages.",
      "Sancho came off the bench to score as Chelsea beat Real Betis 4-1 in the Conference League final on Wednesday night. His 83rd-minute strike to make it 3-1 at the time was his fifth goal of the season. The winger has also set up 10 goals this campaign across all competitions.",

      "Chelsea will now discuss personal terms with the player's representatives, with discussions expected to be a formality ahead of an eventual medical.",
      "Champions League football is not the main reason Delap is joining Chelsea. Instead, the style of play, a young squad, opportunities to play, the likelihood of being able to challenge for major trophies together for years to come and relationships with people already at Chelsea are understood to have played a part.",
      "Delap watched Chelsea's Conference League final win over Real Betis and was very impressed with the second-half performance.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."

      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",

      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",

      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."
