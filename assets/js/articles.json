      "Manchester United are currently in the middle of their pre-season tour of America - but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing going on at Old Trafford. The Red Devils are hard at work trying to add more new faces to Ruben Amorim’s squad ahead of the new season.",
      "United have already rubber-stamped three summer arrivals: Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have both completed moves from both Wolves and Brentford respectively, while young defender Diego Leon has also completed a move to Manchester.",
      "But United are not finished there with more incomings and player sales expected before the transfer deadline.",
      "A striker is also on their shopping list, with RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko emerging as the club's priority transfer target. Talks regarding his arrival are ongoing.",
      "Elsewhere, outgoings are also on the agenda. Marcus Rashford has already completed a move away from the club after joining Barcelona. Take a look at all of the latest transfer rumours:",
      "Man United defender Patrick Dorgu claims he still has plenty of faith in Rasmus Hojlund despite the club chasing Benjamin Sesko. “He's doing really well,” said Dorgu. “He looks sharp, he looks fit and I'm very happy for Rasmus to get his goal.",
      "“It was a difficult season for Rasmus. Not only for him, but for everyone, so I think this season is really important for him and for the team to get back to where we have to be in the league.",
      "“We need a striker to deliver on the pitch, so that's why he was happy. We talk in training, we try to understand each other on the pitch, for me to know where he is in the box and what movements he likes. He needs confidence, everyone needs confidence and a goal always helps with that.”",
      "Juventus chief Damien Comolli has suggested that his side are still interested in Jadon Sancho - but will only make a move should one of their current widemen leave. He said: “I think the club is very attractive; many agents and players are calling me. After all, we are Juventus, and we want to get back to winning ways.",
      "“Securing Conceição’s permanence was a clear and strong decision because he can play on both fronts. We have two of the best wingers in the world, and Nico is a great player. If someone were to leave, we will consider him [Sancho].\"",
      "Sancho was in line for a move to Chelsea this summer after spending last season on loan but the Blues decided to pay a £5m penalty fee to back out of the agreement.",
      "The Italian has entered the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes, with the French side having signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille as a potential replacement. But Donnarumma could yet stay.",
      "A further year with PSG has not been ruled out and the Italian is in no rush to make a decision on his future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "This situation is not recent and has been the case for several years, according to the source.",
      "It's reportedly the same scenario at Real Madrid, who are also prohibited from printing the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, another icon at the Bernabéu, they added.",
      "Several supporters expressed surprise at the rule.",

      "Ruben Amorim made his Manchester United players work through their summer break to ensure they were in peak condition when they reported back for pre-season training",
      "After United ended last season in 15th place, their lowest-ever Premier League finish, Amorim sent his players away for the summer with strict fitness programmes to follow. All of United’s players were given detailed fitness programmes to follow during their holidays and it became clear to sports science staff when they reported back for pre-season that the squad had followed the instructions.",
      "On the first few days back for pre-season training, United’s players undertook a series of running drills, with the times they posted confirming their adherence to what was asked of them during the summer break. United’s players have looked sharp in pre-season and the feeling is the fitness work undertaken during the close season helped them to hit the ground running in the build-up to the new campaign",
      "In Chicago, United’s base for their three game US tour, the players have been doing a lot of gym work and disguised fitness drills, in which they will shoot at goal then sprint for 60 yards to build up their stamina, then shoot in another goal and repeat the drill. The purpose of the drill is to build up the fitness levels of the players through the sprints, while disguising the motive within shooting practice, so there is some ball work involved to break the tedium of just running.",
      "On tour, United’s players have breakfast from 7.30am and must be on the team coach by 9.15am to go to training. After half a hour in the gym, training sessions begin at 10.30am.",
      "Unlike on previous tours, there have been no double sessions, with the intensity of the single sessions considered sufficient for the players, who are rewarded with the afternoons off from around 1pm.",
      "While Amorim has enforced discipline and standards in terms of timekeeping and curfews on tour, his approach has not been as draconian as his predecessor Erik ten Hag, who also took a hardline stance on punctuality and dress code in terms of wearing the right kit on certain days.",
      "Amorim, while expecting high standards of conduct, is said to have fostered more of a bond with his players, who have responded positively to his demands, unlike Ten Hag, whose aloof and detached approach ultimately served to alienate them.",

    "body": [
      "Sir Alex Ferguson's private chat about losing Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid speaks volumes about the fate Newcastle United face should Alexander Isak depart. Following his £60million move to the Magpies from Real Sociedad in 2023, the Swedish striker has wasted no time whatsoever in becoming a legend on Tyneside.",
      "The 25-year-old has managed 62 goals and 11 assists in 109 outings and was instrumental to the club's fifth-place finish last season as well as their Carabao Cup trophy, scoring the decisive goal in Newcastle's 2-1 win over Premier League champions Liverpool in the final.",
      "But he's put his Newcastle legacy in serious jeopardy by confirming that he wishes to explore his options away from St. James' Park this summer. And should Isak be allowed to leave his current club ahead of the new season, former Magpies boss Pardew has noted how Eddie Howe will be up against it in trying to find a replacement.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Pardew said: \"These are the tests you get as a Premier League manager, whether you're at the top of the league, in the middle or at the bottom. You're going to get tests and Eddie's getting tested here by one of his main players.\"",
      "Pardew also recalled how Ferguson was once in a similar predicament when Ronaldo parted ways with the Red Devils in the summer of 2009, leaving the legendary Manchester United manager aware that he would be unable to find a like-for-like replacement for one of football's greatest-ever players, who was at the time just hitting his prime.",
      "He added: \"I remember Alex Ferguson talking about Ronaldo. It was a game just before he was about to leave. I said, ‘How are you going to replace him?’ He said, ‘Well, I'm not going to be able to replace him. There's no one who can do the numbers, right?’",
      "\"And Isak would be exactly the same. He's not going to get anyone who can do those numbers that Isak can do. So, you're going to have to spread it around and buy two players. That's what Fergie did.",
      "\"I think he said, ‘I'm going to buy two or three to try and replicate what he does within the team unit.' And that's what Eddie is going to have to do.\"",
      "Ferguson's assumptions of being unable to find an outright replacement for Ronaldo were quickly proven right. While the now 83-year-old will have had high hopes for Michael Owen, Gabriel Obertan and Mame Diouf, they fell well short of the pace, precision and sheer skill that Ronaldo brought to the starting XI.",
      "For context, Diouf lasted just three years with the Red Devils, making just nine appearances for the first team before he was sold on to Hanover 96, while Obertan played 27 times before he was sold on to Newcastle in 2011. Owen, meanwhile, scored 17 goals in 52 appearances before joining Stoke City in 2012.",
      "Newcastle have endured a lacklustre summer transfer window thus far, with Anthony Elanga's £55m transfer from Nottingham Forest coming as the side's marquee signing. It's not for a lack of trying, however, with the Magpies linked with the likes of James Trafford, Bryan Mbeumo and Hugo Ekitike, only for them to join Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool respectively.",
      "Braced for the potential departure of Isak in the coming weeks, the Magpies are currently monitoring the situation of RB Leipzig striker, Benjamin Sesko, who has impressed in the Bundesliga at the age of just 22. However, they face stiff competition from the Red Devils in their pursuit, given Ruben Amorim is still on the hunt for a proven No. 9 to lead his attacking line, and are hindered by reports that Sesko favours a move to the north west instead of the north east.",
      "The good news for Newcastle fans is that there aren't actually many teams who can afford a mega-money swoop for Isak this summer, given that the Magpies firmly value the star at a staggering £150m. On Friday it was reported that Newcastle had also swiftly rebuffed Liverpool's first official offer totalling £120m for the talisman, after months of speculation on whether they would make an audacious approach considering they've already spent a guaranteed £100m on Florian Wirtz.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lee Grant takes charge of his first competitive game in management tomorrow afternoon but Huddersfield ’s new boss admits the role has already been consuming every waking minute for weeks.",
      "And the former Manchester United goalkeeper is confident he has all the knowledge to succeed because of his apprenticeship under the man he says is Britain’s best young boss.",
      "Grant, whose Terriers host Leyton Orient in their League One opener this afternoon, spent three years as an assistant to Kieran McKenna at Ipswich Town.",
      "Having helped navigate the Tractor Boys from the third tier to the promised land, Grant believes that education can only stand him in good stead – even if he is determined to be his own man.",
      "“The way he has been able to build, shape and mould Ipswich and for me having a bird’s eye view in terms of how he went about doing that was hugely influential on me,” Grant says. “I’d like to think some of his work ethic, his process and attention to detail has really rubbed off.",
      "“The real eye-opener for me heading from my playing career, where I was already dipping my toe in at Manchester United with the youth team and in the office with the manager, was once you actually step into the world of Kieran McKenna you quickly realise the dedication, the sacrifices needed to work at that level.",
      "“Perhaps my coaches can tell you better but in terms of the work ethic, demands and sacrifices needed at Huddersfield Town right now is quite significant.”",
      "Grant says he will feel a sense of pride when arriving at the Accu Stadium but come 3pm that will have washed away.",
      "“I’ve really enjoyed it so far, it’s really busy and my phone doesn’t stop,\" he says. \"It tends to be people just pestering me for players, agents and other clubs, and it’s not been easy finding time for anything else. But if I’m honest that’s what I love, throwing myself into every single part of the job.",
      "Grant also saw the methods of Jose Mourinho up close while at Old Trafford. The now Fenerbahce boss recently hit out at coaches who refuse to deviate from their game plan when situations demand flexibility.",
      "And that view chimes with Grant as he tries to develop a team capable of winning games in different ways.",
      "“I believe you need to look at every game and the challenges the opposition are going to put on you, and not be too biased by whether you’ve just won or lost at the weekend,” he says. “Having a squad that’s deep enough to offer different solutions and characteristics is really important.",
      "“It would be the perfect scenario for me if we can win a game and then I make four or five changes and win the next one as well.”",
      "He has no shortage of depth having been backed heavily in the transfer market. Eleven new faces, including goalscorer Alfie May and new captain Ryan Ledson, have come in so far with a loan move for Chelsea youngster Leo Castledine also being lined up.",
      "That sees them installed as second favourites to win the title, behind only Luton, and Grant is happy to embrace high expectations.",
      "“This club has what is required to do it,” he says. “We’ve got to work hard for it, we’re not owed anything, but we’re comfortable with the fact that we’re a good team and we want to be a good team.",
      "“If people want to give us that moniker then wonderful but we certainly have to earn it.” Words that sound awfully like McKenna.",

      "Manchester United's striker pursuit suggests they have moved on from the approach which ran throughout Erik ten Hag's time in charge. Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell appears to be taking the lead in the search for a new No 9, despite Ruben Amorim's apparent preferences.",
      "United have attempted to streamline their scouting operation in an effort to bring an end to the poor recruitment of years gone by. Bad investments have left the club battling to offload high-earning stars who are surplus to requirements, and the goal this summer is to get back on the right path.",
      "According to talkSPORT, Amorim would favour a move for Ollie Watkins. He has already signed two players with Premier League experience in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo and in Watkins, Amorim has his eyes on a third.",
      "However, the same publication suggests Vivell is leading a push for an alternative target in the form of Benjamin Sesko. Slovenia frontman Sesko would cost a little more - with RB Leipzig after a fee in the region of £70m - but he is several years younger than Watkins.",
      "United aren't the only ones keen on Sesko, with Newcastle keen to bring the former Red Bull Salzburg star to St James' Park. However, Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves are said to be taking a hands-on approach, with Sesko expected to make a decision in the coming days.",
      "Villa's £60m asking price for Watkins also appears to be north of what United are willing to pay. Reports earlier this week suggested they were exploring a player-plus-cash deal involving Alejandro Garnacho, but there has been no movement on that front.",
      "Sesko appears to be the top target, though. And it seems to show a level of joined-up thinking on the recruitment front which wasn't always present under previous ownership - or, indeed, in the early part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's tenure.",
      "Ratcliffe has trimmed down United's scouting team since taking charge. And now former Chelsea and RB Leipzig man Vivell - who joined permanently earlier this year after taking a temporary role during the summer 2024 transfer window - had taken a hands-on role.",
      "United have sent a number of players out on loan as they gear up for the new campaign. Marcus Rashford will spend the season at Barcelona while Dan Gore has made a temporary switch to Rotherham, and the Red Devils confirmed on Friday that Ethan Wheatley has joined Northampton on a year-long deal.",
      "\"He has played in the Premier League for Manchester United at the age of 18 and you don't do that without having a lot of ability,\" Northampton boss Kevin Nolan said after the youngster's arrival was announced. \"I have seen enough of him to know what he is all about, what his attributes are and to believe that he can come in and be a good addition for us.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has created a 'Fight Club' mentality at Manchester United as he tries to haul them off the canvas following their worst Premier League season. United ended last season in 15th place, their worst league finish for half a century, and missed out on Europe with defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League.",
      "Against that backdrop, battered and bruised United are at their lowest point since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, when he led the club to their last league title. The recovery process began with Amorim exiling five players – Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrrell Malaica - in a 'bomb squad' training away from the main group.",
      "Rashford secured a season-long loan move to Barcelona, with the remaining four left behind as Amorim took his squad on tour of the US to strengthen bonds and continue their rebirth. In the States, United have looked a different team to the rabble of last season, with players looking sharper, hungrier and committed, putting the interests of the team above their own.",
      "Wins over West Ham and Bournemouth, the latter an emphatic 4-1 victory, have suggested United will pack a punch next season, a feeling endorsed by defender Diogo Dalot. “I think straight away it's the connection between the players,” said Dalot.",
      "“I think we're now creating a group that fights for each other. I think that's what we're trying to create. Obviously, there's still a long way to go. I'm not going to say perfect because it's difficult, but that's where we want to go, towards perfection.",
      "“But obviously, I think you can see straight away, some signs of the team fighting a bit more, having more intensity and that's what we're trying to do. I think Ruben is really good as a manager in terms of trying to take the best out of you.",
      "“He's very clear in his messages that you want to be a part of the team or you cannot be here. If you want to be at Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you're not able to match it, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.",
      "“If you started pre-season, it's because he believes that we're the group that needs to come. Obviously, we had players coming in, which is always amazing. You can feel straight away that they match those standards. We're really happy with how things are going, but we're not going to get carried away by the results of what we're doing. It just has to give you motivation that when you do things right, you get the results.”",
      "Despite such a positive pre-season tour as part of the Premier League's Summer Series, Dalot knows United's players cannot afford to get carried away. They have a tough start to the new season, hosting Arsenal in their opening fixture and local rivals Manchester City three games later, then Chelsea and champions Liverpool in quick succession.",
      "But there is a new-found confidence about United in pre-season, boosted by skipper Bruno Fernandes rejecting a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League and committing himself to the team. “I think it's a clear message that he still believes that this club can go to the places that it should be,” said Dalot.",
      "“I don't think there's a better way of starting a season than your captain staying and believing that this can go in the right direction. It's a clear message for the other team-mates, for everybody, that we have to believe. We have to work really hard to put Manchester United back in the place it deserves.”",

      "Signed in January for £25million, Dorgu looks to have cemented his status as Ruben Amorim's first-choice left wing-back with his rampaging runs and attacking threat. And the 20-year-old is confident United will hit the ground running when the new season starts and surprise those who expect them to fall short again.",

      "“You can see on the pitch that we're playing as a more active team. With the press, we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone. I feel like everyone left last season to last season and everyone is just looking forward to the new season, so everyone is positive.",
      "“I came in at a difficult moment last season and I think the team is improving a lot. It's more like a collective than an individual. I feel like everyone is positive and looking forward to the season.\"",
      "Dorgu provided the assist for United and Denmark team-mate Rasmus Hojlund to open the scoring against Bournemouth and said the goal will do wonders for the striker's confidence. United are pushing to sign £70m-rated Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, but Dorgu backed Hojlund to prove his enduring value.",
      "“He's doing really well,” said Dorgu. “He looks sharp, he looks fit and I'm very happy for Rasmus to get his goal.",
      "“It was a difficult season for Rasmus. Not only for him, but for everyone, so I think this season is really important for him and for the team to get back to where we have to be in the league.",
      "“We need a striker to deliver on the pitch, so that's why he was happy. We talk in training, we try to understand each other on the pitch, for me to know where he is in the box and what movements he likes. He needs confidence, everyone needs confidence and a goal always helps with that.”",

      "Lisandro Martinez is closing in on a Manchester United return ahead of the new season. The Argentine defender has been ruled out since February with a serious knee injury.",
      "But he is edging towards a return to the side, with further progress made during United’s pre-season tour in the United States. Martinez is continuing his rehabilitation with his teammates in Chicago as he aims to return to the pitch.",
      "That means Martinez could still be sidelined for United’s Premier League opener against Arsenal in just over a fortnight.",
      "Speaking ahead of that game, Martinez said: “The club is obviously going through a process of change. Since Sir Alex Ferguson 's departure, they haven't found a manager who hits the right note. Ten Hag did a remarkable job at Ajax, which is why he went to United, and thanks to him, I joined the club as well.",
      "\"It's like everything in life: you take a gamble, and sometimes it works out well, sometimes it doesn't. I think that, like any club, if something isn't working, it needs to be changed. It's necessary to analyse what's working and what isn't and make changes accordingly because that's how great clubs operate. Manchester is one of the best clubs in the world.",
      "\"Now Ruben Amorim has arrived with very good energy and willingness. I believe he will make the necessary changes. Without a doubt change is needed, because where we ended up in the table over the last two seasons is unacceptable.\"",
      "As Martinez steps up his recovery, Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee are both back training after their own respective issues.",
      "Onana has been struggling with a hamstring strain, while Zirkzee picked up a slight issue at the start of pre-season. But both have returned to the pitch and will step up their respective recoveries over the coming week.",
      "Speaking about his issue, Zirkzee said: \"I’ve got a small injury but it shouldn’t take too long to recover now. I’ve got great physios working with me every day.",
      "\"It’s not a serious problem. It’s pre-season so unlike last season where I wanted to push myself to be back for the final, obviously now I just want to be there for the start of the season.\"",
      "United take on Everton on Sunday before their final pre-season game against Italian side Fiorentina in just over a week’s time. They then have a further eight days to fine-tune any aspects of Ruben Amorim’s tactics ahead of the season opener against Arsenal.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Giuseppe Rossi has opened up on a story from Roy Keane's autobiography, revealing he was the mystery player the Irishman spoke about. As Keane told it, Rossi narrowly avoided a slap after glaring at United's captain.",
      "Rossi was just 18 when Keane left United, so will have still been in his teens when the incident took place. And the Italian international, who retired in 2023, has opened up on the incident.",
      "“Keane wrote that one time in training he had told off a young Italian player for not passing him the ball and this young lad replied with a strong glare, a challenge,\" Rossi told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \"If that kid had said something, he would’ve got a slap, but he was silent and his gaze spoke volumes. So he walked over to shake his hand.",
      "“Well, that kid was me. And I don’t remember it at all! Evidently I was in a trance and my determination to create a career was absolute.”",
      "Rossi had a nomadic career after leaving Old Trafford, playing in Italy, Spain and the United States. The American-born star, who won 30 caps for Italy, also reflected on working under Sir Alex Ferguson during his time in English football.",
      "“He was a surprise, because he was an austere person, but also affectionate and attentive, a paternal figure who knew how to treat young players like gems,\" Rossi said. \"He would protect and motivate them to help them grow as both people and players, with precise values and rules.",
      "“In training, it was like another sport to what I was accustomed to, this brutal pace and intensity. There were no friends in training, lots of shoves, kicks, aggression. I quickly realised what I had to do to earn respect in that squad. I was physically behind the rest, so I had to make do with technique and intelligence.”",
      "Rossi wasn't the only United newcomer to fall afoul of Keane towards the end of the captain's time in Manchester. Gabriel Heinze joined in the same summer as Rossi, back in 2004, and claimed to have been sparked out by Keane early in his spell with the club.",
      "\"The first thing you hear in English or in another language are bad words,\" Heinze, who recently joined Arsenal's coaching staff, said in 2022. \"He (Keane) was looking at me and he says to me: \"F*** off!\" And I knew that was a dirty word.",
      "\"I stood up and the guy comes over to me. C'mon, I was only a kid. So I repeated it back to him, I said \"f*** off you!. Then I don't remember anything else...\"",

      "Sancho has been widely linked with a move to Turin after seeing Chelsea pay a £5million penalty to avoid making his loan move permanent earlier this summer. The former Borussia Dortmund star has not been in Ruben Amorim's plans this summer as the club tour the United States.",
      "United are already said to have accepted that they will have 'no choice' but to accept a fee of less than £25million for Sancho this summer, amid negotiations with Juve. For his part, Sancho is said to be willing to slash his wages in half to facilitate an exit from Old Trafford.",
      "Momentum had seemed to be growing over a move to Serie A, with the Bianconeri said to have agreed personal terms and a fee of £15m for Sancho's services. But it emerged sales could first be required and Comolli has now confirmed as much.",
      "The club official was asked about the prospect of signing Sancho this summer and said, per Sport Witness: “I think the club is very attractive; many agents and players are calling me. After all, we are Juventus, and we want to get back to winning ways.",
      "“Securing Conceição’s permanence was a clear and strong decision because he can play on both fronts. We have two of the best wingers in the world, and Nico is a great player. If someone were to leave, we will consider him [Sancho].\"",

      "Turkish shot-stopper Altay Bayindir is currently the owner of the No. 1 jersey at Old Trafford. Since David de Gea's departure under Erik ten Hag, United have had difficulties with their goalkeeping options.",
      "Andre Onana was brought in for £47m but has been inconsistent between the sticks, sparking rumours that United might be looking to recruit a new first-choice goalkeeper. With Donnarumma's future at Paris Saint Germain uncertain, despite his heroics in their Champions League winning campaign, United have been linked with an audacious move.",
      "Reports from France claim United are contemplating a move for the Euro 2020 winner. L'Equipe understands both United and Manchester City have expressed interest in bringing the Italian to their clubs after negotiations between PSG and the shot-stopper hit a wall.",
      "From United's point of view, a potential move for Donnarumma would be a significant expense, especially when they also need to bolster their attack. But if they can find the funds for him, they could offer him the No. 99 shirt.",
      "Two things would be accomplished if they did this. Firstly, he would be reunited with the unusual number he wore at AC Milan, the club he joined when he was only 14 years old. Secondly, he would become the first ever United player to wear the number.",
      "Donnarumma would almost certainly be United's first choice goalkeeper, but Bayindir was given the No. 1 shirt when he signed from Fenerbahce in the summer of 2023.",

      "Donnarumma has also been linked with a move to Chelsea. The Blues are currently pondering on whether to stick or twist with current shot stoppers Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen. Neither goalkeepers were truly convincing between the sticks last season, although the former did enjoy an impressive campaign at the Club World Cup.",

      "Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly in talks to sign former Manchester United target Joao Palhinha. The midfielder had a challenging first season at Bayern Munich, but previously excelled in the Premier League with Fulham.",
      "The 30-year-old was restricted to just six league starts for the German club during an injury-plagued campaign following his move worth up to £47.4million last summer. Palhinha was a standout performer during his two years at Craven Cottage and was reported to be a target for United and several other clubs during his time in West London.",
      "Bayern eventually won the race to sign Palhinha, having initially seen a deadline day move collapse in 2023. There has been speculation that United have reignited their interest in Palhinha this summer, but the midfielder could return to the Premier League with a different club after emerging as a target for Spurs.",
      "The Independent has reported that Tottenham have started negotiations over a possible loan move for the former Sporting Lisbon star. It is claimed that Spurs held an interest in Palhinha prior to him joining Bayern.",
      "A temporary move to Spurs could allow Palhinha to find his best form ahead of the 2026 World Cup and prove a point to Bayern boss Vincent Kompany. Tottenham are well-stocked in midfield but may wish to bolster their squad after gaining Champions League qualification through their Europa League triumph.",
      "Palhinha has previously proven to be decisive when taking the next steps in his career. Sky Germany reported that the former Fulham midfielder made it clear he would turn down any approach from United as he remained committed to joining Bayern last summer following his collapsed transfer.",
      "Fulham were reported to have demanded £60m for Palhinha, who was claimed to have attracted interest from United, Barcelona and Bayern. Nevertheless, the doubt surrounding then-United manager Erik ten Hag's position, who would pen a contract extension only to face dismissal in October, failed to improve the club's chances of swaying Palhinha.",
      "United's squandered opportunity could prove to be a boost for Spurs should Palhinha join Thomas Frank's outfit on loan. Yet the defensive midfielder will be keen to sidestep another protracted transfer ordeal, having recalled the uncomfortable predicament he faced at Fulham in 2023.",
      "\"Obviously, it affected me and my family a lot, but it's water under the bridge, I don't want to remember too much about it,\" Palhinha said of his collapsed move to Bayern. \"It's a great pride, you know what happened. In my life everything that has been happening – it has been for a reason, I like to think that way. The future will tell me whether what really happened was what had to happen or not.",
      "\"But only the future will show me that. I want to continue walking the journey as I've been doing, no one has given me anything throughout my career, everything I've achieved is earned, for my work. I hope that continues to be the case. I'm 28 years old, but I know I can reach higher and it's with this ambition that I face the future.\"",
      "England manager Thomas Tuchel praised Palhinha when he expressed regret at failing to land his midfield target. \"I was sad because I know what he would have added to our team,\" former Bayern boss Tuchel admitted.",
      "\"He was sad and disappointed. We'll speak again about what happened. Everyone did what they had to do, but it was too late in the end.\"",
      "United brought in Manuel Ugarte from Sporting during the same transfer window that saw Palhinha finally complete his switch to Bayern. The £51m midfielder, who previously played alongside Palhinha, featured in 45 matches during his first campaign at United and has been reunited with manager Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "Meanwhile, Tottenham secured a 1-0 victory over north London rivals Arsenal at the Kai Tak Sports Park in Hong Kong on Thursday, with midfielder Pape Matar Sarr netting the match's only goal. The club have recruited Mohammed Kudus for £55m and confirmed permanent deals for former loanees Kevin Danso and Mathys Tel, while also capturing several promising youngsters during the summer transfer window.",

      "Amorim is desperate to add more firepower to his squad after watching them finish 15th last season and Hojlund could not help the team as he managed just four goals in the Premier League, infuriating fans in the process.",
      "There had even been reports from the Athletic that United's interest in Sesko could lead to Hojlund, signed for a whopping £72m, going the other way in a swap deal.",
      "But now the Sun has claimed that Sesko's arrival would not spell the end for Hojlund, with Amorim believing the Slovenian can actually help the former Atalanta man raise his game by giving him some serious competition.",
      "United may have to spend as much as £70m to land Sesko after making him their priority transfer target over Ollie Watkins, who is valued at £60m by Aston Villa. United felt that Sesko represented better long-term value given he is five years younger.",
      "And Amorim is increasingly positive about the prospect of Sesko joining the club and feels he can get the best out of him - just as he did with Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Lisbon, the report adds.",
      "It says the Portuguese coach sees Sesko as the \"dynamite\" United need up front to return to the glory days after a dismal season saw them lose 17 games in the top flight.",
      "Amorim is also said to think the lack of competition in attack last season contributed to Hojlund's poor season, with Joshua Zirkzee also struggling with just three goals in the Premier League.",
      "The presence of the two players at the club would add pressure on both players to succeed, which might be a factor in Amorim keeping Hojlund for the time being. The Denmark international has been included in Amorim's pre-season plans, unlike players like Jadon Sancho, Antony and Marcus Rashford who have been frozen out.",
      "He showed his desire to keep progressing by scoring a brace in a 4-1 friendly win over Bournemouth, leading to praise from his manager. \"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,’ the coach said. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long].",
      "\"I’m really happy with Rasmus. I don’t know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",

      "Manchester United misfit Jadon Sancho is said to be willing to take a 50 per cent pay cut on his eye-watering salary at Old Trafford in order to secure a move to his former club, Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho joined United in a £73million deal from Dortmund back in the summer of 2021 but has struggled to meet expectations and has fallen out of favour under both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Last season he was loaned to Chelsea but his form suffered at Stamford Bridge as he scored just three Premier League goals from 19 top flight starts.",
      "And in a brutal end to his spell with the Blues, the London side opted not to turn his move permanent for £25m - instead paying a £5m penalty fee to send him back to United.",
      "Sancho has since been cast aside from Amorim's team and forced to train alone as part of the \"Bomb Squad\" at their Carrington complex.",
      "He has been strongly linked with a move to Juventus but news on that front has gone cold. Now, reports from German outlet Bild report that he has held initial conversations about a possible return to Dortmund.",
      "Sancho already enjoyed a successful return to the Bundesliga side on loan for the second part of the 2023-24 season, where he scored three times and led the team to the Champions League final. And another season at Signal Iduna Park could now be on the cards, with Sancho said to be pushing for the move.",
      "The report adds that Sancho is willing to take a huge pay cut in order to seal his return to Dortmund and would even consider dropping his current £275,000-a-week salary by half. Sancho is believed to have spoken with Dortmund chiefs Lars Ricken and Sebastian Kehl in the hopes of sealing the transfer and ending his exile at Old Trafford.",
      "Sancho is one of five players who were left out of United's pre-season tour of the United States, joining Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Marcus Rashford - who has since signed for Barcelona on loan.",
      "Amorim said the thinking behind excluding the group of players was to give them more time to think about their futures and said they would link up with the squad if they did not find new clubs.",
      "\"We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide,\" he said. \"If we reach a point where they have to join the team, they will join because they are our players. I know Jason, Omar and the club have a number for these players.\"",

      "Manchester United's interest in striker Benjamin Sesko has led to speculation of a swap deal involving Rasmus Hojlund. RB Leipzig star Sesko has emerged as Ruben Amorim's top forward target this summer ahead of Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko has long been admired by the Red Devils, catching their eye even before his move to Red Bull Salzburg. Now, having set the Bundesliga alight at 22 with Leipzig, the club are reportedly in for him once again.",
      "Talks are supposedly underway, and a fee in the region of £70million has been mooted as the Slovenian superstar's price tag. United already spent big on a No. 9 when they signed Danish ace Hojlund from Atalanta in 2023, and it is now suggested that the 22-year-old could be included in a potential swap deal at a dramatically cut price.",
      "The Athletic report that Leipzig are one of several parties interested in taking on the out-of-sorts Hojlund, and the prospect of some form of swap deal including Sesko has been raised, though it looks unlikely at this stage.",
      "Although the 22-year-old cost the Red Devils £72m, they would have to fork out a cash sum alongside their player to secure Sesko's services in any potential swap deal.",
      "The report states that United acknowledges internally that Hojlund's market value would be nowhere near what they paid for him and currently stands a little under £45m. This is a drop of £27m in just two years since his big-money move to Old Trafford.",
      "In light of Sesko becoming United's top striker target and competition for minutes potentially becoming scarce, Hojlund was questioned about his Old Trafford future and responded bullishly.",
      "The Dane claimed he wishes to remain in Manchester and grapple with any prospective recruit for gametime, making any swap deal unlikely, unless United wish to cash in on a star whose worth has plummeted.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens,\" declared Hojlund.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22.",
      "\"Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland). But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.",
      "\"I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "United are believed to be Sesko's priority over Newcastle but a deal is far from a foregone conclusion. Leipzig want a fee of around £65m, plus add-ons and a sell-on percentage for the Slovenian star.",
      "Amorim will likely have to sell before United can make a big enough offer to tempt the Bundesliga side. Hojlund has not been told he is up for sale and United could raise funds for Sesko through the sales of Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, who are all being linked with moves away for significant fees.",

      "Marcus Rashford's new Barcelona colleagues have already spotted a personality trait that the striker felt was misjudged during his stint at Manchester United. Rashford completed a season-long loan switch to the La Liga champions, who possess an option to make the transfer permanent.",
      "The 27-year-old clocked up more than 400 outings and claimed five trophies with United before determining that his destiny lay elsewhere from his childhood club. After spending time at Aston Villa last campaign, Rashford is savouring the chance to make his mark at Barcelona.",
      "However, Barcelona defender Jules Kounde has already observed that Rashford appears to be slightly quieter than other members of the squad. The England international previously admitted to feeling misunderstood at times during his United career, having had his character regularly questioned by fans and big-name pundits.",
      "\"He's a bit introverted, but he's really enjoying himself, and feeling more and more comfortable,\" Kounde said of Rashford to Diario Sport. \"I think he is happy. He is smiling a lot. He is happy in the field.",
      "\"He reminds me a little of myself. He's a bit introverted, but he's enjoying himself a lot, and I think he's feeling more and more comfortable. Everyone has welcomed him very warmly. He's talking to everyone.",
      "\"I think he's very comfortable. As I speak English, I'm trying to help him as best I can, but I think everyone is doing that.\"",
      "Kounde's remarks mirror what Rashford revealed to journalist Henry Winter last December regarding his personality and how he is perceived: \"I do feel misunderstood, but I'm fine with it. I'm a very simple person. I love football. That's been my life from the beginning.\"",
      "That wasn't the first occasion Rashford had pondered how others view him. The England star described himself as an introvert whilst discussing how he had navigated challenging periods during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "\"If I'm honest honest, a part of me doesn't mind it when people doubt me,\" Rashford wrote for The Players' Tribune in February 2024. \"When everyone is telling me they love me, I get suspicious. I know the way the world works. I had to become a man really young. Always had to rely on myself.",
      "\"Whenever I've been in my darkest of places, and it feels like half the world is against me, I tend to go off by myself for a couple days and reset, and then I'm fine. I think it goes back to me as a kid dribbling all over the street on my own until it was so dark that I couldn't see the ball anymore and I could hear my mum shouting for me to come home.",
      "\"That's just me being an introvert, needing my space to reset. Other times, when that hasn't worked, I've found someone to talk to.",
      "\"Sometimes that's the way to do it. But every single time I've been down, physically or mentally, I always feel like that's when I turn it around and play my best football for United and England.\"",
      "Rashford made his Barcelona debut against Japanese outfit Vissel Kobe last week, coming off the bench for 33 minutes before being substituted. The United loanee most recently came on at half-time during Barcelona's thrilling 7-3 triumph over FC Seoul on Thursday, setting up the final goal scored by former Manchester City ace Ferran Torres.",
      "During his unveiling as a Barcelona player, Rashford reflected on leaving his boyhood club: \"The situation with United is the club is in a period of change and they have been for a while,\" he said. \"So I don't have anything bad to say about Manchester United. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life. I'm grateful for the opportunity to play for them.",
      "\"Football is the same as life. Not everything goes as simple as you may have thought. This is my next step and next chapter. I'm fully focused on this and trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.\"",

      "Chelsea star Nicolas Jackson has insisted \"I have no competition\" at Stamford Bridge as speculation links him with a move away from the club.",
      "The forward has been strongly tipped for a move to Manchester United, who are desperately seeking more firepower for the new season after Ruben Amorim grew frustrated with a lack of clinical finishing from Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "There have even been suggestions of a swap deal between Chelsea and United for Jackson and Alejandro Garnacho, who has fallen out with Amorim.",
      "Jackson had a solid season for Chelsea last term as he netted 10 times in the Premier League and chipped in with another three goals in the UEFA Conference League - scoring in the final as the team beat Real Betis 4-1 - notching 13 in 37 games in all competitions.",
      "But there have been demands from fans and pundits for Jackson to score more goals and Jackson now appears to have slipped down the pecking order after Chelsea signed Ipswich striker Liam Delap for £30m and Joao Pedro from Brighton for £60m, with the latter starring in their FIFA Club World Cup triumph.",
      "Jackson, however, has now hit back at the suggestion that the club's new signings meant that he had a battle to be first choice up front under Enzo Maresca and claimed every player \"has their role to play\".",
      "\"Competition? I have no competition,\" he told DSports TV. \"We’re all here to help the club. Everyone has their role to play. I’m on a mission. It’s up to the coach to make his choices. I focus solely on my work.\"",
      "Jackson was coy on his future and said he was focused on playing for Chelsea as things stood, saying he had no control over any \"changes\" that could come.",
      "\"I’m a Chelsea player,\" he said. \"The future belongs to God. If there are any changes, you’ll know. For now, I’m focused on my preparation. It’s football, there are ups and downs. Last season we won two trophies. There were difficult moments, moments of glory. Every season is like that. But the most important thing is to stay focused, to learn, and to grow in the face of adversity.\"",
      "Jackson has netted a total of 30 goals in 81 appearances since joining Chelsea for around £32million from Villarreal in 2023, including 17 in his first season. Despite links to United, it's understood the Red Devils have ruled out a move for Jackson because Chelsea are demanding between £80m and £100m - and have since pressed on with a move for Red Bull Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But with Villa demanding £60m for 29-year-old Watkins, United have prioritised Sesko's signature given that he will cost roughly the same price, but represents better value for money as he is five years younger.",

      "The reaction from a Manchester United staff member was one of near incredulity at Patrick Dorgu's performance in Chicago.",
      "\"Proficient\" was the word the suit used to describe Dorgu's start at the club. Dorgu, a left back by trade, is developing into a pure winger on the evidence of pre-season.",
      "Those selected for the wide roles in United's 3-4-2-1 system are routinely referred to as \"wing-backs\" when they have to be viewed as wingers. They are picked to service the striker. Dorgu did just that for Rasmus Hojlund's first goal against Bournemouth.",
      "\"We have a very good relationship,\" Hojlund said in the Soldier Field mixed zone. \"There's only one year between us and we have a lot of common friends. We come from the same sort of area in Denmark as well and we're really starting to bond.\"",
      "Dorgu also got on the scoresheet for the first time in United colours. The 20-year-old is more attack-minded and more intense than he was during his sheepish first few months, admittedly in a team that literally could not string two Premier League wins together.",
      "\"I feel like I play the same way,\" Dorgu opined. \"I just came in at a difficult moment and I think the team is improving a lot through the pre-season. I think it's more like a collective than an individual.",
      "\"I feel like we need to attack more and I feel like me and Amad did well today to be attacking and always be a threat in behind.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim struggled to find the right balance with the United team in his first six months. He often picked eight defensive players, hardly in keeping with the club's ethos.",
      "The indecision was apparent in the days leading up to the Europa League final when Bruno Fernandes was suddenly moved back to midfield to accommodate Mason Mount, a decision that hammered the final nail in Alejandro Garnacho's coffin.",
      "Now the defenders are going on the attack. In the absence of Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro is embracing the line-breaking role from centre back, spraying the odd pass from his own third into the opponent's.",
      "Fernandes was urgent in central midfield against Bournemouth, Dorgu was more of an attacker than a defender and Hojlund was ably supported by Amad and Mason Mount. It is a better balance.",
      "United have not put on a full open training session, as they have done on previous tours, due to the sheer amount of tactical work Amorim has presided over. Club media's lenses have not even been permitted entry for those sensitive segments. The players are playing as if they are being coached to within an inch of their lives.",
      "Jose Mourinho privately observed that Amorim's system revolves around \"providing depth to the striker\". United are more direct and pinging more forward passes towards Hojlund, not as isolated in possession.",
      "\"I'm not going to say every training session, but he (Amorim) makes sure that you go prepared for every game,\" Diogo Dalot said. \"We go to every game already knowing what's going to happen, more or less, with the opposition.",
      "\"Obviously, it can happen that they might change something, but the basics of every team, we try to go to every game prepared. We always do the walk-throughs and some tactical work, of course. He's very keen on that so we can be prepared.",
      "\"But at the same time, the message is really clear. There's not too much information, so everybody knows two or three things they need to do during the game.",
      "\"Once we get used to that, I think we will reach a point, hopefully, where we can almost play with our eyes closed. We already know where everybody is going to be on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim personally oversees the tactical walk-throughs. Unlike the dogmatic Louis van Gaal, who infamously admonished a player if he took a shot without first controlling the ball, Amorim trusts the players to make their own decisions in a match environment. His assistant, Carlos Fernandes, continues to take charge of set pieces and certain drills.",
      "The United head coach has settled on a softer form of discipline than Erik ten Hag. Players have breakfast in the Waldorf Astoria from 7.30am and have to be on the coach to training at the Endeavor Health Performance Center by 9.15. There is gym work before the players head onto the grass at 10.30. Amorim usually hits the gym for an hour from 7am each morning.",
      "Ten Hag's dim view of tardy timekeeping caused congestion on the stairwell in United's Bangkok hotel during his first tour in 2022. The lifts in the Athenee hotel were so slow that players sometimes trekked up 40 flights of stairs to make meals on time.",
      "United have performed enterprisingly in their two tour games in New Jersey and Chicago. Their chance-conversion rate in the latter against Bournemouth was most unlike them: four goals from six attempts on target. Most pleasingly for Amorim, United won without either of their £133.5million signings in the squad at Soldier Field.",
      "The team look in sync after a chastening six months getting to grips with Amorim's formation. He has identified the most suitable position for certain players, such as placing Harry Maguire or Matthijs de Ligt in the middle of the back three. A minor adjustment but one that has emboldened Yoro and, to a lesser extent, Ayden Heaven on the left.",
      "Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have not started together, so the outfield is not overloaded with defensive-minded starters. United were initially rigid in the 3-4-2-1 and now look fluid, with Amad and Kobbie Mainoo seamlessly shifting between different roles in the two tour games.",
      "\"More than the results, it's the way they are playing,\" Amorim replied when asked if there was a difference about United. \"I think it's really important. People cannot see that. I think they are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other. Not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"I think they are stronger, they are faster. In this moment, of course, it's a pre-season. But you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"So we are improving. But again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season. It's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game. I think today was a good day.\"",
      "What we can see is this is the fittest United have looked on tour for several years. There was gallows humour in the press box that Matheus Cunha, who spent more time walking than any other outfield player in the Premier League last season, sat out the Bournemouth win due to fatigue. Amorim warned the players at the start of his tenure that they would have to \"run like dogs\".",
      "\"I think we will hopefully see a United team that is attacking more, that's on the front foot,\" Dorgu added, \"that's trying to dominate games, every game. We just take the rest of the pre-season to get even better.",
      "\"I feel like we're getting there, we're playing more as a team, we're running for each other, we just need to fight to win games, we need everyone to play 100 per cent and that's what we're trying to do.",
      "\"You can see it on the pitch that we're playing [as] a more active team. With the press, we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone.\"",
      "Mount revealed at the start of the tour that players were kicking each other more in training to up the intensity. The keep-ball activities at the start of sessions are usually lighthearted looseners. Fernandes was borderline overzealous on Tuesday, flying into Cunha.",
      "Well-placed sources have noticed how pleased the players are that Fernandes has stayed. Amorim quickly came to lean on him last season and his influence is so profound that Amorim regards Fernandes as the Mourinho to his Bobby Robson.",
      "Fernandes and Harry Maguire are the two players who spend the most time with the football staff. Fernandes joined club employees at the W Hotel bar on the post-season tour in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "The last time the majority of United's starters played for more than an hour in an opening tour game was in 2018 in Phoenix when Mourinho had to pick a shadow squad a week after the World Cup concluded. Lee Grant was his most senior available goalkeeper and Antonio Valencia, the captain, lasted a half against Club America. Nine days later, Mourinho accused Valencia of enjoying \"too much holiday\" in the close season.",
      "The current United players were all given an individual programme for the close season. Sources say much of it was a specific running drill that the players were tasked with replicating regularly back at the club's Carrington training complex, not dissimilar to a bleep test. The sports scientists have been impressed with the results, proof the players treated the programmes seriously, and the feeling is it has allowed United to hit the ground running in pre-season.",
      "Amorim has eschewed double sessions that have been commonplace on past United tours. From one o'clock onwards, the players are free to do as they please, with a midnight curfew set for them and staff.",
      "United have been based at the Chicago Fire's immaculate training complex that opened this year. United favour a base for their pre-season schedule and the delayed flight to New Jersey for the West Ham match was a minor matter owed to the stormy weather.",
      "Crucially, Amorim ensured United did not schlep across to San Diego to play at the Snapdragon Stadium to keep the sponsors sweet. That would have meant United heading west, where the time zone difference is eight hours as opposed to six in Chicago.",
      "Staff felt the schedule for the 2023 tour - New Jersey, San Diego, in and out of Houston and Las Vegas - affected United's form at the start of a sulphurous season. United seem to be the only football club that has to reiterate that football comes first but on this tour it has.",

      "Diogo Dalot has backed Ruben Amorim's handling of Manchester United's wantaways.",
      "Amorim refused to allow the 'bomb squad' members, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, to train with the United first team amid their wish to leave the club.",
      "Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but the other four players are still at the club, training back in Manchester while the first team is on their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "Amorim dropped Rashford and Garnacho from the squad for the Manchester derby in December and he sanctioned the mid-season loans of Antony and Malacia to Real Betis and PSV Eindhoven. Sancho has not made a competitive appearance for United since August 2023 and does not have a squad number.",
      "The United head coach has stressed that he is only interested in coaching players who want to be at the club and Dalot feels that Amorim's approach has benefited the squad in the States.",
      "\"I think he's really good as a manager of trying to [get] the best out of you,\" Dalot said. \"He's very clear in his messages that you want to be a part of the team or you cannot be here. If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you're not able to match it, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear.",
      "\"The message was that if you started the pre-season, it's because he believes that we are the group that needs to come. Obviously, we had players coming in, which is always amazing. You can feel straight away that they match those standards.",
      "\"We are really happy with how things are going, but we're not going to get carried away by the results of what we are doing. It just has to give you motivation that when you do things right, you get the results.\"",
      "Dalot suggested the strong \"connection\" between the players has underpinned the harmony in United's happy camp. \"I think we are now creating a group that fights for each other. I think that's what we are trying to create.",
      "\"Obviously, there's still a long way to go. I'm not going to say perfect because it's difficult, but that's where we want to go, towards perfection.",
      "\"But obviously, I think you can see straight away some signs of the team fighting a bit more, having more intensity, and that's what we are trying to do.\"",
      "Dalot's club and international teammate, Bruno Fernandes, rejected the chance to leave United for the Saudi Pro League at the start of the summer. Fernandes signed a new three-year contract with United in August 2024 following interest from Bayern Munich and Inter Milan and he went on to claim a fourth Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "However, United endured their worst campaign for 51 years and Al Hilal made a proposal to Fernandes, who ultimately opted to stay at United.",
      "\"I think it's a clear message that he still believes that this club can go to the places that it should be,\" Dalot added. \"I don't think there's a better way of starting a season than your captain staying and believing that this can go in the right direction. It's a clear message for the other teammates, for everybody, that we have to believe.",
      "\"We have to work really hard to put Manchester back on the place that it deserves.\"",
      "Patrick Dorgu played on the opposite flank to Dalot in the 4-1 win against Bournemouth in Chicago and was named the man of the match after he assisted Rasmus Hojlund's opening goal and scored the eventual winner.",
      "Dorgu joined United from Lecce in a £29million deal in the winter transfer window and played regularly on the left wing but did not tally a competitive goal or assist for his new club.",
      "The 20-year-old has shone during United's pre-season and been more attack-minded. Dorgu revealed that United are becoming a \"more active\" side.",
      "\"You can see it on the pitch that we're playing a more active team,\" he explained. \"With the press we run more for each other, so you can see that the pre-season has helped everyone.",
      "\"I think we will hopefully see a United team that is attacking more, that's on the front foot, that's trying to dominate games, every game. We just take the rest of the pre-season to get even better.\"",

      "Martinez ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee against Crystal Palace on February 2 and is continuing his rehabilitation with teammates in the United States.",
      "The 27-year-old has done some individual ball work and running outdoors at the Endeavor Health Performance Center in Chicago but is not ready to re-join team training.",
      "Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee are also training on the grass again in their recovery from injuries. A well-placed source said Onana, who suffered a hamstring strain in training last month, has been \"throwing himself around\" in training but in non-contact drills.",
      "Onana could make his return in United's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina at Old Trafford on August 9, eight days before their first Premier League fixture at home to Arsenal.",
      "United have been in the market for a new goalkeeper and had a loan offer for Emiliano Martinez rejected by Aston Villa earlier this summer.",
      "Zirkzee sustained a minor injury at the start of pre-season and was not able to play in United's games against Leeds United, West Ham United and Bournemouth.",
      "The 24-year-old was rushed back from a hamstring injury to come on in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao but Zirkzee sustained a different injury two weeks ago.",
      "\"I’ve got a small injury but it shouldn’t take too long to recover now,\" Zirkzee said in midweek. \"I’ve got great physios working with me every day.",
      "\"It’s not a serious problem. It’s pre-season so unlike last season where I wanted to push myself to be back for the final, obviously now I just want to be there for the start of the season.\"",

      "Few players impressed in Manchester United colours towards the end of last season more than Leny Yoro.",
      "The centre-back, who arrived from Lille in July last year, went from strength-to-strength in the second half of the campaign and it was not long before United fans were drooling over his potential.",
      "When it was confirmed he had made the starting XI for the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, it gave United a shot in the arm ahead of kick-off. Unfortunately, his presence at the back did not improve their attacking efforts.",
      "Yoro experienced a stop-start debut campaign at Old Trafford because of injury issues. He did not make his competitive debut for the club until December after fracturing his metatarsal in the opening game of their pre-season tour of the United States last July.",
      "Just over a year after his premature exit against Arsenal in Los Angeles, Yoro is reminding United's stateside supporters of what they missed out on last summer.",
      "After starting United's goalless draw with Leeds United in Stockholm on the bench, he has started the opening two games in the US, helping United beat West Ham United (2-1) and most recently Bournemouth (4-1). He has occupied the right-sided centre-back spot on both occasions.",
      "Plenty of caveats have to be taken into account when making judgements on pre-season friendlies, but there is no doubt United have been sharp and enjoyable to watch. They have played with an excellent tempo and plenty of purpose.",
      "There is also no doubt they are benefitting from their first pre-season under head coach Ruben Amorim, who arrived at Old Trafford last November and immediately switched to a three-at-the-back formation. The team has been balanced and everyone understands their roles.",
      "Keen to build through the thirds, there is plenty of expectation on the shoulders of United's centre-backs, particularly those who occupy the two wide berths. Yoro and Ayden Heaven started in those positions against West Ham and Luke Shaw came in to replace the latter for the win over Bournemouth in Chicago.",
      "After playing a couple of really eye-catching cross-field passes during the win over West Ham, helping United get on the front foot and up the pitch in next to no time, Yoro was similarly attack-minded against the Cherries, showing an eagerness to get on the ball and drive up the pitch.",
      "Yoro is very comfortable on the ball and his desire to get up the pitch when in possession cannot be faulted. Amorim wants ball-plying defenders in his ranks and Yoro fits the bill, likewise Heaven.",
      "The Frenchman, who can operate on either the right or the left of the back-three, demonstrating last season that he is comfortable on his unnatural side, is highlighting he wants to become an aggressive centre-back that can get on the ball and advance. And that is something he has already set himself as a personal goal for the coming season.",
      "\"Maybe I would say sometimes the aggressiveness,\" he told Rising Ballers earlier this summer. \"I think I can be more aggressive because with the ball, I need to improve, of course, but I think I'm good [when in possession].\"",
      "Yoro's assertiveness on the ball was particularly noticeable against Bournemouth. He wanted to get the ball played into his feet and advance, regularly crossing the halfway line to occupy attacking positions.",
      "As already documented, caveats have to be accounted for in pre-season, and the time and space Bournemouth afforded United at Soldier Field is unlikely to be the same once the competitive action starts later this month.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",
      "Also full fixtures guide so you don't miss a game in what is set to be a thrilling season.",
      "Get your copy NOW",
      "Nevertheless, Yoro's performance was another one that offered plenty of encouragement and confidence. His showings towards the end of last season offered plenty of evidence to suggest United have a player with an extremely bright future on their hands.",
      "His opening two performances in the US have certainly backed up that theory and there is undoubtedly more to come from him. If he can avoid any injury issues this season, he will be an ever-present figure for Amorim.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, July 31.",
      "Those of you who decided to stay up overnight may well be feeling tired but shall be delighted with what you witnessed in Chicago. United continued their unbeaten start to pre-season with an exceptional 4-1 victory against AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring, before Patrick Dorgu, Amad and youngster Ethan Williams added gloss to the scoreline. The only blotch on the performance was an own goal from Matthijs de Ligt but it would do little to dampen the enthusiasm for that display.",
      "Away from pre-season, United's main focus is now a move for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko. The Reds are advancing their approach for the Slovenian after discovering that the pursuit of Ollie Watkins was unlikely to be fruitful.",
      "The determination to sign Sesko has led to questions over Hojlund's future which Amorim addressed in Chicago overnight.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below",
      "Manchester United are little over two weeks away from their Premier League curtain raiser against Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side know there's plenty of work to do before then and it's been another busy day in terms of transfer news and speculation.",
      "Here are your top stories this evening:",
      "Man Utd club shop BANS fans from printing names of three legends on back of kits",

      "Man United transfer plan coming together amid Benjamin Sesko wait",
      "Manchester United could be about to prove Alan Shearer right in the transfer window",
      "Manchester United may be handed an opportunity to sign an alternative to Benjamin Sesko - if they miss out on a deal for the Slovenia international - according to latest reports.",
      "Sesko has emerged as a primary striking target for United this summer as they look to add to their centre-forward options before the start of the new season. United have held a long-term interest in the 22-year-old, who rejected a switch to United in favour of RB Leipzig three years ago.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Manchester United could be set for a dream final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "United badly needed to fix their goal-scoring issues after netting an abysmal 44 goals in the Premier League last term. Chances were regularly squandered by United's attacking players, who all lacked the composure needed to convert goal-scoring opportunities.",
      "Those problems have been identified and seem to have been partly addressed with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Wolves' Matheus Cunha. And yet a truly top squad needs a reliable goal-scoring No.9, and that's why they are chasing a deal for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has the attributes that Rasmus Hojlund has lacked to succeed in the Premier League. Sesko's pace, strength in the air and composure could make him one of Europe's finest strikers.",
      "Attention should then turn towards a new midfielder with physical presence after Ruben Amorim's side were badly overrun in that department, for much of last season. Joao Palhinha would have fitted in well at Old Trafford, but the former Fulham player now looks set to join Tottenham Hotspur instead.",
      "You can read more here.",
      "Stuttgart CEO Alexander Wehrle has reiterated the Bundesliga club will only sell rising star Nick Woltemade if they receive an \"extraordinary\" offer to bring them to the transfer table.",
      "Bayern Munich had appeared to be the front-runners to sign the Germany U21 international, who shone during this summer's U21 European Championships. However, following Luis Diaz's move to Bayern, links with Woltemade have gone quiet.",
      "The Sun has claimed that Manchester United and Newcastle are ready to do battle to sign the 23-year-old, who is valued in the region of £40million. Both clubs are currently battling to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig as they prioritise a new striker ahead if the upcoming Premier League campaign.",
      "Despite those fresh links, Wehrle has reiterated Stuttgart's stance on a departure for Woltemade this summer. He told Münchner Merkur/Tz: \"I stand by what I said five weeks ago: We want to go into the next season with Nick - and if something extraordinary happens, we are ready to sit down at the table. Nothing has changed in that regard.\"",

      "Speaking to the Italian media, as realyed by Calciomercato.it, Comolli said:",
      "I think the club is very attractive; many agents and players are calling me. After all, we are Juventus, and we want to get back to winning ways.",

      "RB Leipzig may have just dropped a hint over the future of Manchester United transfer target Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United are in dire need of a reliable goalscoring striker after netting a meagre 44 goals in the Premier League last term - comfortably their lowest in a generation. Sesko and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins have been the No.9's most heavily linked in recent times.",
      "Amid speculation surrounding Sesko's future, his current club Leipzig have revealed their third kit for the forthcoming season - and the Slovenian striker is not seen in any of the pictures at the launch. The move is a possible indication that he may not be playing for them in 2025/26 - with the club unlikely to market the new kit with a player whose future remains uncertain.",

      "United are keen to offload the winger this summer as they aim to bolster their attacking line-up. It is thought that the ex-Borussia Dortmund player doesn't feature in United boss Ruben Amorim's long-term plans and is likely to depart from M16 once more.",

      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders at the disposal of head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is anticipated that United's plan to arrange a loan move for Collyer will pave the way for a new midfield signing.",

      "Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong has made a decision on his future after previous transfer links with Manchester United.",

      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United should prioritise a new goalkeeper next in the summer transfer window - but he's wrong.",
      "The Reds' current No.1, Andre Onana, has struggled badly at times since arriving at Old Trafford from Inter Milan in 2023. The Cameroonian was supposed to be an upgrade on a declining David de Gea and yet he has often cost United points rather than rescuing them.",
      "Every side with ambitions to be a top team needs a world-class goalkeeper between the sticks. Onana is clearly not that based on his performances at Old Trafford over the past two seasons.",

      "Whisper it quietly but Manchester United have looked quite good in their opening two games of their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "After a forgettable 0-0 draw against Leeds United in Stockholm a fortnight ago, the Reds have made significant strides since arriving in the US.",
      "As a result, United will be hoping to clinch the Premier League Summer Series trophy with a maximum points haul when they face Everton at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Sunday night.",
      "United made it two wins out of two with a comfortable 4-1 win over Bournemouth in midweek, getting the job done via goals from Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and substitute Ethan Williams.",
      "United played with a sense of purpose, producing a really encouraging performance. Although pre-season caveats have to be accounted for, their performance was energetic, vibrant and really encouraging.",
      "The tempo they set allowed them to move the ball with speed and a sense of conviction. One of the biggest criticisms they have faced in recent years has been for how uninspiring they have been to watch.",
      "Clearly adapting and becoming more and more familiar with Ruben Amorim's system, United's improved collective performances have raised the levels of several individuals. Patrick Dorgu, who arrived from Lecce in February, was particularly impressive against the Cherries, contributing a goal and an assist.",
      "With just two pre-season friendlies remaining, Amorim's team selections for the clashes with Everton and Fiorentina could provide a firm indication of the starting XI he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United have signed Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo so far this summer and are still hoping to bring in a goalkeeper, a midfielder and a striker, meaning Amorim's dream starting XI is still a few signings short of coming to fruition.",
      "Nevertheless, looking at the landscape of the squad as it is now, a crop of positions should be occupied by players the Portuguese chief already has available to him. Some positions have greater strength in depth than others, but that does not necessarily mean there isn't an obvious candidate to occupy top spot in the pecking order.",
      "Leny Yoro has been excellent in United's opening two games in the US, playing an excellent range of passes and demonstrating his hunger and ability to get on the ball and drive United up the pitch.",
      "The youngster is a shoo-in for the right-sided centre-back berth and will be one of the very first names on the teamsheet this season.",
      "In the wing-back department, Amad and Dorgu were both on target against Bournemouth. The latter has been superb in the opening two games of the tour and was involved in both of United's first half goals against the Cherries.",
      "Amorim wants his wing-backs to operate as wingers and occupy attacking positions. Dorgu did exactly that against Bournemouth and West Ham, pushing high up the pitch.",
      "Amad started as the right-sided No.10 against Bournemouth, but his starting position could change depending on what Amorim considers as Mbeumo's best position. The Cameroonian could feature for the first time this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was not on the scoresheet against Bournemouth, but his performance was just as influential. He regularly got on the ball in the centre of midfield and combined with Mason Mount and Amad in the No.10 berths.",
      "The Portuguese international is United's best player by some distance and will be a shoo-in for however long he remains at Old Trafford, meaning he could afford to have a dire pre-season and still make the team for the first competitive game of the season. His influence and importance is unrivalled.",
      "Fernandes linked up brilliantly with Cunha against West Ham and they will be hoping to develop a fruitful bond this season. The Brazilian has arrived from Wolves for £62.5million and has quickly demonstrated the sort of qualities he will bring to Old Trafford.",
      "His running power, technical ability and creativity levels inside the final third make him a guaranteed starter. He is also a natural fit for the left-sided No.10 spot.",
      "Mbeumo is yet to appear in pre-season so far, but the chances are he will join the list of undroppables once he's up to speed. The rest of the spots in the XI, however, are firmly up for grabs.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "If Manchester United's fortunes are going to change during Ruben Amorim's first season in charge of the club, a big indicator will be the form of Patrick Dorgu in his first full campaign.",
      "Amorim has been wedded to his 3-4-2-1 formation that brought him great success at Sporting CP but there have been teething issues when implementing it at Old Trafford.",
      "United chiefs have full faith in the Portuguese's methods and the thinking is that while United suffered short term pain last season - their 15th place finish was their worst ever Premier League campaign - the long term benefit of players getting to grips with Amorim's methods will be worth it in the long run.",
      "Amorim, of course, places huge importance on wing-backs and it was telling that his first signing in the January transfer window was Dorgu.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new away kit for the 2025/26 season, inspired by the club's early-1990s Adidas snowflake kit.",
      "United paid Italian side Lecce £30million to prise him from Serie A and despite United's struggles last term, there were some positive signs from the 20-year-old.",
      "And the Dane has made a strong start to pre-season, too, scoring in the 4-1 win over Bournemouth on United's tour of the USA.",
      "\"I feel like the pre-season is helping everyone to understand Ruben's ideas even more,\" Dorgu told club media after that win over the Cherries.",
      "\"The more training we have, the more we will grow into his ideas and I feel like it is being seen a little bit on the pitch already. We just keep improving.",
      "\"Every game is a chance to improve and be ready for Arsenal. Every game is important and we will just take it game by game.\"",
      "While pre-season is never the most reliable barometer to gauge a team's form, United have looked much better than they did last term.",
      "The players look like they understand Amorim's ideas more clearly and the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have given the whole club a lift.",
      "Whether Dorgu succeeds or fails at United this season will reflect hugely on how Amorim is viewed, given he was his first signing and is so important to the success of his much maligned system.",
      "The signs have been positive in the summer and Amorim will hope that continues into the Premier League later this month. If it does, with United not challenging on the European front next season, it could send a warning to their top flight rivals.",

      "Ruben Amorim will be desperate for a better season this time around as Manchester United look to bounce back from one of their worst top-flight performances for over 50 years. The focus at Old Trafford has been on solid recruitment after their signings in recent years failed to live up to expectations.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are the two newest faces through the door at the Theatre of Dreams and more are anticipated with Amorim keen on strengthening his side. Outgoings are also expected with the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho attracting interest.",
      "Marcus Rashford is among the high-profile departures this summer after he joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but United may be forced to offload more players in order to land reinforcements for the forthcoming season.",
      "The MEN has now examined the deals United could complete before the end of the transfer window, looking at the latest odds from bet365.",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "The MEN reported this week that United are advancing with a move for RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United have been looking to sign an out-and-out striker throughout the summer and were handed the bitter pill of rejection when Liam Delap opted for a move to Chelsea.",
      "Amorim's side and recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford have received encouragement over the pursuit of Sesko.",
      "However, they may not have a clear run at the Slovenian with Newcastle United also strongly linked. Bet365, though, have tipped United as the favourites to sign the 22-year-old at 2/7, ahead of the 5/2 Magpies.",
      "The market looks at which club the player will be at the beginning of September when the transfer window shuts and a stay at Leipzig is a long 12/1.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: Sesko is now at the top of United's wish list in their search for a striker, meaning he currently looks like the most likely candidate to come in and spearhead their attack.",
      "Signing a 22-year-old, who has no experience of playing in the Premier League, will be considered as a huge risk by some fans - and that is understandable after the Rasmus Hojlund experiment - but the Slovenian's record is more polished than Hojlund's was at the time of him joining United in 2023.",
      "Sesko has a high ceiling and could join an attack that has already been strengthened by the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo this summer. They will be able to assist with the goalscoring burden, easing the pressure on him.",
      "Christopher Nkunku",
      "The Chelsea striker has struggled to cement a starting place at Stamford Bridge, which has led to limited first-team opportunities for the Frenchman. His first season was plagued by injury and he was predominantly utilised off the bench during Enzo Maresca's debut campaign in 2024/25.",
      "The MEN reported in June that Nkunku was not a prime target in United's pursuit of a centre forward, amid the Londoners' interest in Garnacho.",
      "However, United have drifted in the market provided by Bet365 as they are now 10/1 shots for Nkunku's signature.",
      "The odds provided by the bookmaker suggest a return to Germany looks most likely with Bayern Munich leading the chase, priced at 7/2 with a return to Leipzig 4/1.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: United need an out-and-out centre-forward before the window shuts and Nkunku isn't one. By his own admission, he is at his best when playing behind the striker.",
      "United are well-stocked in the No.10 department, meaning they will not be eyeing anymore signings to fill that particular role this summer. Furthermore, the Chelsea attacker's record in the Premier League does little to inspire confidence; he has just six goals in 38 appearances.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin is currently a free agent after turning down a new contract at Everton. The forward has been previously linked with a move to Old Trafford during the height of his time at the Toffees.",
      "The 28-year-old looked like a concrete option at Old Trafford following United's failed pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap.",
      "However, with the pursuit of Sesko seemingly moving in the right direction, Bet365 have taken and broadened United's odds in the chase to 5/1.",
      "Newcastle and Aston Villa are the frontrunners at 2/1.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: Calvert-Lewin will be an attractive signing for a lot of clubs this summer, but he is not at the level United need him to be. He has played in the Premier League for nine seasons and has only reached double figures for goals twice - the last time being in 2020/21.",
      "The former Sheffield United man scored just three goals in 27 league games last season, meaning he is not the reliable goalscorer United need. Even on a free transfer, United should be steering well clear.",
      "Emi Martinez",
      "Manchester United have had misfortune between the sticks in recent years with Andre Onana coming under fire for several high-profile mistakes.",
      "United have been linked with a sensational move for Aston Villa shot-stopper and World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emi Martinez in recent months. The Argentine was heavily tipped to move to Saudi Arabia but those reports seem to have settled slightly, however Amorim's side continue to be linked with goalkeeping reinforcements despite priorities seemingly lying elsewhere.",
      "Although, Bet365 consider an Aston Villa stay as his most likely destination after the transfer window closes, with their odds as short as 1/2 compared to United's 7/4.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: Like most goalkeepers, Martinez has a mistake in him, as highlighted when he clattered Hojlund on the final day of the Premier League season at Old Trafford in May.",
      "However, he has been one of the best goalkeepers in the business over the last few years and would be an upgrade on Onana. Signing him, though, would be dependent on Villa's valuation and moving Onana on.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma",
      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma but Bet365 still consider the Champions League winners as leading contenders to retain the services of the shot-stopper.",
      "The Italian is into the final 12 months of his contract in the French capital and Luis Enrique's side are said to be close to signing Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "Bet365 have touted United as 3/1 contenders while Chelsea sit behind them at 7/1. A stay at PSG is a very short 8/15.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: The Italian is one of the best goalkeepers in the world and would be an excellent signing for United. He has been excellent for Paris Saint-Germain over the last few years.",
      "Having kept seven clean sheets to help PSG win the Champions League last season, it is hard to imagine him being prepared to give up Champions League football for a campaign without any form of European football at Old Trafford.",
      "Ollie Watkins",
      "Ollie Watkins was an option for United as one of their targets for an out-and-out striker but, with Aston Villa adamant that he was not for sale, they were forced to look elsewhere.",
      "The England Euro 2024 semi-final hero has been fiercely linked with a move away from Villa Park in the last 12 months, facing speculation over a move to Arsenal in January.",
      "However, United have drifted slightly in the market with their interest in Sesko progressing - potentially at Newcastle's expense.",
      "Bet365 have moved the Magpies ahead of United to 2/1 contenders, compared to Amorim's side who are now 6/1. But a Villa Park stay remains the most likely outcome according to the bookmakers at 4/6.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: Watkins, despite never scoring 20 goals or more in a Premier League season in his career, has always been a reliable marksman. He is Premier League proven and would tie in with United's theme of raiding Wolves and Brentford for their star players already this summer.",
      "Watkins, who scored 16 goals for Villa in the league last season, has scored 75 goals over the last five Premier League campaigns, reaching double figures on every occasion. His best season in front of goal was when he plundered 19 goals in 2023/24.",
      "Although Villa are currently refusing to entertain the idea of selling him, United could do far worse than turning to him if their pursuit of Sesko fails.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho",
      "Chelsea are long-standing admirers of Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho and a report from The Telegraph claimed that the Londoners have no concerns over the character of their target.",
      "The Argentine faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after being one of five first-teamers to express a desire to leave Amorim's side.",
      "Bet365 do see a possibility of Garnacho staying within the Portuguese's set-up and have priced him at 9/4 to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea are 4/11 contenders and lead the race to sign him, according to the bookmakers.",
      "Manchester United writer George Smith says: Garnacho is one of the most talented players in United's squad, and that is the reason he has already played almost 150 games for the club by the age of 21.",
      "However, he doesn't fit Amorim's wingerless system and his attitude has been called into question once too often. United are right to try and get him off the books.",

      "A cluster of big-name strikers have been on the move this summer, several of which had been linked with moves to Old Trafford, such as Viktor Gyokeres, Hugo Ekitike, Victor Osimhen and Delap. Sesko is one of the last big-name strikers available.",
      "Although he is only 22 and still has plenty to prove, he boasts a respectable record for a striker of his age, scoring 90 career goals at club level in senior football. He joined RB Leipzig in the 2023 summer transfer window and has scored 39 goals in 87 games for the German outfit.",
      "Described as a striker with \"enormous potential\" by United recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who previously worked at Leipzig, Sesko has been attracting attention for several years. United first expressed interest in him in the summer of 2022.",
      "Despite only turning 22 at the end of May, Sesko has already established himself as Slovenia's chief striker. He has 16 goals in 41 caps for his country and started each of their four matches at the 2024 European Championship.",
      "Although he was unable to get himself on the scoresheet in Germany, former Newcastle United and England striker Alan Shearer was encouraged by his performances at the tournament, backing him to end up in the Premier League sooner rather than later.",

      "Also attracting interest from Newcastle United, Sesko has cemented himself at the top of United's wish list amid their desperate need for a reliable goalscorer.",
      "United have finished each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference and know they can ill-afford to end the window without the addition of a new chief marksman. Rasmus Hojlund regressed last season and Joshua Zirkzee is not a striker.",

Both the United academy graduates are in new pastures after leaving Old Trafford - with the former leaving for Barcelona on loan this summer.",
      "Lingard, 32, now plies his trade in South Korea with FC Seoul and, on Thursday, the La Liga champions ran-out 7-3 winners against them. Rashford was introduced at half-time, while his former United teammate played 81 minutes before he was replaced as Lamine Yamal made headlines with a brace.",
      "The two ex-United stars were seen sharing time together after the full-time whistle and laughing together as they caught up. Lingard then posted a carousel of pictures on to his Instagram, including some with Rashford, Hansi Flick and Yamal with a fingers crossed emoji and a red heart emoji as the caption.",
      "Pogba was then among those to show support in the comments, and took the opportunity to share a heartfelt message, which read: \"Rasha x jlings I miss you my guys.\"",
      "The 32-year-old Lingard has scored seven goals in 24 appearances, providing three assists in the K-League in his second season at the club.",

      "United are keen to offload the winger this summer as they aim to bolster their attacking line-up. It is thought that the ex-Borussia Dortmund player doesn't feature in United boss Ruben Amorim's long-term plans and is likely to depart from M16 once more.",

      "Manchester United are ‘confident’ they will beat Premier League rivals Newcastle United to the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, according to reports.",
      "The Magpies and Red Devils are both incredibly interested in signing the Slovenian international, with Leipzig reportedly asking for £65million guaranteed, plus add-ons and a percentage of a future sale.",
      "Newcastle quickly identified Sesko as their top choice to replace wantaway striker Alexander Isak, who is wanted by Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "United, meanwhile, want to recruit a new centre-forward after another difficult season for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side have also been linked with Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins, but appear to have picked the 22-year-old as their top striker target.",
      "MORE: Five desperate Man Utd transfers to follow £69m Benjamin Sesko signing as Chelsea, Aston Villa profit",
      "They might have been inadvertently boosted on Friday, with Newcastle turning down a £110m bid from Liverpool for Isak.",
      "Liverpool are not expected to make a second bid for the 25-year-old Sweden striker, who did not travel to Asia for Newcastle’s pre-season tour.",
      "It’s unlikely that the Geordies will sign Sesko if Isak isn’t sold, though Eddie Howe does want to sign another striker. Brentford’s Yoane Wissa is a target, but the Bees have told Newcastle he’ll cost at least £50m.",
      "If Newcastle are no longer in the race to sign the Leipzig youngster, then United will have a free run at him and will become the strong favourites to win the race for his signature.",
      "Even before it emerged that Liverpool won’t return with an improved offer for Isak, it was reported by United in Focus correspondent Graeme Bailey that there is an ‘internal confidence’ at Old Trafford that ‘they are set to win the chase for Sesko’.",
      "Indeed, Bailey claims that Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Red Devils are ‘very happy with how talks have gone in recent days’, though ‘they will not get ahead of themselves’.",
      "Bailey told United in Focus: “During their talks Sesko confirmed that a lack of Champions League football this season was not a problem to him as the long-term project and the chance to work with Ruben Amorim were the major draws.",
      "“I can also reveal that United made it clear to Sesko’s people that they are aware of the size of deal that would be required to land him and that they would not have entered into talks without that consideration.",
      "“United are confident, there is no denying that but they are waiting – they also know that Newcastle have put forward a very strong case.”",
      "Even without Champions League football, United are still able to lure the brightest of talents. Newcastle, meanwhile, are in disarray, but are willing to offer Isak a new contract.",
      "As well as negotiating for Sesko, United are working on player sales, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia all available.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is reportedly excited at the prospect of Benjamin Sesko joining with the Red Devils ‘very optimistic’ a deal will get done.",
      "Man Utd have told RB Leipzig their ‘formal bid’ for Sesko is ready but Amorim is clashing with INEOS over the Red Devils’ striker plans this summer.",
      "Man Utd will have no wriggle room once they cave and spend £69m on Benjamin Sesko, so they could easily finish this window with five desperate transfers…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s ‘spending is to continue’ after landing Benjamin Sesko as they will turn their attention to a new top target.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has offered Man Utd a huge boost in their bid to sign Benjamin Sesko as RB Leipzig “dream” of a swap deal for a ‘damned’ Red Devils star.",
      "Romano has explained why he thinks players are “scared” to sign for Newcastle as top target Benjamin Sesko makes his ‘final transfer decision’."

      "Chelsea are bidding to be the world’s biggest spenders in the summer window for the fourth consecutive season, but Liverpool and maybe even Arsenal want a word.",
      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £102.54m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £122.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",

      "15) 🆕 Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Aston Villa\nThe Spain international has also been linked with Newcastle but it’s Villa being mentioned as a potential destination for Aghehowa. One problem: Porto are using the Viktor Gyokeres fee as a benchmark and they want £55million. Which is more a less one whole Ollie Watkins.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",
      "",
      "13) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "12) 🔽 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted. But Man Utd’s interest complicates matters. The worst-case summer scenario for Newcastle could become a grim reality.",

      "10) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid. We suspect this will come down to the player’s preference: stay in the Premier League, or a gap season or two in Europe?",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",
      "",
      "8) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. The deal is dropping down our power ranking, but we’re refusing to rule it out completely…",

The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Manchester United\nOn Wednesday morning, we were told that Watkins was the priority; by Wednesday evening, it’s Sesko. As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. And Newcastle’s boost is still United’s boost. If Isak is staying at St James’, they should get a free run at Sesko…",

      "1) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, Ramsdale is having a medical on Thursday before the Toon pay £4million to borrow him for the season with the option of a more permanent arrangement.",

      "While we do consider ourselves members of the ‘away kit colours are a free-for-all’ tribe in that particular war, that doesn’t mean we aren’t as partial as the next kit obsessive to the beguiling simplicity of simply inverting the colours of the home kit.",

We don’t hate metallic or neon detailing on a black shirt, but there’s something to be said for leaning into the monochrome simplicity, and Nike have done that beautifully here.",

The light blue pinstripes pop beautifully between the stripes/panels/whatever, and the elegance with which the umbro mark and Bournemouth badge sit within the two blue stripes is just very lovely indeed.",
      "And while we’re on the subject: just look at that badge. We are suckers for a club crest re-rendered in the appropriate colourway for an away kit and this is just an absolutely fabulous example of it. More excellent use here of that lighter blue that really pulls the whole kit together.",

The vibrant yellow and navy is a classic Tottenham change kit colourway, the Total 90 template remains sensational even if we do find the very idea that anything from a year beginning with a ‘2’ might now be considered fair game for raking in the retro-nostalgia coin slightly uncomfortable.",
      "We already wake up every morning with at least three new aches and pains; we really didn’t need any further reminders of our own march to decrepitude and the freewheeling passing of time.",
      "Where were we? Yeah. Cracking kit. Lovely old Spurs badge from the before times when we could put socks on standing up. But look where they’ve put that badge. It’s in the middle, isn’t it? Where it shouldn’t be, and with the Nike swoosh all the way out on the breast.",
      "We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: if you must deploy a central club crest, you simply must also centralise the maker’s mark. It’s a basic question of balance. This example of this unacceptably frequent misstep upsets more than most, given the otherwise 10/10 shirt they’ve decided to slightly spoil for simply no good reason.",

      "We like this one a lot, especially for the clever use of the ‘snowflake’ imprint. It’s a motif whose association with United goes all the way back to that belting early ’90s away kit, and a design adidas have since leant on for United with even more enthusiasm than they have Arsenal and the lightning bolt. They even did it last season and have gone back to the well again.",
      "But if it works, it works. And what they’ve done for United here that maybe isn’t quite so true of the (nevertheless strikingly excellent) Arsenal away kit is do something new and different with it. In this case that means making it all massive.",

      "It is so, so much better than last year’s away kit when, instead of drawing inspiration from a beloved Arsenal kit from the past a rare yet gigantic mis-step from the Germans saw them instead influenced by a bottle of Lynx Africa.",
      "The only minor grumble one could reasonably have here is the similarity to a third kit Arsenal had a few years ago, and thus the fact that this shirt could be argued to represent the running out of ideas, with adidas leaning on the lightning bolt motif yet again on yet another retro-inspired Arsenal shirt.",
      "To this we say: Yeah, whatever, just look at it. It is lovely. And that’s the real quiz.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "13) Victor Osimhen – £64.8m/€75m (Napoli to Galatasaray, July 2025)\nA decent haul of 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games on loan inspired Galatasaray to a league and cup double while convincing them Osimhen was entirely worth absolutely obliterating a Turkish transfer record which had previously stood at around €20m.",
      "",
      "14) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "15) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "16) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "17) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "18) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "19) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "20) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",

      "These five English youngsters are set to move clubs this summer. But where are they going? Well, we’ve tried to predict that, with Tottenham Hotspur snapping up two starlets…",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\n“I don’t really want to be wasting years on my career because it’s a short career. I just want to improve and be the best possible version of myself. If that’s to go somewhere else, then it’s a decision that I’m going to have to make.”",
      "That’s Liverpool attacking midfielder Harvey Elliott earlier this summer. The club’s signing of Florian Wirtz does the 22-year-old no favours, while Hugo Ekitike is another signing to contend with out wide. Luis Diaz has left, but then Alexander Isak is coming in. The writing is on the wall for the Under-21 European Championship’s Player of the Tournament.",
      "We are well over a month on from the acceptance that Elliott will leave Anfield this summer, yet there has been a concerning lack of movement. He was a big name at the start of the window but it’s gone pretty quiet. We said he’d be ‘perfect’ for Manchester United, but there’s no chance that happens. Then you have West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur. The London clubs are being linked more than others, while Newcastle United – who have more alarming priorities – are in the picture.",
      "After missing out on Nottingham Forest’s Morgan Gibbs-White, Tottenham should go all in on Elliott. They need a creative spark in midfield, and more depth in the middle of the park in general. The Liverpool youngster has the versatility to play in a midfield three, behind the striker, or on either wing. Thomas Frank has plenty of depth in wide areas, but James Maddison’s injury record is concerning, and Dejan Kulusevski – who’s also struggled with injuries this year – is naturally a winger.",
      "So, yes, a transfer to Spurs makes sense. Not just for the club, but for Elliott. If he moves there, he’ll still have Champions League football and a platform to become an England regular. Competition for places in Thomas Frank’s midfield is fierce, but from what Elliott has shown us, we’re confident that he’s good enough.",

      "",
      "James McAtee (Manchester City)\nReports suggest that Man City want Cole Palmer money for James McAtee. Considering they massively underpriced the former, we can’t blame them. Now worth over £100million on Transfermarkt and surely not available for anything below £180m, Palmer joined Chelsea for around £40m in September 2023.",
      "Palmer played 41 times (12 starts) for the Cityzens, scoring six and assisting two. Nobody could foresee what the 23-year-old would become at Chelsea, which means it’s unfair to completely disregard McAtee – 34 appearances and seven goals for City – as capable of reaching a similar level. They are both young, English attacking midfielders, who will leave having been unable to repeat Phil Foden’s success. It’s hardly an easy task considering how much City invest on players.",
      "While it’s unfair to disregard McAtee as a potential Palmer, it’s difficult to envision him moving to a ‘Big Six’ rival, besides Spurs, who, as we’ve said, want to bring in a creative midfielder. Aston Villa could be a good fit if Morgan Rogers or Jacob Ramsey leaves, but they are clearly working with a very limited budget and won’t be spending £40m on McAtee.",
      "We really like the Bundesliga links, and as things stand, a move to Germany seems the most likely. Borussia Dortmund are being linked but recently signed Jobe Bellingham and are now looking for a more natural wide player after selling Jamie Gittens to Chelsea. Then you have long-time admirers Bayer Leverkusen, on top of Stuttgart and Eintracht Frankfurt. Stuttgart finished ninth last season, making them the only club on that list not in the Champions League.",
      "The Bundesliga has proven to be an incredible springboard for English talent and McAtee surely knows that. Leverkusen are a good fit and say what you like about Erik ten Hag, he’s done some excellent work with young players in his managerial career.",
      "",
      "Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nThere’s no shame in failing at Chelsea. Especially as a young player. They sign so many players that it’s difficult to keep up. Plenty of promising youngsters will be regretting choosing the Stamford Bridge project, and Chukwuemeka is one of them.",
      "There was strong competition for the midfielder’s signature when it became clear he’d leave Aston Villa for around £15m in the 2022 summer transfer window. Every top club, and Manchester United, wanted him, but it was Chelsea that won the race and since then, the 21-year-old has scored twice in 32 matches for the Londoners, starting a bleak five times.",
      "Chukwuemeka, like McAtee, seems destined for a move abroad. He’s already had a taste, spending the second half of last season on loan at Dortmund. He scored on his only Bundesliga start and was only an unused substitute twice during his time in Germany, which is…something.",
      "In order to fulfil his potential, the ex-Villa youngster should leave the Premier League, but his Dortmund spell hints that a Europa League or Conference League outfit could be the way to go. Recommending RB Leipzig completely contradicts that, but that’s what we’re doing. The important thing is, they surely won’t miss out on Europe again this season.",
      "Leipzig have a proven track record of developing young talents. Just look at Xavi Simons and Benjamin Sesko. Both are set to move clubs for a combined ~£130m this summer. Chukwuemeka should become the second Englishman to play for Red Bull FC after Emile Smith Rowe.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nIt’s fair to say Mainoo is ‘available’. He’s not ‘up for sale’ or anything of the sort, but United would listen to offers for their academy graduate to help ease their Profit and Sustainability worries. The 20-year-old holds the pure profit key, which doesn’t just unlock the ability to reinvest, but also unlocks the part of the brain that makes you think it’s okay to sell your most promising youngster and someone who’s been at the club since they were seven to sign someone from abroad. Don’t tell Matt Law.",
      "Mainoo was one of the very few positives for the Red Devils in 2023/24, until they won the FA Cup, which was quite a big positive. His breakout season was fantastic and a reason for the miserable Old Trafford faithful to be optimistic. Last season was less fruitful for the young midfielder, despite a big Euro 2024 with England. Still, United shouldn’t be considering cashing in. But, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. And Manchester United are a circus.",
      "Chelsea? The upside is gargantuan, but the downside is career-threatening. We don’t want their bloated squad to completely bugger Mainoo’s development. Yet, there’s a strong chance he could go there and become one of the world’s leading midfielders.",
      "And then there’s Spurs. Yes, these guys again. Not Real Madrid, who Defensa Central reckon are interested. Mainoo is more of a box-to-box midfielder than a creative one, or even a deep-lying No.6. Frank loves energy and Mainoo can bring that in abundance. It shouldn’t be a case of ‘Elliott or Mainoo?’ for the Londoners; they can get both and give them the playing time they want.",
      "",
      "Tyler Morton (Liverpool)\nWe’ll truly find out if young Morton is available in due course, with Lyon reportedly keen on signing him from Liverpool. Should the Reds reject the French side’s offer, it will become clear that he’s not for sale, or that the club’s asking price has not been met.",
      "There have been Club Brugge, Braga, Celtic, Ajax and West Ham links but Lyon’s interest is serious. They’ve just lost a key midfield figure in Jordan Veretout and are clearly impressed by the 22-year-old’s Under-21 European Championship campaign with England. He played five of the Young Lions’ six games as they went back-to-back, assisting in the final victory over old foes Germany.",
      "He has also spent time on loan at Hull City and Blackburn Rovers in the Championship, with opportunities at Anfield hard to come by. He has 14 appearances, which shows he hasn’t been completely ignored, but it’s definitely time to move on and become a regular for a top-flight team.",
      "Lyon can provide him with that platform and with only a year left on his Liverpool contract, might get a deal done for a very decent price.",
      "READ NEXT: Liverpool 2) and 7) in top 11(?!) best Premier League transfer windows ever",

      "Manchester United’s continued struggles in the transfer market under INEOS have put head coach Ruben Amorim in a precarious position. There is much left to do in the final weeks of this summer’s transfer window, which has not brought about the level of seismic change required after last season’s misery.",
      "Their two marquee signings, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, dramatically improve United‘s No.10 department and the same can be said up front once Benjamin Sesko joins the Red Devils after ‘making his final decision’ to snub Newcastle United.",
      "All that remains is for United chiefs to settle on a price with RB Leipzig and while they are ‘hoping’ to pay €70m (£60m) rather than €80m (£69m), the prolonged prelude to them buckling to Brentford for Mbeumo suggests they will cave again and agree to pay the larger fee for their desired striker.",
      "Man Utd would likely have no qualms about paying the set fee for Sesko were they to recoup funds through player sales, but their blatant desperation to offload members of their bomb squad (and baffling £160m valuation) has been their undoing, as most remain in the building.",
      "After United’s recruitment team set out a pre-summer plan to fund signings through the sales of outcasts, it is looking increasingly likely that more dispensable stars will follow Barcelona newbie Marcus Rashford in leaving on loan as a last resort.",
      "And with two signing priorities remaining after Sesko, the loan market could be the only solution for INEOS as these five potential transfers represent an underwhelming end to the window for the Premier League giants…",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho to Chelsea (loan with buy option)\nSo much for Man Utd getting £70m for Garnacho…",
      "The 21-year-old is one of the few current United stars who hold value, though that is due to his huge potential and not the dire form/attitude that derailed his 2024/25 campaign.",
      "It is easy to foresee Garnacho, like Rashford, shining in a new environment, but Man Utd and Amorim’s very public stance on his future has impacted their negotiating power, as even the most sellable of their bomb squad is yet to secure a move elsewhere.",
      "Still, Garnacho is not without interest and this saga reeks of a club capitalising on Man Utd softening their stance on his exit in the final days of this window, and said team could be Chelsea after he passed ‘background checks’ in a repeat of last summer’s deal for Jadon Sancho as they remain interested, despite already being flooded with attacking options.",

      "David Ornstein’s inferior, Fabrizio Romano, has revealed that Man Utd are unwilling to “spend money” on a new goalkeeper as they prioritise Sesko, so it makes sense that Pope’s name has been brought up and he would be a safe pair of hands in the short term.",
      "But it’s hard to see him dislodging Andre Onana as United’s No.1 at a time when a new starter is required after the Cameroon international’s shambolic fall to calamity after a steady debut season. An up-and-coming goalkeeper or even Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez would be a better fit than 33-year-old Pope to fix this glaring weak spot.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho to Aston Villa (loan)\nOne of many mistakes made by Man Utd last summer was to give Chelsea an easy out in a clause to send Sancho back to Old Trafford for a measly £5m, which was a no-brainer to activate after his uninspiring stint at Stamford Bridge.",
      "This means Man Utd are back to square one with Sancho after a season apart, and this is becoming an increasingly common pattern at the club as the decision-makers settle on loan-to-buy deals to kick their problems down the road for next year.",
      "Sancho’s mixed spell at Chelsea – but particularly his huge salary – leaves him waiting until the close of the window for a solution.",
      "Aston Villa, as they did with Rashford, could follow up their interest and offer him sanctuary away from Old Trafford, but only on an initial loan before a possible free transfer in 2026, as their board know what they are doing.",
      "Alternatively, he could return to Dortmund after making a ‘sacrifice’.",
      "",
      "Antony to Real Betis (loan with buy option)\nThe £80m flop is United’s fifth-worst signing since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, but he headed into this summer as a hot commodity following his remarkable 14-goal involvement stint at Real Betis, in which he came close to matching his overall tally of 17 for the Red Devils in 70 (yes, SEVENTY) fewer matches.",
      "From United being unlikely to attract £10m bids for Antony to their £30m valuation being fully justified amid shock Bayern Munich interest, it was quite the turnaround for Antony, though his future remains unsettled.",
      "Rumblings on Antony’s future have been limited, yet he has recently ‘rejected two offers’ to leave as he and Real Betis seem content in the knowledge that they want to reunite this summer.

      "Mainoo struggled in an injury-impacted 2024/25 campaign after his sensational breakout season in 2023/24 and he has attracted interest from Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Earlier this month, a report claimed Spurs have made contact with Man Utd over signing Mainoo, but it currently seems that he is unlikely to leave his boyhood club.",
      "After opening the door to his exit in the winter window, a report from Football Insider claims Man Utd have ‘made a transfer U-turn’ on the centre-midfielder, while former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown reckons they were “crazy” to “consider letting him go”.",

And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",

      "",
      "3) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "4) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",

      "Manchester United are ‘in talks’ with Paris Saint-Germain to complete a stunning summer signing, with the ‘process ON’ to complete the deal.",
      "The Red Devils are looking to sign a new goalkeeper in the off-season after Andre Onana failed to convince last term, and Gianluigi Donnarumma has emerged a surprise option in the last few days as the trail to Aston Villa’s Emiliano Martinez has gone cold.",
      "The Italian – valued by Transfermarkt at €40m [£34m] – is said to be assessing his options this this summer as he enters the last 12 months of his deal, with PSG closing in on the signing of Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier.",
      "Fabrizio Romano wrote on X on Tuesday: ‘Paris Saint-Germain are at final stages of Lucas Chevalier deal, here we go soon!",
      "‘€40m [£35m] deal being sorted directly between presidents Al Khelaifi and Letang as Lille ask for more add-ons, but very close. Chevalier accepted a five year deal last week.’",
      "PSG want to avoid losing Donnarumma for nothing next summer, and amid reported interest from Chelsea and other suitors, a report on Wednesday claimed United are now the ‘frontrunners’ for the 26-year-old’s signature and that ‘in the last few hours their chances have increased significantly’.",
      "When asked about reported Man Utd interest in Donnarumma, Romano added: “I’m not aware of movements at this stage. Man United want a new goalkeeper but the numbers have to be right.”",
      "The transfer expert has now claimed that there’s still a chance the Italy international will remain at the Parcs des Princes.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Gigio Donnarumma and his camp do not rule out to stay at Paris Saint-Germain. Even with contract expiring in June 2026 and Chevalier coming soon, Gigio could stay and compete for his spot as he did with Navas… …and then, decide his future in the next months.’",
      "But former footballer turned journalist Jan Aage Fjørtoft insists United are making progress in their bid to land Donnarumma.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Donnarumma and Manchester United There were some reports yesterday that this was a non-starter. That’s not correct! Just been told that this process is ON. There are talks going on.’",
      "Paris-based journalist Fabrice Hawkins previously explained how United were just one of several clubs interested in the Italy shot stopper.",
      "On Monday, he said: “Gianluigi Donnarumma has not yet left, even though his agents are exploring the market to find him a new destination.",
      "“The Italian goalkeeper has options. Manchester United, Manchester City, Galatasaray, and Saudi clubs are interested. However, he remains attached to PSG and will only leave if a project fully suits him.",
      "“Internally, the possibility of seeing Chevalier and Donnarumma compete, with Luis Enrique making the final decision, is not ruled out.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the truth about rumours that Man Utd could sign Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly now the ‘frontrunners’ to sign PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma this summer after James Trafford returned to Man City.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have a ‘real chance’ of making a ‘stunning move’ for Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have picked out their ‘next big target’ after landing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly ‘decided to sell’ a ‘top name’ on Manchester United’s ‘shortlist’ to replace a current starter at Old Trafford.",
      "Man City have made a ‘concrete move’ to sign a Chelsea target but ‘want to keep’ Ederson despite the goalkeeper agreeing personal terms with Galatasaray."

      "Thursday 31 July 2025 07:57, UK",
      "Manchester United have held initial talks with RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has emerged as a top target for Manchester United in this window if they sign a striker.",
      "Exploratory talks have also been held with Sesko's representatives and it is understood that while Manchester United are keen to sign him, it will not be a simple deal to do financially.",
      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",
      "However, the prices and structure for those players have been deemed too high at this stage.",
      "While Sesko would cost more than Watkins overall, it's thought a more favourable structure could be struck with Leipzig.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund responded to Man Utd's interest in Sesko by scoring the opening goal in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth on Thursday.",

      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",

      "Wednesday 30 July 2025 17:11, UK",
      "Manchester United have made Benjamin Sesko their top transfer target - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "The 22-year-old was wanted by Arsenal earlier in the transfer window but Manchester United are now interested after the Gunners moved for Viktor Gyokeres - who used to be managed by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford?",
      "And with a release clause between £68m and £86m, could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",

      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "Like Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, Sesko could help add counter-attacking threat to a Manchester United side that only scored four fast-break goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness might be part of his appeal to Manchester United.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "It is likely another part of his appeal to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to Old Trafford would bring considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United."

      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",

      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",

      "Work has been done to explore potential deals for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is another player the club have looked at, but Chelsea's valuation of the striker is understood to be considered far too high.",
      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",

      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",

      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",
