      "The duo were travelling near the city of Zamora close to the Portuguese border when a tyre on their Lamborghini blew out while overtaking another vehicle. The car burst into flames and both men lost their lives.",
      "Jota was beginning his journey back to Liverpool via Santander for pre-season having been advised to travel by ferry rather than plane due to a recent lung surgery.",
      "United enjoy a storied rivalry with Liverpool and paid their own tributes to Jota on their website.",
      "\"Manchester United’s deepest condolences are with the loved ones of Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre, and everyone connected with Liverpool FC following Thursday’s heartbreaking news,\" they posted.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes, an international teammate of Jota, added: \"Friend, colleague, and companion in a thousand battles. It’s hard to understand how it’s possible for someone to leave so soon.",
      "“May you and your brother find the peace you need to look after those who lost you so suddenly and so soon. My condolences to all your family.”",

      "Nemanja Vidic has expressed his ambition to take the helm at Manchester United someday.",
      "Signed by Sir Alex Ferguson back in December 2005 for £7million, Vidic turned out to be a bargain as he rose to prominence as one of the top defenders in the Premier League.",
      "During his trophy-laden stint in Manchester, Vidic celebrated winning 15 major honours, among them five Premier League crowns, before Louis van Gaal showed him the door following a dip in performance and injury woes.",
      "The Serbian ace hung up his boots after an 18-month spell with Inter Milan, with persistent injuries calling time on his playing days.",
      "Although Vidic has previously discussed delving into coaching, his main focus currently is his family, especially with three young kids at home.",
      "Nevertheless, Vidic admits to harbouring managerial dreams at the hallowed Old Trafford ground.",
      "\"If I was to manage or coach anyone, it would have to be Manchester United,\" he disclosed on The Overlap. \"I like things when they're difficult and to change something from difficult to good, this is something I like to do.\"",
      "Considering his immediate future, Vidic said: \"I'm open an opportunity to be a coach, or to work in football as a Sporting Director, or even the Serbian President of the FA – that was the plan a few years ago – it didn't happen but maybe it could happen in the future.\"",
      "Vidic went on to open up about his ventures off the pitch and how his drive for excellence transcends into business.",
      "He said: \"Obviously, what I'm doing outside [of football], business wise, creating a company which is going to be not just successful but is going to be who I am as well.",
      "\"Everything I do, I like to do the best I can, and to produce the quality. In the business I'm doing now, with the apartments, that's what I'm trying to achieve as well. To create good apartments and nice buildings, which I'm going to be proud walking in, and being proud of what I've built.\"",
      "The ex-United star discussed the difficult side of fatherhood, especially when it comes to watching his son follow in his footsteps. He added: \"It's difficult watching my son play football because he's playing centre-back and I see everything in terms of what he can do better.",
      "\"I'm the type of person that when they see, they have to say – I can't keep it to myself. He's learning now to accept that but it's good. I like watching him when I see his improvement and in the last year, he has improved a lot.\"",
      "He also reflected on the family atmosphere at home and the subject of footballing expectations placed on his children.",
      "\"In my house, we don't really talk much about football,\" Vidic said. \"We don't talk about how many trophies I won – I'm not much in the media. People are always saying, 'Your son has pressure' – I don't think he has any pressure. He has an advantage.",
      "\"Everyone knows who his dad is and the first thing they are going to do is compare and see how good he is. So, people will come to watch you, and if you are good, you are good.\""

      "Benni McCarthy has shed light on Jadon Sancho's struggles at Manchester United, suggesting that his introverted nature was misinterpreted as having a bad attitude. Sancho was signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73million after a lengthy transfer saga.",
      "However, he failed to replicate his form from Germany at Old Trafford, scoring a mere 12 goals during his hugely underwhelming stint with the club.",
      "He later fell out with then-Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag in September 2023 over his commitment levels in training and refused to apologise for publicly criticising the Dutchman's comments on social media. That led to him being frozen out from the first-team squad.",
      "It also resulted in the 25-year-old being loaned out twice in succession, first to Dortmund and then to Chelsea last season. Although he didn't make a significant impact at Stamford Bridge, he did score in the Europa Conference League final victory.",
      "At the end of the 2024/25 season, Chelsea opted to pay United a £5m fee rather than fulfilling their obligation-to-buy clause and signing the winger permanently for £25m.",
      "Current United head coach Ruben Amorim has shown no signs of wanting to bring the Englishman back into the fold, indicating that Sancho is likely to leave this summer as a failed signing.",
      "Now, McCarthy, who served as a first-team coach under Ten Hag for two years from the summer of 2022 to 2024, has come out in support of Sancho's character. The South African, currently managing Kenya's national team, says he wasn’t the most sociable team-mate at United and would often head straight home after training, which may have been misconstrued from the outside.",
      "McCarthy told betonlinepromocodes.com: “I couldn’t fault Jadon in training. He brings unbelievable quality, ability and skills. He can make you stop in awe and ask yourself just how he can do things. He brought unmatched quality.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates. He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.\"",
      "However, he went on to comment on Sancho’s main struggles with consistency, adding: “I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best everyday. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him, he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho might be on the verge of a permanent exit from Manchester this summer. Juventus have been linked with the Englishman and reports suggest they could be ready to meet United's valuation of around £25m.",
      "But the Turin-based club are not willing to do the same for Sancho's hefty wage demands, which reportedly exceed £300,000 per week as talks continue with his representatives. A swap deal could be on the cards too",
      "It's claimed that the Italians have offered Douglas Luiz, Tim Weah and Dusan Vlahovic to sweeten a deal for Sancho. United reportedly have not yet responded to that proposal and could prefer straight cash amid attempts to boost Amorim's budget.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "A free agent who idolised Ryan Giggs when he was at Manchester United is reportedly eager to join Wrexham. Welsh international Tom Lawrence is currently unattached after his contract with Scottish club Rangers expired at the end of last season.",
      "The attacking midfielder, born in Wrexham, was plagued by injuries following his move from Derby County to Ibrox in 2022. Despite the setbacks, the 31-year-old managed to make 65 appearances and netted 11 goals during his three-year stint in Glasgow.",
      "He's now on the hunt for a new club, with Wrexham, owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, said to be interested in acquiring his services. While Lawrence has reportedly attracted interest from clubs in the Middle East and Turkey, the Mail reports that the prospect of playing for his hometown club is an appealing one.",
      "The Red Dragons, who clinched promotion from League One to the Championship in April, have already signed one local talent in the summer transfer window. The North Wales outfit announced the signing of goalkeeper Danny Ward on a two-year deal on Tuesday, following his release from Leicester City.",
      "If they manage to secure Lawrence's signature, Wrexham would be adding a player who honed his skills under some of the best in the business during his time at Manchester United.",
      "He joined the Premier League heavyweights at just seven-years-old and had the privilege of learning from Manchester United legends such as Sir Sir Alex Ferguson and Paul Scholes, as well as his hero Giggs.",
      "Highlighting the impact this had on him in an interview last year, Lawrence told the Sun: \"I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. So the number of figures that helped me out along the way, I couldn't name them all.",
      "\"What I will say is that you looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Coaching-wise Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively.",
      "\"I am really thankful to them all. There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age.\"",
      "He added: \"Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn't mess up. That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It's instilled in you.\"",
      "Despite his lengthy tenure at United, Lawrence's first-team outings were limited to a single senior match in May 2014 against Hull. At the time, Giggs was juggling roles as United's player-manager when Lawrence played most of the game.",
      "In a poignant moment, Giggs replaced Lawrence on the pitch with 20 minutes to go, marking his final appearance for United.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Lawrence said: \"He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I'll be forever grateful. Nothing will ever come close to that.",
      "\"I had been out on loan and got recalled. I played a game at Anfield for the under-21s and I played well. The first team played a few days later and I got a call to say I was in the squad.",
      "\"We went to the hotel and later that day he told me I was starting. I went back to my room and told my family and they all came up.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",

      "United have seen several bids, including a £60million offer, rejected but remain hopeful of getting their man, having already snared Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Brentford signed Mbeumo from French side Troyes in 2019, although their pursuit of the striker was far from straightforward. It was a big moment for Dykes, who had recently joined from EFL side Bury.",
      "“I felt big pressure because I walked into a function where I was trying to take forward some of the good work that had already been done,” he told the Bees’ website in December 2023.",
      "“Coming into Brentford, I’d never really spent a lot of money. I’d always worked at League One and League Two level.",
      "“The most I’d spent was £50,000 on a player, and then six weeks later we are paying €5million for Bryan Mbeumo. So obviously you start to think, ‘Wow, this is big money.’ But, at the end of the day, it’s just different money, same process.”",
      "Dykes, co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen and head coach Thomas Frank made a whistlestop trip to France in an effort to complete a deal Mbeumo, only for those initial talks to come to nothing.",
      "“We were figuring that there was a possibility to sign Bryan,” said Dykes. “We had cleverly sourced that information, having been told that he wouldn’t entertain the Championship.",
      "“It became quickly apparent that we had to get in and out of France in a day as Thomas (Frank) had his training commitments because it was near to the season starting.",
      "“Where the meeting was going to take place, there was no airport close enough we could find from London or a route to do in one day, so we didn’t know if we could make it work.",
      "“I remember Rasmus just calling me up saying, ‘I spoke to Matthew (Benham, club owner) and he said he’ll fire up a jet and we’ll get over there’ - at that point, I was just thinking, ‘Wow!’",
      "“But that’s when I started to feel the pressure. I’d lined it all up with Troyes, as well as the agents that were involved, so me, Thomas and Rasmus got on this jet.",
      "“We got there, it was one of the hottest days of the year, it had reached about 43°C when we landed. It was a 60-minute journey and the air conditioning wasn’t working in the taxi we got in!",
      "“We had the meeting, spoke with the player, the club and the agent, but the deal broke down. So, I had convinced everyone to fly over to France to get this deal done - I thought it was going to get done - but it had broken down.”",
      "A bad day then got even worse for Dykes before a deal for Mbeumo was eventually revived. He added: “On the way back, and I’m not a good flier in general, the pilot turned to us and said, ‘It’s chaotic weather in London, it’s snowing, there’s thunder, there’s lightning.’ I was thinking, ‘What? It was 43 degrees when we left France.’",
      "“And the journey back was horrendous - I could see the pilot avoiding the dark spots on the radar. I was bricking it!",
      "“But, fortunately, we landed safely and, more importantly, managed to turn around the deal a few days later and eventually sign him. So, Brentford fans must know that I risked my life to sign Bryan Mbeumo!”",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Manchester United have a little under two months left of the transfer window - and the Red Devils really need to get down to work. They have already sealed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "But the spending is unlikely to stop there. United are in dire need of a new forward to potentially solve their goalscoring issues and appear to have identified their man.",
      "A new midfielder, left-back and winger could all be set to arrive before the window closes on September 1. But before that, exits might have to be the first port of call as United attempt to gather funds after missing out on a spot in Europe for next season.",
      "And there are already a few candidates to leave Old Trafford, with some potentially worth millions. Where does the land lie right now though?",
      "It’s fair to say that the Brentford forward is right at the top of United’s shortlist of signings. They’ve already had two bids turned down for the Cameroonian and while it appears that the Bees are open to selling, they will only let him go for a price they deem suitable.",
      "As it stands, United chiefs remain confident of reaching an agreement before the end of the week. They might want to move a bit quicker to get everything rubber-stamped but all the signs are pointing to this one getting done.",
      "From Brentford to Aston Villa now, United are interested in adding an out-and-out striker to their squad. Having been linked with a host of options, it appears that Villa star Watkins is now the outstanding candidate.",
      "United reportedly held talks with Villa regarding a deal in January only for nothing to come of their initial discussions. But they are now making a concerted effort to sign the England man despite Villa’s £60m asking price.",
      "One reason that United have turned their attention to Watkins is the ongoing furore surrounding Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting Lisbon striker was thought to be at the top of United’s list, only for him to prioritise a move to Arsenal.",
      "Even then, a deal has proven to be difficult, with Gyokeres accusing Sporting of upping their demands, threatening strike action and even turning down clear-the-air talks. It’s all gotten a bit messy but it appears that the Gunners are inching closer to an agreement, putting United out of the race in the process.",
      "One deal that is a lot easier to do is a move for young defender Diego Leon. He is set to fly to the UK this week to undergo pre-season testing.",
      "Leon has already suggested that he is ready to fight for his place at Old Trafford. He said: \"I'm really happy, I think every player dreams of this. When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",
      "Over recent days, United’s interest in Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Fabian Ruiz emerged but a deal looks somewhat tricky to do. The Spaniard has two years left on his contract in the French capital, while manager Luis Enrique apparently wants to keep him around.",
      "Ruiz would be a quality addition to their midfield options but this one just appears to be speculation for now.",
      "While Enrique wants to keep hold of Ruiz, the same could certainly not be said of Ruben Amorim and Marcus Rashford. The forward was exiled to Aston Villa last term, the Midlands side recently confirming that they will not be activating their option to sign him.",
      "Rashford has already made his preference clear having ruled out a move to London, while he also does not want to reduce his £300k-per-week pay packet. He has also expressed interest in a move to Barcelona, who are interested in a move despite their imminent capture of Nico Williams. It looks like this one could rumble on for some time.",
      "With Rashford primed for an exit, he could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, who has also fallen out with Amorim. Serie A champions Napoli were reportedly interested but that has not progressed.",
      "A potential swap deal with Chelsea involving Christopher Nkunku was touted but that looks slightly unlikely right now. The Blues could still move for him but again, that might be another one that gets more clarification later in the window.",
      "Sticking with Chelsea, they have already dealt a considerable blow to United’s transfer window this summer. The Blues had a £25m obligation to buy former loanee Sancho but paid a £5m penalty clause to back out of that agreement.",
      "He is now set to return to Old Trafford. Juventus have recently emerged as potential suitors in a sensational swap deal, while Napoli and Fenerbahce have also been linked in the past. It’s clear that Sancho won’t be a United player next season, it just depends on where.",
      "Fellow forward Rasmus Hojlund could also depart over the coming months. The Danish forward endured a woeful second season at Old Trafford, with it being suggested that United were happy to cut their losses.",
      "Inter Milan looked to be the most likely to move for him but they have since cooled their interest in the former Atalanta man. It was reported that United would only move for Watkins should Hojlund leave so his future could potentially be key to how the rest of the window plays out at Old Trafford.",
      "Brazilian winger Antony has been a disastrous signing at Old Trafford and he looks sure to leave. All the suggestions are that Real Betis will make a renewed move for the former Ajax man following his successful loan move last season.",
      "But the Spanish side would struggle to match United’s current demands. Reports in Spain suggest that an agreement over a move is still some way off despite Antony making his desire to return to Seville abundantly clear.",
      "Amorim has a decision to make over United’s number one position. Andre Onana has struggled to convince during his time at Old Trafford and according to reports, United would be open to letting him leave on loan.",
      "Ligue 1 side Monaco emerged as suitors for his services but have since cooled their interest. The Red Devils have picked out a few potential replacements but Onana will need to leave before anything progresses.",

      "“He already thinks he’s a top player, already makes demands, acts without respect. It’s a shame, but there are other factors than just the player.

      "“It’s fine if you’re playing like Wayne Rooney. If you score 20 or 30 goals a season, do what you want, demand what you want. Garnacho has five goals and he’s carrying on like this. It’s crazy.”",

      "“We want players who want to play well, and there’s extra motivation in the year of a World Cup. I think Nkunku knows if he plays well, he can get back in the French squad for the summer. At the same time, he’s not the kind of player who disrupts the dressing room.",
      "“As for Garnacho, if he wants to go, get rid of him. I used to be a huge fan, but that’s over. Anyone like this, if they want to go, go. Even if you lose money, it doesn’t matter, because you can bring in a player who can behave as they should.”",

      "Romelu Lukaku has claimed that he never wanted a move to Manchester United but was swayed by his agent. The Belgian striker signed for the Red Devils in 2017 in a £75m deal.",
      "His switch came after a prolific spell with Everton having scored 87 goals in 166 appearances for the Toffees. And things started well for Lukaku at Old Trafford having scored 27 goals across his debut campaign.",
      "But things soon went awry having fallen out of favour during his second season, while he found the net just 15 times. Lukaku was eventually sold to Italian giants Inter Milan.",
      "The forward has now admitted that he was never clamouring for a move to United and instead wanted to return to former club Chelsea, only for then agent Mino Raiola and Jose Mourinho to convince him otherwise.",
      "Speaking to Koolcast Sport via Het Nieuwsblad, the now Napoli forward said: “I had already told everyone: I’m going to Chelsea. But suddenly Mourinho called me to say that Manchester United had made an offer.",
      "“I came back from vacation and suddenly there was an agreement with Everton. I said to Mino: ‘I don’t want this’, and then I decided now I’m doing everything myself.”",
      "After his exit from United, Lukaku managed to rediscover his goalscoring form, scoring 64 goals over two seasons before he eventually got his much-desired move to Chelsea. He was allowed to leave after just one season though, rejoining Inter on loan before a spell with Roma.",
      "Lukaku is now with another Italian side in the form of Napoli and helped the side to the Serie A title last term. Ironically, he could have ended up in Italy even earlier before he completed a permanent move to Everton, something that made him question his trust in agents.",
      "“It actually started in 2014. I signed with Everton at the time, but I could also go to Juventus, Wolfsburg and Atlético. That didn’t happen,” Lukaku added.",
      "“I ended up at Everton, no problem, but when I saw certain figures in my contract, I thought: something’s not right here. I started digging and then everything came out. A year later, De Bruyne moved to Manchester City and also started discovering everything. And then everything came out in the media.”",
      "Lukaku remains under contract with Napoli until 2027 and is set to be reunited with Kevin De Bruyne in Naples next season. Asked about the role he played, he said: “I spoke to him a few times and explained to him how things work at Napoli. I’m very happy that he’s joining us. Kevin is exactly what we need to take the next step. We don’t just want to defend the title – we want to improve.”",

      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are among those who have all returned from loan spells away. They were all on hefty wages and two of the three were signed for big money. It makes them hard to shift and the club may have to take major financial hits to get rid of them.",
      "No European football may prove to be a factor but it hasn't stopped the club spending in the market and Mbeumo's signing could see their spending exceed £100m. Here's the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils continue to negotiate with Brentford over the transfer of Mbeumo but are confident they can reach an agreement by the end of the week after seeing two bids rejected. They have made the Bees forward their top target at present as they eye their second summer arrival.",
      "The west Londoners have played hardball as they look to maximise their profit on Mbeumo, who has just enjoyed his best season yet, scoring 20 times, and Ruben Amorim believes he can perfectly suit the system he's trying to implement. United will go back in with a third bid after their latest in the region of £60m was rejected.",
      "The Daily Mail now reports that the Red Devils will table an offer of £65m which they believe will hit Brentford's valuation of the player and complete the deal. Those in the capital have already begun making plans for Mbeumo's departure.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been the subject of non-stop speculation this summer as the striker continues to be linked with a transfer to Manchester United or Arsenal. The forward has caught the eye since joining Sporting CP two summers ago, where he has developed into one of the most clinical No. 9s in the world.",
      "Gyokeres’ incredible tally includes 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting on his way to winning two Primeira Liga titles. United have developed an interest in the 27-year-old, partly because of their need for a goal-scorer and partly because Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim was the man who brought the best out of Gyokeres when he signed him from Coventry City.",
      "Yet, they face fierce competition from Arsenal, who are in search of their own striker after being left with no recognised centre-forwards for the second half of last season. The Gunners have been negotiating deals for both the Swede and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko in the hope they can complete the transfer that offers the best value.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe delivered the bombshell news on Tuesday that Arsenal were on the verge of reaching a verbal agreement with the striker over personal terms. It was reported that the agreement would be a five-year deal.",
      "After negotiating at length for the Slovenian’s move again this summer, the deal is now seemingly on the backburner. It is Gyokeres, rather than Sesko, who looks to be Emirates-bound, despite suggestions that Arteta and his staff preferred the latter due to his younger age and experience playing in a tougher league.",
      "Another key character in the ongoing circus surrounding Gyokeres this summer has been Frederico Varandas. The outspoken Sporting president first took issue with a claim made by Gyokeres’ agent, who said he had a gentleman’s agreement in place whereby the club had promised to let the forward leave for a fee of £59m - considerably less than his £85m release clause.",
      "But Varandas has now handed Arsenal and United a potential boost by admitting there is a \"strong likelihood\" Gyokeres will leave the club this summer - and for a possible discounted fee - saying: \"Sporting is calm regarding this matter. Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyokeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "“However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.\"",
      "Hinting at a potential new price tag, he added: “Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m (euros). He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "“In recent weeks, we have been paying attention. I saw a player, [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go [potentially to Arsenal] for £55m, and I saw Matheus Cunha move to Manchester United for around £62.5m.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26 years old. I believe Viktor could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world, which I don’t believe, as his agent is one of the best in the world.”",
      "In another boost to both Arsenal and United’s hopes that Gyokeres will leave Sporting, the Portuguese champions now appear to be looking to replace him. The Lisbon club have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic in the past week.",
      "As reported by Germanijak.HR, Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian club’s valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt, plus teams in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for his side last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goal-scoring record for less than £30m may also help Arsenal and United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who has been vocal in his frustrations towards the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag until now.",

Watkins, 29, was only a substitute for both of Villa's Champions League quarter-final clashes with Paris Saint-Germain last season.",
      "Now the England international could be team-mates with Rashford again. United are making a concerted effort to sign Watkins from Villa, who'd want around £60million.",
      "Unai Emery had taken a liking to Rashford after signing him on loan from United during the January transfer window and the Villa manager thought that he was better suited to starting against PSG. Villa ultimately went out, losing 5-4 on aggregate, and Rashford failed to score in either game.",
      "Watkins, meanwhile, was given just 25 minutes across the two legs, as he spent much of the contest on the bench. The striker couldn't hide his frustration in the days following Emery's decision and responded in the best way possible.",

      "It is understood United have held tentative talks with Villa about signing Watkins, who Amorim sees as the ideal player to lead his attack - given his proven goal scoring prowess. Villa would want around £60million for Watkins, who has three years left on his contract, but United are unwilling to pay that much, given his age and lack of resale value.",
      "United were willing to offer Rashford as part of a swap deal involving Watkins, but Villa decided against signing the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan deal was up. One obstacle to United's pursuit of Watkins is their inability to offer European football, following their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",

      "AC Milan and Inter Milan have confirmed they will redevelop the San Siro, which remains one of the most historic stadiums in the world and hosted the Champions League final as recently as 2016. The Milan stadium project is a long-running saga.",
      "Previous plans for a 60,000-capacity stadium inspired by the city’s Duomo called “Cathedral” in 2019 was abandoned after the clubs failed to get the backing of the local authority and they have now had to look elsewhere for the redesign. Milan and Inter had announced plans to pursue separate stadium builds before coming back together last year in a joint redevelopment project on the site of the San Siro.",

      "The Red Devils had a number of bids rejected for his services last year, while they also managed to agree personal terms with Branthwaite. That was despite United chiefs believing that funds would be low.",
      "Ratcliffe was willing to loosen the purse strings for Branthwaite but he will now not be moving any time soon having signed a new five-year deal with Everton. The 23-year-old is now tied down to his current side until 2030.",
      "Speaking about his new deal, Branthwaite said: “I’m over the moon. It's been something we've been talking about since the end of the season and to get it signed now is something I'm really excited about.",
      "“The trust the Club's put in me and how many games I've played over the past two seasons has made it quite an easy decision for me to stay and to keep progressing as a player.",
      "“I know the Club. I feel loved by the players – we’ve got a good group here – and the fans. Over the past few years, I’ve seen the impact the fans have on us as a team and how much it means to them. And, obviously, with the new stadium we’ve got here, the new ownership and the new manager, it's an exciting project and it's something I want to be part of.",

      "“The ambition was a huge thing. The way the manager wants us to go as a team and what he wants us to do for next season and where he wants us to challenge for has had a big impact on the decision. I think you saw towards the end of last season as a team what we can do.",
      "“The manager has been really good, not only for me but for the group. You saw the change in results, the change in mood since he came in. He drives the demands every day to be better.”",
      "United now have a decision to make over their defence. The Red Devils spent heavily last summer at centre-back with the signings of Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt. But they now have a potential vacancy with both Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof having left the side.",

      "A former Manchester United coach claimed the club made “one of the biggest mistakes in football” by selling midfielder Scott McTominay.",
      "United sold McTominay to Italian side Napoli last summer, where the Scotland international was an instant hit, leading them to the Serie A title in his debut season.",
      "McTominay was Napoli's stand-out player in their title-winning campaign, became a cult hero with the club's fans and was voted Serie A Player of the Season.",
      "United sold McTominay to help them comply with profit and sustainability regulations, with his £25.7million fee counting as pure profit on the balance sheet due to his status as an academy player.",
      "But former United coach Benni McCarthy, who worked with McTominay under former boss Erik ten Hag, said it was a major error to sell the 28-year-old, given the form he has shown for Napoli.",
      "“Of course, there are different reasons why you sell homegrown players sometimes,”said McCarthy. “When they go, the profit lets you sign more players.",
      "“Having said that, it was one of the biggest mistakes in football to let him leave. He was born to play for United. Maybe he wasn’t the most technical, but he had fight, and I think it’s what they will get back with Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Scotty was a player that you look for in a dressing room to get you where you want to be. To let him go for what was a small transfer fee was a big shame. I think everyone at the club regrets that decision.”",
      "McCarthy, who left United last summer, also revealed he pushed for United to sign Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo, only for the club's scouting department to veto the move.",
      "“Gakpo was the one that we wanted the most and missed out on,” said McCarthy. “I think he was the first player that we sat down and discussed, and decided that he was the player who would fit in perfectly.",
      "“We knew we could play him alongside Marcus Rashford, when Rashy was really on song in 2022. I think we were so close to getting him. At one stage, it was ours to lose. The agent knew Erik and there were really good talks.",
      "“The manager asked me to write up a profile for the player and to take it to the scouting department, so they knew my opinion. I watched the player, I made my case for why he would be ideal.",
      "“He could play on the left, he could work as a false nine. With him and Rashford we’d have been strong down the middle and on the left.",
      "“Then I was told the scouting department had watched him numerous times and they didn’t rate him. They said the stats weren’t right. For me, with my experience, I know what you need to deliver at a special club.",

However, he has carried his domestic form into the Champions League, finding the back of the net against Juventus, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Feyenoord last season.",
      "United have been linked with David over the last few years, but he was never close to moving to Manchester.",
      "Even though he was never a genuine target for United, his move to Juventus means a top-class striker has been taken off the market as United look to sign a prolific goalscorer.",
      "Victor Osimhen joined Galatasaray on loan for the 2024/25 season and signed a one-year contract extension with Napoli until June 2027 so that his value would be protected during his stint away.",
      "That means Napoli still have some negotiating power when it comes to selling Osimhen after the conclusion of his Galatasaray loan, but every club knows they want to sell him and that has to be a factor in any potential deal.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea last summer and he only turned 26 in December so should be coming into his prime. Yes, Osimhen is a big name and would demand large wages, which goes against Ineos' policy, but he is a prolific centre-forward.",
      "Osimhen scored 37 goals in 41 games for Galatasaray - an undeniably impressive record, even in a weaker division - and he would be the dream centre forward signing for many United fans.",
      "So why hasn't Osimhen found a new club yet? The answer is probably wage demands. They have appeared to be a stumbling block so far in this window in talks with other clubs and United will not break their wage structure.",
      "Having said that, United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Osimhen would be the perfect solution to Ruben Amorim's biggest problem, so perhaps a compromise could be found.",
      "The longer the transfer window goes on, the more United and Osimhen might need each other and a compromise could possibly be reached.",

Juventus are reported to be interested in the winger, and could opt to offer a trade for one of their top players.",
      "Serbian striker Dusan Vlahovic earned his move to Juventus after establishing himself as a top prospect at Serie A's Fiorentina, scoring 17 times in just 21 appearances in the league during his final year there. He's not hit those heights in black and white, but he remains a solid number nine.",
      "Young American Timothy Weah has also been named, but Ruben Amorim is not likely to need more wide players. Douglas Luiz was a big part of the Aston Villa squad that established themselves as Premier League regulars after promotion however, and could suit United as an all-action foil for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Some reckon that one of those Serie A regulars could do a job with Manchester United - with some caveats. Reader Verdad says: \"Douglas Luiz is a fantastic talent and would give United a real presence in the middle of the park as he does it all. That said, his career has been laden with muscular and hamstring injuries. In 2024-25 he missed 111 days and 20 matches. Wish him well and move on.\"",
      "Commenter Justifiably Sceptical writes: \"Douglas Luiz would be a decent option, but I'm not massively excited by it. Vlahovic is not an option at all. If you've read his comments, he's basically admitted that he's not athletic enough for the Prem and also lacks the work ethic.",
      "\"I'd rather bank whatever we can and put it towards an option that WE have chosen, rather than take players that another team want to get rid of.\"",
      "BestieTom writes: \"Vlahovic for Sancho, and try Hojlund in swap for Luiz. 2 out, and 2 in that we need. Vlahovic would be a good teacher for Obi, and Luiz, Ugarte, and Mainoo could compete for places alongside Fernandes. We could share all 4 for the 2 places in midfield and keep them fresh.\"",
      "Steady Irwin says: \"I wanted Vlahovic on loan in January to try and get us up the table and help us win some silverware. But long term, if you look at his wages, defensive output (yeah I know, striker, but you do occasionally need them to press/track back), holdup play, he is not really a long term option. Basically he would have gotten us goals in the short term but we need something better long term to get us playing better football.\"",
      "Weah has Frustratred's vote: \"Weah may not be a bad option though. He's played as a wingback a lot throughout his career and with Mazraoui now seen as more of a right sided CB and Dalot has not impressed going forward. Weah can be a decent rotational option for an attacking wing back and won't be on massive wages/injury prone like the other two.\"",
      "Pebbles7 says: \"I'd take both Luiz and Vlahovic. Offer Sancho as a straight swap for the two. If Juventus want a cash adjustment as well, consider it. If it makes sense, go for it. But for God's sake, don't spend the summer dithering before trying to get players in on 31st August.\"",

The club are working on a replacement, but there will be reasons why it takes a little longer than it may have otherwise done.",
      "It is a similar situation to the one that Chelsea found themselves in last season when it came to a front-of-shirt sponsor. The West London side had been wanting to achieve a figure in line with what some of their rivals had been able to bring in but a lack of competitive success and Champions League exposure meant that the value of the deals available weren’t as strong as hoped for.",

They want to ensure that they are not only holding the current value, but three years on from the initial Tezos deal, and taking into account inflation, they will want more than what was on offer to ensure that commercial revenues are growing and not diminishing.",
      "That is the challenge that is posed by a lack of Champions League football and the reputational damage that such a bad domestic campaign inflicted last season. United remains a globally recognised brand, but it isn’t associated with competitive success at the moment, nor does it look like that corner will be turned immediately, and getting major brands to part with significant sums of cash for training wear apparel exposure is a greater challenge than it previously has been.",
      "The club, without access to money from European football this coming season, needs to strike a good deal when it comes to renewing or bringing on board new commercial partners so as not to further impact what may be a challenging financial year during a period when they will be required to strengthen the squad in order to return themselves to Europe’s elite knockout club competition."

      "The Belgian striker switched from Everton to Old Trafford for a hefty £75million fee after an impressive stint at Everton, where he netted 87 goals in 166 games. Lukaku's first season at United started promisingly with 27 goals, but his form took a dip during the second season as he scored only 15 times and subsequently moved to Inter Milan.",
      "Lukaku candidly admitted his preference for the Blues over United, stating that despite informing everyone of his intention to move to Chelsea, Jose Mourinho's intervention and his then-agent Mino Raiola's influence swayed his decision.

      "\"I ended up at Everton, no problem, but when I saw certain figures in my contract, I thought: something's not right here. I started digging and then everything came out. A year later, De Bruyne moved to Manchester City and also started discovering everything. And then everything came out in the media.\"",

Kevin is exactly what we need to take the next step. We don't just want to defend the title – we want to improve.\""

      "Manchester United still have the bulk of their transfer business to conduct if they are going to hand Ruben Amorim his dream attack force, as was the intention heading into this summer.",
      "Last term, a 15th-placed Premier League finish was as sore as it gets for United, but shifting from one manager to the next involved a level of acceptance of teething problems. What was made obvious was deficiencies in attack, as only four other top-flight teams scored less than Amorim's men with 38 matches played.",
      "This is what prompted the swift payment of Matheus Cunha's £62.5m release clause from Wolves. The scorer of 17 goals in all 2024/25 competitions became the first signing of the summer.",
      "Next on the hit list is Bryan Mbeumo, with his desire to move to Old Trafford well documented as a deal is discussed with Brentford.",
      "And from there it is still a rather open book with two months of the summer left to play out. What is certain is that alongside other additions to Amorim's attack, outgoings will be a necessity.",
      "Mbeumo, naturally a right-sided attacker, would help Amad cover what is needed on that flank but also has shown ability at Brentford to play centrally as required.",
      "This can be partially offset by the permanent sale of Antony either now or later down the line, with the possibility of another loan an option as a last-ditch scenario.",
      "Cunha is a central-minded attacker, as is Ollie Watkins who is now being linked with the move to United in the wake of Viktor Gyokeres' saga. The club have reportedly accepted defeat in the race for Amorim's former striker at Sporting CP, so could instead turn to their rivals.",
      "Watkins' record speaks for itself - 87 goals and 42 assists in 223 Villa appearances - as one of England's current deadliest finishers. The only attribute against him is age as he is 29, but it is not as if United are in a position to be picky if they want to slowly but surely recover their place at the top of English football.",
      "The sale of striker Rasmus Hojlund will help free up funds and further space for the Watkins transfer, but that is not close to completion yet. Joshua Zirkzee could then be kept as cover, with 17-year-old Chido Obi also another who can be kept on the fringes of the senior squad and handed opportunities as appropriate.",
      "On the left flank it would seem an entire clear-out is in order.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho are all out of favour either in Amorim's eyes or from Erik ten Hag's previous regime so are all up for sale.",
      "The trio's departure would help bring in a significant portion of transfer funds to allow United to challenge some of their biggest rivals in a battle for a player now claimed to be worth £51m.",
      "The Independent say Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Fulham and Nottingham Forest have all been in contact with Lyon over the signing of Malick Fofana, a player who Old Trafford watched delight for the visitors from the bench in extra-time of last season's Europa League quarter-final second leg. His spritely play helped the French club take a 4-2 lead on the night, only for United to muster three goals out of nothing in the closing stages and advance.",
      "The 20-year-old is not close to making any move at this point in time, it is said, and as a long-term prospect not many talents in Europe have proven themselves as Fofana has done already in his young career. United could swoop in to complete their business.",
      "Amorim also has a collection of midfielders who are not shy to step further forward when it counts, namely Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount.",
      "Attacking midfielders: Bruno Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount",
      "Wingers: Amad, Malick Fofana, Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Strikers/centre forwards: Matheus Cunha, Chido Obi, Ollie Watkins, Joshua Zirkzee"

      "Brentford's sporting director, Phil Giles, has protected his club's best interests this week.",
      "\"There's significant interest in Bryan. I think it's been documented and publicised about, you know, his current preference,\" said Giles.",
      "\"From what I understand, if needs be, he's happy to stay at Brentford next year as well, so listen, let's see on that. I think our position is he had an unbelievable season last year and we expected interest in him. If that deal is right, then there's a deal to do, but if not, then he'll stay.\"",
      "Giles was asked about conversations regarding Mbeumo staying at Brentford and responded: \"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he is going to depart this summer.",
      "\"There is interest. He had a great season last season, so the interest is inevitable. If we get the right offer, there is potentially a deal to be done, but there's only so much we can say on that.\"",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, Giles discussed Mbeumo again and said: \"He has his ideas about where he wants to take his career. He is well within his rights to do that. It is not impossible he is still a Brentford player next season if we agree he is going to stay.\"",
      "Giles added Mbeumo would only be sold if it was \"the right deal\" for Brentford. \"Any club will tell you that,\" he said. \"If it's not right deal, why would we do it? He is certainly one of our best players, if not our best player, and we need our best players. There's no harm in keeping your best players.\"",
      "The interviews caused a stir on social media, but Giles was never going to publicly say there was no chance of Mbeumo staying at Brentford because that would damage their bargaining power.",
      "It would also not be true. There is a small chance that Mbeumo stays in London because anything can happen in the transfer market, although it's far likelier he leaves and gets his wish of a summer switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Giles was doing his job and protecting Brentford's negotiating power in the interviews earlier in the week and his comments won't worry United, who have tabled two bids for Mbeumo.",
      "United recently submitted an improved bid in excess of £60million for Mbeumo, but that fell short of Brentford's valuation and talks are continuing between the two clubs to find a compromise.",
      "Some supporters have suggested United should walk away from the deal, believing Brentford are trying to rinse the club dry. However, an agreement should be close at this stage of talks.",
      "United have overpaid for players in the past and are trying to improve their reputation in the market, but Mbeumo is a Premier League-proven player and should be worth haggling for."

      "Manchester United trio Casemiro, Andre Onana, and Kobbie Mainoo have all sparked speculation about their futures after dropping transfer hints on social media.",
      "Casemiro has also been linked with a summer move away from Old Trafford, with Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr reportedly interested in reuniting him wit Cristiano Ronaldo. The former Real Madrid midfielder has one year left on his contract, with the Reds holding an option to extend it by a further year, as he enters the latter stages of his career.",
      "At 33, this summer was perhaps seen as the last chance for the Reds to recoup a decent fee for him. Casemiro was signed from Real for £70million three years ago and is among United’s top earners, reportedly earning £350,000 per week.",
      "As for Mainoo, The Guardian reported in March that the 20-year-old was inclined to turn down a new contract at Old Trafford and pursue a move abroad. The youngster signed a new long-term deal in February 2023, running until 2027 with an option for a further year.",
      "Amid ongoing uncertainty about the trio’s futures, a recent club post on social media may have given a significant hint. On Tuesday, United took to Instagram to share the players' new profile pictures, featuring Casemiro, Mainoo and Onana all wearing the club's new kit for the forthcoming season.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly intensifying their pursuit of Aston Villa and England forward Ollie Watkins. The Reds had initially set their sights on Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, who previously played under Old Trafford manager Ruben Amorim in Portugal.",
      "However, United are said to believe that Gyokeres has chosen to sign with Arsenal instead, prompting them to shift their focus to 29-year-old Watkins. Despite ongoing difficulties in negotiating a deal with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, United are reportedly determined to secure Watkins' services.",
      "Watkins reportedly grew unhappy last season after falling behind loanee United striker Marcus Rashford during the latter half of the campaign. After Villa narrowly missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of last season, losing 2-0 to United, Watkins is reportedly open to exploring new opportunities elsewhere.",
      "It is claimed that United have initiated preliminary discussions with Villa about signing Watkins, whom Amorim views as the perfect candidate to spearhead his attack, given his proven goal-scoring ability. Villa would demand around £60million for Watkins, who has three years remaining on his contract, but United are reluctant to meet this valuation due to his age and limited resale value.",
      "United had reportedly proposed including Rashford in a swap deal for Watkins, but Villa declined the opportunity to sign the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan period ended. A potential stumbling block in United's pursuit of Watkins is their inability to offer European football, following their 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May, reports the Mirror.",
      "United are looking to offload Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, and Antony in an effort to raise funds for new signings. Watkins, who penned a new long-term deal with Villa in October 2023 extending his stay until 2028, faced competition last season from the likes of Jhon Duran and later Rashford, but wasn't always a first-choice starter.",
      "\"But even when he's not doing both, he's working for the team. Defensively, the commitment was always high.",

      "Manchester United are confident they are getting closer to Bryan Mbeumo, allowing them to prepare their move for Ollie Watkins…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nBack in the power ranking after The Athletic reported that Madrid are ‘open to selling’ the Brazilian winger, who is apparently the Gunners’ ‘dream target’ this summer. David Ornstein says Arsenal are keen, but that a transfer is unlikely if Gabriel Martinelli isn’t sold. Welp.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "",
      "18) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "15) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Bayern Munich\nWhen you scratch the surface of the reports of Bayern’s interest, it seems Rashford makes only their ‘longlist’ of targets. And it seems a similar story at Barcelona. So if Rashford is to get his big move to a European club in contention for titles, it almost certainly won’t be until late in the window by which time United will have been backed into a corner.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "13) Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo, but Madueke has already been the subject of a bid, apparently.",
      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",
      "",
      "11) 🆕 Thierno Barry – Villarreal to Everton\nThe France Under-21 striker has a £34million release clause but the Guardian reckons Everton are close to securing a hefty discount to sign a replacement for Dominic Calvert-Lewin for £27million. Barry bagged 11 goals last season.",
      "",
      "10) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "9) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "7) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nAfter having a £45m bid rejected by Forest, the Magpies have come back with a £55m bid, which will be very hard to refuse. It looks like Newcastle will get their man.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment back in May but still we’re waiting for confirmation. Apparently, Zubimendi was due in London a week ago to complete his move, but Arsenal won’t be rushed this summer. This week, surely…"

      "Man Utd are closing in on a crucial moment in their pursuit of Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, according to a report, which outlines their next steps if a third bid is to be rejected.",
      "After a turbulent 2024/25 campaign, Man Utd are eager to strengthen their attacking options ahead of the new season under manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Mbeumo, the Cameroon international, has made it clear he wants to join Utd, but talks between the clubs have been slow and complex.",
      "Utd’s initial offer of £45 million plus £10 million in add-ons was rejected, and a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in add-ons also failed to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "The west London club believe Mbeumo’s worth exceeds the amount the Red Devils recently paid for Matheus Cunha, intensifying the standoff. Cunha’s £62.5 million transfer clause was triggered in June, and the fee will be paid to Wolves over two years.",
      "Fabrizio Romano revealed that talks restarted recently, with Utd carefully reviewing how far they can push their offer. He said:",
      "“So constant contacts between the two clubs to reach an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo. There is still no here we go, but may United keep working on that, United keep advancing, United keep their confidence and their optimism to make the deal happen.”",
      "The club are thought to be aware that an overpayment could set a dangerous precedent in the transfer market, especially given criticism from owners INEOS and internal calls for more disciplined spending.",
      "For that reason, according to GiveMeSport, club officials are prepared to walk away from the deal entirely should their third bid fail to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "An internal deadline reportedly looms, aiming to have the deal concluded before the start of pre-season training. However, with no agreement yet in place, that timeline appears increasingly optimistic.",
      "Mbeumo’s Premier League statistics underline why United are so keen to sign him. The 25-year-old finished last season as Brentford’s top scorer with 20 goals in 38 appearances, leading the squad in key passes per game and match ratings.",
      "His ability to unlock defences with pace and precision has made him one of the league’s most dangerous forwards.",
      "Although there’s growing hope he could line up in a Brentford shirt next season, the club is preparing for the possibility that their star player will leave this summer. The financial realities facing the Bees, combined with Mbeumo’s desire to play on a bigger stage, suggest the transfer could be imminent.",
      "Man Utd are closing in on the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford with the deal set to “speed up soon”, according to an insider.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is “happy to stay to stay at Brentford” according to the Bees’ director of football as Man Utd ‘make contact’ with Aston Villa over their £60m forward.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘much closer’ to landing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they have set a deadline to ‘wrap up a deal’.",
      "Manchester United have a rare chance to end a ‘vicious cycle’ with their transfers, while there is praise for Sir Lee Carsley and his ‘mustard’ England U21s.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer."

      "Benni McCarthy, former Man Utd coach and ex-professional, has opened up on Jadon Sancho’s challenging spell under Erik ten Hag, offering rare insight into when the winger’s struggles began to show.",
      "“I couldn’t fault Jadon in training. He brings unbelievable quality, ability and skills,” McCarthy told BetOnline. “He can make you stop in awe and ask yourself just how he can do things. He brought unmatched quality.”",
      "But the former forward also pinpointed a key issue: Sancho’s reserved nature off the pitch, which may have given Erik ten Hag and his Utd team-mates the wrong impression.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates.",
      "He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.”",
      "McCarthy emphasized that the winger’s quiet personality shouldn’t overshadow his talent or work ethic.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.”",
      "But when it came to consistency, McCarthy explained where the cracks began to appear.",
      "“I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best every day. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.”",
      "Despite the difficulties, McCarthy reserved praise for Sancho’s moments of brilliance.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him; he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho’s time at Man Utd has been a rollercoaster. After a mixed loan spell at Chelsea, who reportedly paid to opt out of signing him permanently, he’s nailed on to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Reports now suggest Juventus have offered three players to Utd in a swap deal as they eye Sancho’s signature.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘offered’ at least two Juventus players ‘in exchange’ for Jadon Sancho.",

      "There’s not so much talk over moves for wing-backs, which feels odd given Amorim’s reliance on them in his 3-4-3 system, though the news that Dumfries is available for just €25m [£21m] should light a fire under United’s recruitment team.",

      "In a week in which Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton as Manchester United decide whether to overpay for Bryan Mbeumo while Tottenham and Arsenal make plays for Mohammed Kudus and Eberechi Eze, we’re faced with two troubling realities: one old, one new.",
      "Big Six clubs poaching the best of the rest has been commonplace for at least the last two decades. But this summer does feel particularly poignant in what has been a 21st century Premier League d*ck-measuring contest given the sheer number of these pillagings and because two of the raiders were worse last season than the teams they’re looting: United finished 14 points behind Brentford; Tottenham finished five points behind West Ham.",
      "It doesn’t seem fair, but then neither does the Small 14 being able to plunder potential future Big Six stars from every other club in Europe outside your Real Madrids, Barcelonas and Bayern Munichs.",
      "All of these players being targeted by the top (or formerly top) Premier League clubs are of a type. Managers, sporting directors, whoever’s making key decisions at football clubs these days, want forwards whose first thought is to dribble rather than pass. Matheus Cunha is another example and we suspect interest in Anthony Gordon and Morgan Rogers isn’t about to go away any time soon for the very same reason.",
      "The desire to have these sorts of footballers in top teams isn’t what’s troubling – the opposite if anything. Who doesn’t want to see Eze or Kudus diddling defenders with the ball at their feet before letting fly from 25 yards? Yes please. It’s the impact of what’s clearly becoming a bit of an obsession on your classic playmaker that’s disturbing.",
      "It’s the guys who have a picture in their head before the ball comes to them in a tight space and manoeuvre away from a defender before delivering a killer through ball, rather than drifting past or barrelling through them, that we’re concerned for. We’re looking at you, Martin Odegaard. And you, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "We’re of course looking forward to the irony of Manchester United turning down £100m from the Saudi Pro League for their 30-year-old captain in the summer when by Christmas, after a year of Ruben Amorim trying to fit Fernandes into his entirely unsuited system, he’s sitting on the bench watching Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro in the pivot with Mbeumo and Cunha ahead of them as his value plummets, but we would much rather be watching a United team with Fernandes in it.",
      "We got a taste of what Arsenal would be like without Odegaard last season – both when he was and wasn’t injured, as he wasn’t the same Odegaard we enjoyed the season before – and it wasn’t pretty. It was robotic. We knew what each and every player was going to do on that pitch before they did it.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Arsenal now ‘well advanced’ on £68m fifth signing from PL club as next three targets are named\n👉 Arsenal get huge boost over ‘dream target’ as £75m transfer takes shape after exit update\n👉 Advantage Spurs in north London with one Arsenal star ‘jealous’ amid new Gyokeres ‘blow’",
      "We like a bit of that. We like that full-backs essentially know Bukayo Saka is going to run at them, jink inside and get a shot away because them being powerless to stop him is a thoroughly enjoyable display of his brilliance. But we would also like some mystery, some guile, some head-on-a-swivel-how-the-f***-did-he-see-and-play-that-pass stuff.",
      "Odegaard must be concerned by Arsenal’s push for Eze; aware of the turning tide away from players like him as we are. It would have been unthinkable a year ago to imagine an Arsenal side without Odegaard, but amid this increasing desire for players who dribble past opponents to create overloads after a very poor season by his standards, there won’t be too many surprised to see a midfield three of Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Eberechi Eze next term.",
      "Hope for the future is retained in the hybrids – your Cole Palmers, Morgan Gibbs-Whites and Florian Wirtzs – who can dribble with the best of them but whose eye for a pass sets them apart.",
      "But in a season in which Odegaard and Fernandes could lose their formerly nailed-on places we may be left thinking wistfully of Cesc Fabregas and David Silva, and wondering whether their regens will ever again be given the opportunity in a Premier League now valuing forward mobility over subtle craft.",
      "Teddy Sheringham has praised Bruno Fernandes for staying at “big club” Manchester United while they “aren’t at the top of their game.”",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been eviscerated in the Mailbox but there is plenty of time and space to thank Ange Postecoglou for making Spurs interesting again.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is a ‘whiny baby’ who ‘was never world class’ and has screwed Manchester United players over with a decision based entirely on his ‘ego’."

      "Who’s the dream signing for every Premier League club? We’re all over it.",
      "From Rodrygo heading to Arsenal to Alexander Isak eyeing Liverpool, these potential transfers might sound ambitious — but they’re far from impossible.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Rodrygo\n‘Dream’ signings should really involve players not already trying to force through a move, which rules out Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal, for example. That makes the signing of an elite left-winger the dreamiest of scenarios, and Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo is our pick over Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams.",
      "Rodrygo was an unused substitute in Madrid’s Club World Cup last-16 win over Juventus, making it one start out of a possible four and just 88 minutes played in the United States. This saga should rumble on into the closing weeks of the transfer window, but Arsenal are there and ready to pounce for a genuinely outstanding forward. Rodrygo can take this lot to the next level.",
      "READ: FAO Arsenal and Liverpool: the biggest signings take longer because of secret clauses and Zaha",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Rafael Leao\nA slight downgrade on Rodrygo – but still a fantastic and dangerous winger – Leao looks increasingly likely to leave AC Milan this summer. With Chelsea signing Jamie Gittens, and Arsenal and Liverpool targeting other options, the Portuguese international might just settle on a slightly less ambitious move to Aston Villa.",
      "The Villans are hardly lacking ambition themselves and could feasibly qualify for the Champions League in 2025/26 after narrowly missing out last season. That, combined with the lure of the Premier League, could tempt Leao into making the surprise switch to Villa Park.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Jorrel Hato\nWe wanted to somehow include Ajax wonderkid Hato joining a non-Big Six club. He’s wanted by Europe’s elite, with Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal in the picture.",
      "Bournemouth are absolutely not in the picture, but that’s not to say it’s a completely unrealistic transfer. Hato could view the Cherries as a perfect stepping stone to the really big time. Dean Huijsen says hello. Milos Kerkez says hey. Illia Zabarnyi also says hi, amidst interest from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Andoni Iraola is a superb manager for any young, ambitious player and is desperate for a new centre-back after selling Huijsen to Real Madrid. Furthermore, Hato can play right or left-back, and Iraola has just lost Milos Kerkez – albeit he has signed a replacement in Adrien Truffert – while an ancient Adam Smith remains his first-choice right-back.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Bryan Mbeumo\nHe’s better than anyone they could get, and that’s the bottom line. Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season; only Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak scored more.",
      "Mbeumo is wanted by Manchester United, but there’s no agreement between the two clubs. The Cameroonian winger isn’t causing a fuss and is open to staying at Brentford if a deal can’t be struck, with the Red Devils already failing with two bids. He’s probably playing the long game, knowing he can leave for less next summer or for nothing in 2027, with a tasty signing-on bonus and salary.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Harvey Elliott\nElliott to Brighton felt pretty realistic but all of a sudden, it would be a major coup for Fabian Hurzeler’s side. There are Champions League clubs in the mix after an immense Under-21 European Championship-winning campaign with England.",
      "He just feels very Brighton, doesn’t he? And £40m would be a very good deal for everyone involved. With a buy-back clause, obviously.",
      "",
      "Burnley: Bilal El Khannouss\nBurnley will forever be the most awkward team in our ‘one per club’ features. That’s painfully obvious once again, with El Khannouss deemed the best and most ambitious signing they could realistically make this summer.",
      "Would signing El Khannouss from Leicester be a dream come true for Burnley? Well…no. But what would feasibly be a ‘dream signing’ for the Clarets that could actually happen? We’re hardly going to say Lionel Messi or Neymar. Their fans would probably be beside themselves with the signing of Lewis Cook, to be honest.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Marc Guehi\nThe Blues have finally strengthened up front, signing Liam Delap for £30million and agreeing a deal for Brighton’s Joao Pedro. So, looking at their strongest XI, a central defender is clearly the next priority.",
      "Enter Guehi. We initially focused on a left-footed centre-back, overlooking the fact that Levi Colwill exists, and went with Inter’s Alessandro Bastoni. But Guehi and Colwill would make a more natural defensive partnership.",
      "Chelsea sold Guehi to Crystal Palace for £18m in July 2021 and have been linked with him quite a bit since then, the fools that they are. This would be a hilariously typical Blues signing but a fantastic one that would massively benefit them and England.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Ousmane Diomande\nThis one is actually on. On like Donkey Kong.",
      "Oliver Glasner wants a new centre-back with Marc Guehi attracting serious interest, and Sporting’s Diomande is right at the top of his wish-list. We like it. We like it a lot.",
      "A dominant presence with pace, power and a ridiculous ceiling, Diomande would be a statement signing.",
      "",
      "Everton: Mohammed Kudus\nExtending Jarrad Branthwaite’s contract is huge for Everton, who have a pretty settled centre-back partnership in the 23-year-old and James Tarkowski. A couple of full-backs wouldn’t go amiss, but hardly ‘dreamy’. David Moyes could also do with a new defensive midfielder, but we reckon an X-factor on the right wing would make the biggest difference, especially with Villarreal striker Thierno Barry set to join and Iliman Ndiaye leading the Toffees’ attack in 2024/25.",
      "Picking between Mohammed Kudus, Johan Bakayoko and Antonio Nusa was tough. Ultimately, we went for Kudus, who might have to swallow his pride to agree a move from West Ham to Everton.",
      "He’s been linked with Tottenham, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, but it’s unclear how keen those big boys really are after a season with just five goals and three assists in the Premier League. For the Toffees, though, playing under his former manager Moyes, Kudus could thrive and help the club kick off their new era at the Hill Dickinson Stadium in style.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Ivan Toney\nWillian was tempting, you know, for s**ts and giggles, but Toney to Fulham feels just realistic and ambitious enough to qualify as a ‘dream signing’.",
      "Toney might have been disappointed to end up at Saudi club Al Ahly last summer, but his bank account certainly wasn’t. That said, he could easily follow the growing trend of players ditching the Saudi Pro League after a year – or six months in Jhon Duran’s case.",
      "The obvious stumbling block is his current salary, which no Premier League club will match. But if Toney’s willing to take a modest pay cut, he could do a lot worse than Fulham…and Fulham would struggle to do much better than Toney.",
      "",
      "Leeds United: Christian Pulisic\nSigning Christian Pulisic would be a real statement from Leeds’ new American owners.",
      "The Whites need a Raphinha-style forward to help them survive in the Premier League and avoid the fate of the last six promoted clubs. They’re well equipped to stay up, but only if their summer recruitment hits the mark.",
      "A Raphinha return would be ridiculous to suggest, but splashing the cash to bring Pulisic back to England after an inconsistent Chelsea spell would be a transfer masterstroke. Crucially, it’s not completely out of the question.",
      "‘The LeBron James of Soccer’ has 55 goal involvements in two seasons for AC Milan and boasts an impressive international record with 33 goals in 78 caps.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Alexander Isak\nThis transfer is unrealistic, mainly because of Newcastle United’s eye-watering asking price. But there is an asking price. If Liverpool decide Isak is worth £130m, they’ll get him. Simple as that.",
      "The Reds have already smashed their record transfer fee this summer with Florian Wirtz, and after being stingy in recent windows, they’re clearly ready to spend big now, especially after realising they’ve replaced Jurgen Klopp with an elite, title-winning head coach.",
      "Having already signed an attacking midfielder, right-back, and left-back, Liverpool’s priority is now moving on Darwin Nunez and bringing in a ready-made replacement. Interest in Isak is genuine (and terrifying) for Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, and most of all Newcastle, who are understandably reluctant to lose a player who’s scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances.",
      "But when money talks, £130m+ will be impossible to turn down.",
      "MORE: Isak, Newcastle know what happens when clubs ‘break’, ‘bend’, ‘smash’, ‘dismantle’ or ‘rip up’ wage structure",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Gianluigi Donnarumma\nA new goalkeeper feels like the next natural upgrade for City. Ederson’s reliability has dipped, and while Donnarumma isn’t quite as comfortable with the ball at his feet, he’d be a fantastic replacement.",
      "The Italian is expected to extend his PSG contract, but as it stands, his deal runs out in 2026, and Pep Guardiola is keeping an eye on things.",
      "Ederson continues to attract interest from Saudi Arabia and fittingly made a howler in a Club World Cup win over Juventus just hours after insisting he wanted to stay. It might not be your call, fella.",
      "Donnarumma is the best possible replacement. He’s only 26, a Champions League-winning goalkeeper, and already a veteran. Every other Premier League club will be hoping City don’t pull this off.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Viktor Gyokeres\nThis one hinges on an extremely ambitious (or unrealistic) hijack of Arsenal’s pursuit of Gyokeres or the Gunners deciding to move on and go full Sesko instead.",
      "After scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season, Gyokeres is a wanted man. United’s interest seems doomed to failure as the striker waits for Arsenal to pull the trigger, but with his old boss Ruben Amorim now at Old Trafford, there’s just enough hope to keep the delusion alive.",
      "United are desperate for an actual goalscorer. Rasmus Hojlund clearly isn’t that. And nobody knows what Joshua Zirkzee even is.",
      "United would undoubtedly find a way to United all over Gyokeres’ output, but even if he bags half of last season’s total, he’d still be a colossal upgrade on what Amorim currently has to work with.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Raphinha\nSince leaving Leeds United in 2022, Raphinha has been furiously linked with a move away from Barcelona. Arsenal and Chelsea have been mentioned plenty, but Newcastle are very much in the picture. As are Manchester United; but only for clicks.",
      "Raphinha has been in Ballon d’Or form for Barca but won’t be thrilled watching his bosses chase Nico Williams and Liverpool’s Luis Diaz. Competition’s healthy, sure, but the 28-year-old will be wondering why they’re bothering after him and Lamine Yamal combined for 102 goal involvements in 2024/25.",
      "With Barca targeting a left-winger, Raphinha could be on the move. Newcastle desperately need a right-winger, and the Brazilian would be a genuinely sensational signing, even if he turns 29 this December and would cost a fortune.",
      "It’s about time these rich f**kers went out and signed a world-class, world-renowned superstar. We’ve been waiting since the day they were bought by PIF.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Dusan Vlahovic\nNuno Espirito Santo’s side are the surprise frontrunners for Vlahovic’s signature, with Juventus reportedly open to selling him for around £40m.",
      "That would have been incomprehensible this time last year – but with Forest heading for Europe and Vlahovic struggling in Italy, it suddenly feels very realistic. The Serbian has been offered to Manchester United and former suitors Arsenal, but neither have batted an eyelid. That says plenty, especially about the former.",
      "Chris Wood has been a fantastic player for Forest, but he turns 34 in December and scored just twice in his last 11 Premier League appearances in 2024/25 as his side bottled Champions League football. Vlahovic has similar physical attributes, is eight years younger, and still has the potential to become one of Europe’s best strikers.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Gustavo Hamer\nWe’re back in familiar territory: the Burnley conundrum. Sunderland have already made two excellent, and expensive, signings in Habib Diarra and Enzo Le Fee, so splashing out again might seem excessive. But improving their attack should still be the priority.",
      "Promoted clubs need a forward capable of winning games on their own – but short of that, they could do a lot worse than Hamer. He went down with Sheffield United last year, but this would be a top-class addition.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Xavi Simons\nA game-changing forward is exactly what Spurs need, with Harry Kane long gone and Heung-min Son’s world-class ability also nowhere to be seen.",
      "Kudus has been strongly linked, and new Spurs boss Thomas Frank reportedly wants to reunite with Mbeumo, but the prospect of a world-class talent arriving from abroad is too good to ignore. A Rodrygo hijack would be sexy, but RB Leipzig attacker Simons is our man for Spurs.",
      "He’s one of the best available players around and can operate as an attacking midfielder or on either wing. We’d love to see him in the Premier League, and Spurs would benefit massively from making it happen.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Piero Hincapie\nGraham Potter wants to rebuild this West Ham squad using the Kudus funds, a year after Julen Lopetegui did the same with signings that felt ambitious at the time but quickly became questionable at best.",
      "An elite centre-back accustomed to playing in a back three would be absolutely perfect, though the Hammers also need reinforcements up front and in central midfield.",
      "Hincapie is an outstanding talent, and Bayer Leverkusen will want a huge fee. The 23-year-old Ecuadorian has been linked with plenty of big clubs, but the clout mid-table Premier League sides now carry has never been stronger. This would potentially go down as the signing of the summer.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Ademola Lookman\nLookman seems destined for a Premier League return after a previously miserable time representing Everton, Fulham and Leicester City. He is the personification of ‘unfinished business’.",
      "With Matheus Cunha gone, Wolves need a versatile, take-the-game-by-the-scruff-of-the-neck forward. Lookman could be that guy – but he won’t come cheap from Atalanta.",
      "Transfermarkt value the 27-year-old at €60m (£51.5m), which is slightly less than Cunha fetched from Manchester United. Wolves have been pretty reluctant to spend big in recent years due to the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, but could find themselves in relegation bother if their former talisman isn’t properly replaced.",
      "The prospect of finally shining in Our League could tempt Lookman to push for the move, which could play into Wolves’ hands.",

      "United and their fans spent literally my entire lifespan as a football fan (89 in case you were curious) bleating about how rich they were. Then complain about how everyone rips you off.",
      "Firstly any team that succeeds gets inflation because the selling team knows that you see value in their player and you have money in your pocket from your success. It literally happens to everyone. Not just United. Liverpool with Allison and VVD who were obvious bargains now but at the time everyone thought we’d over paid. City with Robinho, Mangala, Grealish. Chelsea have about 600 of them. Arsenal with Pepe and a few others.",
      "This idea poor little underdog united get picked on is nonsense. You don’t have to agree to buy those players. And most of the time these signings and decisions are ones which the majority of the fanbase are clamouring for. Maguire? Lukaku? Jose as manager? Ole? No fan base gets what they ask for more than United fans. If anything execs at United need to start ignoring what the fans ask for because they repeatedly ask for things which don’t work out.\nLee",

      "Man Utd still have an advantage, even with their ‘tax’\nI’m surprised that more comparisons haven’t been made between the Everton of 5 years ago and the current Man Utd situation. The Everton story is well known – whilst trying to break into the top 4 we ended up overpaying for players and giving them long contracts on high wages. Then one of our most effective players got suspended over sexual allegations, results on the pitch didn’t go our way, and we ended up getting through managers quite quickly.",
      "Years of financial problems then followed because we had a load of deadwood in the squad that we couldn’t offload because of their high wages…….so quite a similar story to the Man United of recent years.",
      "But things are not equal. The lure of playing for Manchester United is still greater than playing for the other 14. Thanks to their loyal support base Man U’s revenue is so great that they can afford to pay the Man U tax and even make duff transfers.",
      "Fortunately, Everton managed to stay in the top flight and we’ve ended up with a fantastic new stadium, a manager that knows how to succeed in the Premier League, and a squad with a realistic wage structure. Everton have sorted out their problems and the future is looking bright – in my view this puts them years ahead of Man Utd. But players will still choose to play for Man United if given the choice. That is the reality right now and it will continue to be so unless Man United continue to make mistakes in the transfer market and when selecting first team coaches.\nThe Logical Dictator (a temporarily optimistic Everton fan)",

You quite rightly declined to publish it, because I started to regret it before it was even clear you’d binned it, as my confidence began to unravel.",
      "Mbeumo was clearly a transfer that had to be accomplished fast. If we wanted to sign him — and his fbRef page shows why he could be incredible for us — we should have offered Brentford their asking price on day one of the window and figured out a way of working him into the wage structure.",
      "Lowballing them made it a public spectacle and got Manchester United and Spurs involved, costing us what my nephew (the most informed supporter I personally know in the US) called “the perfect player for us, for Howe.” But at least we didn’t over-pay.",
      "And is James Trafford being treated as our highest priority? He’s a welcome addition who will nonetheless require either Dubravka or Pope to exit, probably without any significant profit. But I’ve never heard anybody say they’d be excited to welcome him. He’s a long-term solution to a problem we don’t have yet. We should find long-term solutions to the problems we do have at RW, CB, and ST.",
      "Thus, the desultory bid for Elanga had me pulling my hair in frustration. Forest know they won’t keep him, but they have no reason to accept the first offer that comes along. It’s asinine of us.",
      "I have never understood that Eddie Howe had anything other than targeting and veto powers when it comes to transfers, in which case, I would blame the Mitchell/Ashworth/Eales disasters for the vision vacuum. James, however, suggests that Eddie and his son are in charge and emphatically the problem, and if he’s right in his facts, he’s right in his opinion. The board would be/are mad to put him in charge of such decisions and the strategies that they require.",
      "But Howe may hold more cards than I thought. Besides the Cup and two UCL spots, the only other person between the Board and the squad is General Manager Jamie Reuben, hardly a man used to swimming these waters. Howe’s probably swinging more weight right now than he ever will, unless he manages England.",
      "The Board is evidently difficult to work with, having driven off Ghodoussi and Stavely (still revered by many NUFC supporters), then Ashworth and Mitchell. Mitchell may have had beef with Howe, but it was the Board’s responsibility to manage that. Darren Eales reportedly stepped down as CEO — he’s still technically in office until a replacement is named — after a leukemia diagnosis, which can hardly be blamed on the Board. But his effective absence is fast becoming a disaster. If Eddie and his boy are the only people left standing, we may be effed for this summer.",
      "We need an excellent Sporting Director/Manager of Football type, stat. More, even, than we need players. Whatever issues the Board is facing, it’s clear they need to be resolved.

Now a few of those add ons have probably been activated (but I see no signs of an imminent ballon D’or for young Darwin). Yet whenever I see him discussed now there seems to be a shift with the £84m being used as his cost to Liverpool.",
      "This just has me wondering if this is a deliberate action that is being propagated by Liverpool in some way to subtly influence potential suitors when it comes to negotiating on price I.e. he seems more of a bargain?",
      "Now the Harvey Elliott news from yesterday, I think realistically he’s worth £40m max, obvs high ceiling but pretty unproven and with bad injury record. I also suspect this is what Liverpool think, but I also think Liverpool don’t massively want to sell him and are desperate for a buy back as they really believe he will kick on over the next few years. I just wonder if this £50m without a buyback is again a bit of a narrative spin to make the £40ish million with a buy back more achievable.",

      "If we take Quansah as an example, he made 34 appearances last season, and performed brilliantly in almost all of them. Liverpool are going to have to spend money buying a replacement for Quansah. Let’s say Liverpool buy Guehi (who many would debate is not as good as Quansah) as a replacement for 60 million pounds, and give him a five year contract worth 150k a week.",
      "If Guehi doesn’t work out, and Liverpool find themselves having to re-sign Quansah next season, it would actually turn out to be an incredibly expensive mistake. Liverpool will have spent 60m on Quansah’s replacement, and then lose 25 million (the buy back fee minus the original transfer fee received by Liverpool) bringing him back. That’s already 85 million pounds wasted, before you take into account the 150k a week salary they are lumbered with for the next five years.",
      "In total, replacing Quansah with Guehi and the then buying Quansah back would cost Liverpool up to 121 million pounds. Not to mention Liverpool would have lost out on his services while he was out in Germany performing brilliantly for Leverkusen. Is that incredibly smart business? I’m really not sure it is.",
      "Lets explore the alternative, which is keeping the academy product who performed so well in 34 games last season at the club, and allowing him to flourish and grow in a squad full of world class talent. Do you know how much that would have cost Liverpool? Nothing.",

He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",
      "",
      "17 – Jude Bellingham (£25m, Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund in July 2020)\nA total of 44 first-team appearances for Championship side Birmingham was enough to tempt Bundesliga giants and professional stepping stone Borussia Dortmund into signing Bellingham; none of the parties involved will have any regrets.",
      "",
      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",
      "",
      "19 – Kylian Mbappe (£166m, Monaco to PSG in June 2018)\nThe most expensive teenager in the world and it is not particularly close; Joao Felix joined Atletico Madrid at the same age for £113m, while Bellingham’s move to Real Madrid could cost a couple million more than that with add-ons. The ridiculous Mbappe became PSG’s record scorer before leaving.",
      "",

      "21 – Moises Caicedo (£100m, Brighton to Chelsea in August 2023)\nBrighton did what Brighton do and held out long enough for Liverpool and Chelsea to walk into a blindfolded blinking contest, with Caicedo ultimately making the decision by turning down a British record £111m move to the former in favour of a potential £115m switch to the latter.",

      "24 – Declan Rice (£100m, West Ham to Arsenal in July 2023)\nArsenal will not mind if Rice enjoys similar success to the last individual who proudly held the title of world’s most expensive 24-year-old footballer. Gareth Bale did just fine and the Gunners believe their new record signing could be one of the many jigsaw pieces.",

      "26 – Harry Maguire (£80m, Leicester to Man Utd in August 2019)\nNot only did Maguire usurp Virgil van Dijk as the most expensive defender ever, he replaced him as the most expensive 26-year-old in history. That really does have to sting. The former Man Utd captain might consider himself to at least be in the same conversation now, if only just listening in the background and awkwardly laughing at all the in-jokes while being hawked around for about a quarter of what he was signed for.",
      "",
      "27 – Luis Suarez (£65m, Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2014)\nAfter arriving with a customary months-long ban for biting, Suarez really did crack on establishing a phenomenal Barcelona legacy. The only player not named Lionel or Cristiano to win the Pichichi Trophy for La Liga top scorer between 2010 and 2021, Suarez also claimed 13 trophies and a place at number three on the Blaugrana’s list of all-time top scorers. Then when they let the Uruguayan go for free he fired Atletico to the title while fuelled on pure thirst for revenge.",
      "",
      "28 – Eden Hazard (£143m, Chelsea to Real Madrid in July 2019)\nIf you had told Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 that Hazard would activate all the clauses in his Chelsea transfer to take it from an £88.5m deal to the full value of £143m, they would presumably have been chuffed at the success the Belgian must have enjoyed. But those add-ons were accidentally triggered across four seasons utterly ruined by injury, before being released with 12 months of his contract remaining and then retiring.",
      "",
      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",
      "",
      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",

      "Joao Pedro has joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m. Will Alexander Isak be among them soon?",
      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "23) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "22) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "21) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "20) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "19) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "18) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "17) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "15) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "According to reports, six Manchester City stars are on the ‘chopping block’ after the Club World Cup, with the ‘most high-profile’ exit ‘almost certain’.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out."

      "",
      "9) Atletico Madrid – £56.22m\nAlex Baena has arrived from Villarreal for biggish money, becoming the second major signing of the summer after Matteo Ruggeri from Atalanta.",
      "",
      "8) Burnley – £60.47m\nThe Clarets have been the biggest spenders among the clubs promoted to the Premier League, with £13m Loum Tchaouna the most expensive signing, with Bashir Humphreys not far behind.",
      "",
      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",
      "",
      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United – £66.8m\nThey have completed one of the most expensive transfers of the summer so far with the capture of Wolves maverick Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo possibly to follow. And Diego Leon has joined for a few extra quid.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £154.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",

      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
