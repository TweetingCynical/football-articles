      "Cristiano Ronaldo took Anderson and Nani under his wing when they signed for Manchester United in 2007, letting them live at his house and driving them into training",
      "Anderson has revealed he and Nani used to sleep on stretchers at Manchester United's training ground after getting a lift from Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Both Anderson and Nani joined United in 2007 and Ronaldo immediately took the pair under his wing, allowing them to stay at his house and driving them to training. They lived with Ronaldo for \"almost a year\", with Anderson admitting the Portuguese superstar would have been happy with them staying longer.",
      "\"As soon as I arrived, I went to Cristiano's house,\" Anderson said in an interview with Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte. \"I thank him very much. He adopted me. We lived at Ronaldo's house for almost a year. We left because we wanted to leave.",
      "\"For him we could have stayed there. We didn't spend anything. The guy took us to training, fed us, had a cook for us. There was a swimming pool inside and outside the house, a jacuzzi, and a tennis court.\"",
      "Anderson also provided some insight into Ronaldo's mentality, revealing the forward would travel to Carrington for training three hours before it was due to start and that he and Nani would take a nap while waiting for everyone else to arrive.",
      "\"Training was at 9:30 am, but sometimes we had to go at 6:30 am, because Ronaldo was at the club and we went with him,\" Anderson added. \"Nani and I slept there on the stretchers and waited because his work had to start.",
      "\"If I had 5 per cent of CR7's mentality, I would be among the 20 best midfielders at that time. That Brazilian side of us bothered me... Thinking that we've already won everything and everything is resolved. Of not wanting something a little more.\"",
      "Anderson's comments are echoed by those who worked with the midfielder, with former United coach Mick Clegg saying he was \"more than capable of being an absolute stormer of a player\" but he simply \"chose not to put in the work\". He told the  Athletic  in 2022: \"You could never find a nicer person — he was popular with everyone — but he was a lazy bleeder.",
      "\"He always had his excuses. I used to have a stick and I said to Alex Ferguson very early on, 'If he carries on, I'm going to hit him with my bleeding stick'. Fergie couldn't believe it. 'Don't you dare. He cost me a lot of money. You can't be hitting one of my players, are you mad?'.",
      "\"Then, six weeks later, Fergie came to find me. 'Where's that bloody stick?', he said. 'Give me that stick. I want to hit him'. Anderson was more than capable of being an absolute stormer of a player.",
      "\"Anderson was more than capable of being an absolute stormer of a player. He just needed his head knocking. He didn't keep fit. He chose not to put in the work, so it's hard to have too much sympathy for him. He was a party animal.\""

      "Manchester United are coming out of the January transfer window with a seriously trimmed squad, but the summer may well allow them to dip into the market once more",
      "January proved to be a quiet month for Manchester United once again, with Erik ten Hag's side busy on the pitch on deadline day but quiet in the transfer market in its final throes.",
      "Back in December, football director John Murtough indicated the club didn't see the January window as a period to do significant business. Even so, some might have hoped for a last-minute surprise akin to the loan swoop for Marcel Sabitzer 12 months ago.",
      "It wasn't to be, though, and the last month has been all about outgoings for United. More than a dozen players have moved on, either on loan or permanently, with Isak Hansen-Aaroen's late departure underlining where the club's priorities lay.",
      "The summer is different, though, or at least it could be. United's plans are likely to be impacted by their league finish, with uncertainty over their European involvement next term, and a failure to reach the Champions League could impact the calibre of player willing to join.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival likely to be followed by a statement signing or two, Mirror Football has assessed some of the options. And if United can offload some members of the current squad, there could be even more money to put towards new arrivals.",
      "United have not been afraid to do business with Atalanta over the years, with mixed results. Rasmus Hojlund has finally begun to kick into gear in the Premier League after a slow start, but winger Amad has found things tougher for a variety of reasons.",
      "Next up could be Scalvini. The centre-back only turned 20 in December, but has been a Serie A regular for more than a year and scored his first European goal against Sporting CP earlier this season.",
      "After being handed his international debut by Roberto Mancini in 2022, the youngster admitted he was comfortable in midfield as well as in his preferred role at centre-back. With questions over the longer-term future of Victor Lindelof and Raphael Varane, a younger model could be just the ticket.",
      "Speaking of young centre-backs, Branthwaite is a little older than Scalvini at 21 but would come with Premier League experience. The England under-21 international has impressed at the back for Everton this term, while also got regular top-flight football last season under Ruud van Nistelrooy at PSV Eindhoven.",
      "United were among several clubs linked with a January swoop for the ex-Carlisle man, with some reports suggesting he might set them back around £40m. Whether that fee remains the same come June, with question marks over Everton's need to cash in, remains in the balance.",
      "\"I think when all of those clubs are interested and watching your games, it's gonna be one of them where you take notice,\" Branthwaite exclusively told Mirror Football in May amid reports of interest from United and Roma. Since then, though, Sean Dyche has shown he sees him as a key player and Everton are unlikely to let him leave without a fight.",
      "Benfica star Neves was another mentioned in connection with United in January, only for his club to firmly deny any talks had begun. \"Sport Lisboa e Benfica denies the existence of any right of preference over its player João Neves,\" the Portuguese giants said.",
      "\"Under no circumstances did Sport Lisboa e Benfica enter into talks with Manchester United or any other club about this player from their formation – nor does it intend to do so – so any information that points in another direction is false,\" the statement continued. Based on Neves' form, though, links can hardly be considered a surprise.",
      "The 19-year-old has played 19 league games this season, scoring once from his defensive midfield berth. He also didn't miss a minute in the Champions League as Benfica finished third in their group behind Real Sociedad and Internazionale.",
      "Erik ten Hag admitted Financial Fair Play concerns stood in the way of United adding another striker in January. Anthony Martial's injury saw the club explore what might be possible, and the Frenchman could well leave in the summer to leave a gap.",
      "There are several candidates to fill that gap, and Brighton striker Ferguson is among them. If Ten Hag wants young talent, the Irishman - who scored his first Premier League hat-trick earlier this season - certainly ticks the boxes.",
      "Ferguson signed a new long-term contract with Brighton in 2023, so any hopes of a cut-price deal might be far-fetched. Still, the Irish international would be seen as an investment for now and in the future, similar to summer signing Hojlund.",
      "On the subject of FFP, another team unable to spent in January was Newcastle United. Indeed, Eddie Howe's men may need to sell before they can buy, with Bruno Guimaraes already being linked with some of the Premier League's big hitters.",
      "The Brazilian's quality is evident, as is his ability to cut it in the Premier League. Newcastle won't want to sell one of their key men, but there have been suggestions they might have little choice.",
      "Of course, United themselves might need to find takers for some of their current squad members to fit in a swoop. If Casemiro's Saudi Pro League links bear fruit, though, then fans may well dare to dream."

      "He told Sky Sports: \"With Fernandes on the right, the midfield looks all over the place and the front three doesn't look capable of functioning as one. Does he go back to McTominay? Ten Hag has made five substitutions and not used him. It's almost as if he is managing him out of the club.\"",

      "United were unable to add to their squad in January despite seeing Anthony Martial ruled out for 10 weeks after undergoing surgery on a groin complaint. Ten Hag, 54, believes he will need to be creative to help the 13-times Premier League champions meet their objectives this season.",
      "The club currently sit in seventh in the Premier League and remain in with a chance of lifting the FA Cup. United put three points between themselves and Newcastle and Brighton with a dramatic win over Wolves on Thursday, narrowing the gap to fourth-placed Tottenham to eight points.",
      "In the absence of deadline day signings, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund set Ten Hag's side up for victory as both netted in United's win. However, both players had been substituted when United were in search of a goal after a dramatic Wolves comeback saw the teams level after 95 minutes.",
      "Omari Forson, 19, was brought on to replace Hojlund and the midfielder provided the assist for fellow youth prospect Kobbie Mainoo to produce a 97th-minute winner. With the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules seeing a careful approach to the window, Ten Hag will need to hope similar combinations can continue to come up trumps to provide depth.",
      "“I think it’s not a secret that I wanted a striker extra,\" said Ten Hag on Friday, \"Because with the injury of Martial we don’t really have back-up there, but it was not possible because we have to match the FFP rules.",

      "United saw the likes of Jadon Sancho, Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri and Facundo Pellistri depart the club on loan, in addition to permanent moves for Mateo Mejia and Isak Hansen-Aaroen. That was not enough to provide room for the club to manoeuvre after significant spending in the summer.",
      "Ten Hag sanctioned the arrivals of Hojlund, Andre Onana and Mason Mount over the summer for almost £200million. The Manchester United boss does not believe a good team is produced through sales, however.",
      "“There are some disadvantages on FFP,” Ten Hag said. “So, to make space for FFP, you actually have to sell players and you have to sell good players and I don’t think that’s the way how you build a team.”"

      "Rasmus Hojlund has now scored four goals in his last five games for Manchester United and the striker is confident that Erik ten Hag's can enjoy a much improved second half of the season",
      "Rasmus Hojlund never had any doubts that he would score goals for Manchester United.",
      "‌United’s £72 million striker had to wait until December to break his Premier League duck - but has now found the target in four of his last five outings. Hojlund’s tally for the season now stands at a respectable nine, although the Danish international also started to weigh in with assists as Erik ten Hag has rescued the Reds’ season by plotting a five-game unbeaten run.",
      "Hojlund said: “Of course, if you asked me, I would have loved to score my first goal in September or October. I knew I could score goals. I had shown it in the Champions League and at my previous clubs.",
      "“But, of course, opening the account means it’s like ‘Okay, I can do it’. It’s good to see. I hope we can keep going, keep the confidence in the team and keep providing for each other. I think that’s the key. We’re all being selfish when we have to but we also play for each other.”",
      "‌Hojlund has become best pals with Kobbie Mainoo, the Manchester-born teenage midfielder who is enjoying a breakthrough season. Mainoo scored the dramatic injury-time winner that secured a 4-3 victory at Wolves on Tuesday night after United had squandered a 3-1 lead.",
      "‌Hojlund said: “We enjoy spending time together. The young guys have a little group where we're chatting to each other and it's very cool to have other young players around the team. Hopefully we can set an era for the club and be here many years together.",
      "“If you're good enough, you're old enough and I think that's a good thing. We're here for a reason. You can see Kobbie’s composure. He is so relaxed on the ball. Now he's also starting to show that he has the scoring parts of his game as well. He's a complete player.”",
      "“The way he manoeuvres in tight situations and the way he manipulates this ball and uses his body at times. He shifts it, pops it through [Max] Kilman’s legs – beautiful.",
      "“He’s elusive at times as well and the control and the awareness to pick his spot. Some players see the headlines there and the back pages and think ‘I’m going to go for it’. But he just caresses it.”"

      "Manchester United's dramatic 4-3 win over Wolves showed the direction Erik ten Hag must take with his squad after years of wasting money on expensive flops in the transfer market",
      "Erik ten Hag's outlook at Manchester United would be bleak without the vital contributions of his academy graduates.‌",
      "Three of United’s four goalscorers in the rollercoaster win at Wolves on Thursday night – Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Kobbie Mainoo – came through the ranks at Old Trafford. Throw in Alejandro Garnacho, who joined the United academy as a 16-year-old, and Omari Forson, who set up Mainoo’s fantastic 97th-minute winner at Molineux, and Ten Hag has a core of young talent who should give him hope for the future.",
      "Those youngsters may not have saved the manager’s job – but Ten Hag would be in even greater difficulty without them. And although the current crop are not yet rivals to the Class of 92’s David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and the Neville brothers, they have produced the goods where too many of Ten Hag’s expensive recruits have been poor.",
      "Throwing another £100million at the transfer market does not always solve a big club’s problems on the pitch. Sometimes the answer lies closer to home – and Manchester United’s academy has always been a special nursery for young talent.",
      "In a market where billions change hands, the most valuable discoveries are often found on your doorstep.‌ Former Match of the Day pundit Alan Hansen famously said “You can’t win anything with kids’ almost 30 years ago – and the Class of 92 proved him spectacularly wrong.",
      "But take away McTominay’s two injury-time goals against Brentford, take away Mainoo’s brilliant winner at Wolves, take away Garnacho’s sensational overhead kick at Everton and United’s highlights reel this season would be desperately thin.",
      "‌Those McTominay goals and Mainoo’s first Premier League strike were worth an extra four points on the board alone – the difference between United being seventh and in the bottom half of the table.",
      "Lots of people have had their say on Rashford and his ill-advised trip to Belfast, but he provided the right response at Molineux. He was wrong. But when you think it’s eight years since his first goal for United, there is an opportunity for him now to become the leader of this generation of academy graduates.",
      "They cost virtually nothing, but how much would Rashford, Garnacho, Mainoo, McTominay and Forson be worth now? I’ll start the bidding at £300m. One thing’s for sure, and it’s been the same story at Manchester United down the years – if you’re good enough, you’re old enough to make the first team.",
      "Last month, I observed that Liverpool’s title challenge was being underpinned by home-grown youngsters like Trent Alexander-Arnold, Curtis Jones and Conor Bradley, who was absolutely outstanding in their 4-1 demolition of Chelsea in midweek. It’s great to see two of our biggest clubs keeping their conveyor belts of scouted young talent in good order.‌",
      "On the whole, Ten Hag’s big-money buys have been poor, but his judgement has been vindicated in terms of promoting youth at Old Trafford. Who knows? In the same way that a Mark Robins goal at Nottingham Forest was reputed to rescue Sir Alex Ferguson from the sack in 1990, they may even save his job.",
      "One more thing about Manchester United. When was the last time they had a negative goal difference after 22 games of a Premier League season?"

      "Gary Neville's early season assessment of Scott McTominay's  Manchester United prospects have not aged well six months down the line.",
      "Back in August, after the Scotland international was an unused substitute for the 2-0 defeat away at Tottenham, United legend Neville clearly feared for McTominay's future at Old Trafford. In fairness, he wasn't the only one left confused by Ten Hag's decision to leave the midfielder on the bench when it seemed clear that someone of his profile was required.",
      "However, the Dutchman clearly disagreed, prompting Neville to make the bold claim that the United boss wants rid of McTominay. He told Sky Sports: \"What's clear is that Manchester United's midfield needs bolstering.",
      "\"Ten Hag wants a number six who can play alongside Casemiro and, at the moment, the club can't get players out to be able to fund that. If they look at the first two weeks, they have to fund it or there will be a big problem. What is clear is that Ten Hag doesn't want to revert back to Scott McTominay.",
      "\"With Fernandes on the right, the midfield looks all over the place and the front three doesn't look capable of functioning as one. Does he go back to McTominay? Ten Hag has made five substitutions and not used him. It's almost as if he is managing him out of the club.\"",
      "Fast forward to February and McTominay is as integral to the United cause as he has ever been. The 27-year-old is the club's leading goalscorer in the league so far with six strikes to his name, including a vital header late on during the 4-3 win over Wolves on Thursday.",
      "McTominay's clearly loving life under Ten Hag's guidance, recently singing his praises on the High Performance Podcast. The United ace explained: \"He's an amazing manager with great tactical dimensions to his game. Some of the things he says and how he conducts his meetings are brilliant and I just want to be a part of that.\"",
      "The feeling is mutual judging by the manager's recent remarks. After handing the Scotsman the armband at Anfield, the United boss said: \"I think he is one of the examples of what it means to play for Manchester United, to play with the badge on his heart.",
      "\"He is an example, and the others cantake thatand build on him. I'm sure he will be a communicator; I'm sure he will be an example of passion and desire, and you need that in these games.\""

      "The incident in question took place after Bellingham tackled the Manchester United loanee near the touchline. Having caught Greenwood in possession and clearing the ball out for a throw in, television cameras showed the Real Madrid superstar mutter something in the direction of Greenwood, but there was no audio to confirm what was said.",

This conclusion is strongly influenced by the specific context in which the word was used.",

      "Villa subsequently progressed through to the quarter-finals as group runners-up behind Sunderland, alongside fellow WSL club Tottenham Hotspur, while United were denied passage based on points-per-game.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the decision, Skinner said: \"I don't believe there's scope to challenge it. It's obviously disappointing but it's something you have to take. I don't believe we have the opportunity to have any input in it because we aren’t a team involved within that game. That's all we know.”",

United, who were one of the biggest spenders in the summer, currently sit 10 points off leaders Chelsea and seven points off Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Addressing the dearth in incomings, Skinner said: “We always said, it's about bringing the right people in. The team will not spend money that we waste, we don't want to waste money.",

      "Academy product Mainoo had other ideas however as he showed a deft touch to cut past Kilman from the left before curling the ball past Jose Sa. His 54-year-old manager was pleased to see that the young charge kept going.",
      "\"He is making incredible progress. He has great abilities is the modern midfield player. He can defend and attack but also he has the physicality to do both ways. He is also composed.\"",
      "United's boss also reserved some praise for Rashford. The forward missed training last week after being pictured in a Northern Ireland night club just hours before, and required showdown talks on Monday.",
      "The Red Devils revealed the England international 'accepted responsibility' over an internal matter on Monday and he returned immediately to Ten Hag's starting lineup. The 26-year-old wasted little time in making an impact and fired a strike into the corner to open the scoring against Wolves.",
      "Ten Hag believes that Rashford is trending in the right direction despite his indiscretion. The forward has contributed against Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham and Wolves in his most recent Premier League matches.",
      "United's boss added: \"A great goal. He has three goals and and an assist in four games. The form is coming.’"

      "Left than £100million was spent on deadline day this January in what was an underwhelming month of recruitment with a number of top clubs opting against investing",
      "The January transfer window of 2024 will not live very long in the memory.",
      "For a bit of context, Chelsea spent more this time last year to land Enzo Fernandez than every Premier League club did on Thursday. Less than £100million was laid out as the day, which often threatens fireworks, hardly had its spark lit.",
      "The whole month was largely underwhelming with top clubs opting against making any major moves. There was talk of some potential movement - Arsenal were in need of a striker but failed to act on that. Manchester United welcomed Sir Jim Ratcliffe into the fold, but he will wait until the summer to flex his muscles.",
      "Newcastle, who want to remain compliant with the league's financial rules, considered selling but no one ended up leaving St James' Park. Tottenham bought Timo Werner back to the Premier League, but he was possibly the most high profile mover, which in itself says a lot.",
      "It seemed as though few clubs responded to the calls to add in certain areas. Almost every manager seems ready to stick with his pack, unwilling to shuffle at the midway point of the season. The status quo remained all the way until the end of deadline day, when clubs could be forgiven for making a late call.",
      "Those in the relegation scrap, the likes of Sheffield United, were calculated in their moves. Ben Brereton Diaz had already been brought in and Mason Holgate added to that, but both men arrived on loan with the Blades opting against throwing millions at a survival bid.",
      "Luton Town and Burnley were similarly coy. The Clarets landed Chelsea's David Datro Fofana on loan and also bought in some French recruits.",
      "At the top, any suggestions that the top six and those around them needed reinforcements were largely ignored. Newcastle are set for a busy summer but, like several of their rivals, are wary of the penalties for breaching financial rules. Heavy spending from the likes of Arsenal and United in the summer also hampered their ambitions.",
      "Ivan Toney was among those to be linked with a mega-money move after his return to football, but he remains a Brentford player and is will take a huge sum to prise him away from west London",
      "At Old Trafford it was a month of departures with Erik ten Hag getting a host of players off his squad list, which was a theme throughout the month. Facundo Pellistri was a late loan exit, heading off to Granada. He followed the likes of Jadon Sancho and Donny van de Beek who had left earlier in January. All in all United let more than 10 players depart the club this month.",
      "The club’s director of football John Murtough had previously said: \"We’ve always been consistent in saying that we do not see January as the optimal time to do business and our recruitment strategy remains focused on summer windows.\"",
      "Ratcliffe very much took on a watching berth throughout the first month of the year with his biggest signing coming off the pitch in the form of Omar Berrada. Anyone who has watched United knows however that the squad needs addressing in the summer.",
      "The Blues, perhaps for the first time in the Todd Boehly era, showed some restraint when it came to getting out the cheque book. The American has thrown sums at the first-team, albeit with little success, bringing in a host of big names.",
      "On deadline day though Chelsea were rather quiet with their main focus on getting Armando Broja out of the club. He didn't go far, heading to Fulham on loan for the season. Originally the club wanted to sell him for £50m, then said he could leave on loan with an obligation to buy.",
      "Eventually just a loan deal was negotiated with Mauricio Pochettino opting to persevere with some of the club's other forward options. Broja previously impressed on loan at Southampton several years ago, but has struggled for opportunities since then.",
      "At just 22 time is on his side and there is an obvious talent there. Chelsea have often seen their academy as a way of making money - not necessarily as a way of producing talent. Broja would not be the first Blues player whom they deemed surplus to requirements only to go on and achieve big things.",
      "He might only be leaving on loan, thus returning in the summer, but it seems as though the hierarchy see Broja as an asset they can cash in on. A promising loan spell is likely to only increase his transfer value, not increase his Chelsea hopes.",
      "Broja could yet be the next player we look at and wonder 'how did they sell him?' Much like we do with Kevin De Bruyne and Mohamed Salah."

      "Ten Hag and director of football John Murtough had made it clear in the run-up to January that United would not be using the window to bolster their ranks. Instead, the month turned into an all-out effort to reduce numbers rather than increase them.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team set to take over soon and Omar Berrada arriving as chief executive, a new era is about to start. Ratcliffe has made it clear that he thinks United’s poor recruitment is one of the main things holding them back. He intends to change how things are run and United have cleared the decks before he is officially the owner of 25 per cent of the club.",
      "Last January they signed Marcel Sabitzer and Wout Weghorst on loan, while former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer loaned Odion Ighalo in 2020. But there were no such short-term punts this time around. There were no signings whatsoever made in January – but a whopping 13 players were moved on. Deadline day was quiet, partly because United were busy playing Wolves in the Premier League at Molineux, and partly because they had already shifted so many players.",
      "There was one deal completed, with midfielder Isak Hansen-Aaroen completing a permanent move to Werder Bremen. \"Moving to Werder is the right step for me,\" the 19-year-old said. \"I'm happy to have the opportunity to play in the Bundesliga for such a big club.\"",
      "The Norwegian was one of just two permanent transfers done, with Mateo Mejia’s move to Sevilla the only other. Elsewhere, United focused on loaning out players not wanted by Ten Hag. That area was of course headlined by Jadon Sancho moving to Borussia Dortmund and Donny van de Beek heading to Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Sergio Reguilon’s loan from Tottenham was ended after Luke Shaw ’s return, Hannibal Mejbri joined Sevilla on loan and Facundo Pellistri went to Granada for game time. The other loan deals were mainly for youngsters still some way off Ten Hag’s first-team squad.",
      "There was one signing United were linked with, but Bayern Munich beat them and a number of Premier League rivals to 16-year-old Swedish sensation Jonah Kusi-Asare. United will now look ahead to the summer when Bologna striker Joshua Zirkzee is among a number of players on their radar.",
      "But Murtough’s recent admission explains the strategy for the month just gone. “Looking ahead to the January transfer window, we are not expecting it to be particularly busy,” he said. “There will always be the possibility of deals around the edges of the squad, particularly in terms of finding opportunities for players who are not playing as much football as they would like.",
      "“However, we’ve always been consistent in saying that we do not see January as the optimal time to do business and our recruitment strategy remains focused on summer windows. We’ve seen this season that financial fair play (FFP) rules have real teeth, so we have to be very careful to ensure that we remain compliant, and we will.

      "Manchester United have had a quiet January, and this should perhaps come as no surprise following comments from football director John Murtough about the month not being the best time to do business.",
      "United spent around £200m over the summer, with Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Andre Onana accounting for the bulk of that total. There hasn't been a single new senior arrival in January, though, with United instead trimming their squad by loaning out the likes of Jadon Sancho, Hannibal Mejbri and Facundo Pellistri.",
      "It's a similar story to this time last year, though United were at least able to dip into the loan market. Deadline day arrival Marcel Sabitzer made some important contributions, but Ten Hag might not even be able to bring in a fresh face on a short-term deal this time around.",
      "Familiar doesn't always mean popular, of course, and there will be some United fans still frustrated by the lack of business. Even so, previous comments from Murtough align with the current situation.",
      "“Looking ahead to the January transfer window, we are not expecting it to be particularly busy,\" Murtough told a fans' forum in December. \"There will always be the possibility of deals around the edges of the squad, particularly in terms of finding opportunities for players who are not playing as much football as they would like.",

      "A number of the players loaned out by United in January could yet leave permanently in the summer. Sevilla reportedly have a £17m option to sign Hannibal permanently if he impresses in Spain, while Alvaro Fernandez Carreras is expected to be available to loan side Benfica for about half that amount.",
      "United's slow start to the season has left them far adrift of the Premier League's top five, prompting some to wonder whether more incomings were needed in January. However, manager Erik ten Hag may have also hinted at a quiet January when speaking of the importance of some senior stars' returns from injury.",
      "\"I think we are very optimistic,\" Ten Hag said at the end of December. \"When the players return and now the luck is a little bit on our side in the matter of injuries then we have five or six new signings in January.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been given the green light to move Manchester United away from Old Trafford – but the INEOS billionaire is unlikely to take up the offer.",
      "Ratcliffe is still waiting for his £1.3billion deal for 25 per cent of the club to be officially ratified. But the 71-year-old is already putting plans in place for his arrival, with his right-hand man Sir Dave Brailsford overseeing the sporting side of things at the club.",
      "There are also plans afoot surrounding Old Trafford, which desperately needs renovating for United to keep up with their rivals. As a club statement confirmed on December 24: “Sir Jim will provide a $300million (£235m) fund intended to enable future investment into the club’s infrastructure at Old Trafford, comprising $200m paid upon the closing of the transaction and a further $100m by the end of 2024.”",
      "That money could be used in a variety of ways and the Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has now confirmed that he held “exciting” talks with Ratcliffe about what the future might hold.",
      "Burnham told BBC Radio Manchester: “We are absolutely standing behind the club. Whatever it is they want, we will facilitate and we will be there to make sure the club is set up for the future. There is exciting potential here. I am talking to the club and I may be seeing them next week as well.",
      "“Sir Jim Ratcliffe has really brought a lot of energy to the situation. Sir Dave Brailsford is a brilliant person. [He is] the architect of the success of British cycling over the last couple of decades and the velodrome in Manchester.",
      "“We’re really backing the club. We’re not trying to steer them anywhere, we are just saying whatever you decide, if it’s refurbishing Old Trafford or building a new ground, we will stand behind the club and make sure the plan works.”",
      "Ratcliffe spoke briefly about Old Trafford last year and he confirmed he would not consider renaming the club's home. \"I hadn't thought of that, but no,\" he replied when asked about stadium naming rights. \"That would be heresy. I would not change it. It's always Old Trafford.\"",
      "And the boyhood United fan has also reportedly ruled out building an entire new stadium, instead preferring to renovate Old Trafford. He said in his statement in December: “Whilst the commercial success of the club has ensured there have always been available funds to win trophies at the highest level, this potential has not been fully unlocked in recent times. We will bring the global knowledge, expertise and talent from the wider INEOS Sport group to help drive further improvement at the club, while also providing funds intended to enable future investment into Old Trafford.",
      "“We are here for the long term and recognise that a lot of challenges and hard work lie ahead, which we will approach with rigour, professionalism and passion. We are committed to working with everyone at the club – the board, staff, players and fans – to help drive the club forward.”"

      "Rio Ferdinand has compared Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo to AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf after his winner against Wolves.",
      "Mainoo produced a stunning piece of skill and composure to net a 97th-minute winner for United at Molineux on Thursday night. Pedro Neto appeared to have earned Wolves a point when he netted in the 95th minute, but Mainoo found the bottom corner two minutes later in an entertaining 4-3 win.",
      "It was the young midfielder’s second goal for United in four days after he also scored in the 4-2 win over Newport County in the FA Cup. Former United defender Ferdinand was full of praise for Mainoo while analysing his winning goal.",
      "“He shifts it, pops it through [Max] Kilman’s legs – beautiful. He’s elusive at times as well and the control and the awareness to pick his spot. Some players see the headlines there and the back pages and think ‘I’m going to go for it’. But he just caresses it.”",
      "Mainoo’s winner came after a seesawing match in which United had raced into a 2-0 lead thanks to Marcus Rashford ’s curling finish and Rasmus Hojlund’s bundled effort at the near post. Pablo Sarabia’s penalty was then cancelled out by Scott McTominay’s header before a grandstand finish.",
      "Kilman scored from a set piece before Neto scored on the counter-attack to make it 3-3 and set the stage for Mainoo. \"It's a dream come true. It's such a tough place to come,” he said. “They've had such a good home run here, so we had to get the win. I've still not come down from it. I still feel like I'm dreaming to be honest.",
      "\"To start playing in the Premier League for my boyhood club, it's been amazing and I'm now just trying to get a good run of games in, win more and more games and get real momentum going.\"",
      "Hojlund was impressed by the youngster. “I didn’t get to see him in pre-season because I wasn’t there, but all of the lads were talking about him and saying he is a generational talent,” he said. “He has a nice body type, he is very mature and has a good personality as well.",
      "\"He’s very calm, and outside the pitch he’s a nice, relaxed guy. You can see he’s composed and shows his quality, and he showed it again tonight - he’s an incredible talent. He’s only 18 years old, and I thought I was young.",
      "Bruno Fernandes said: \"He's a big talent. I've said it in the past – I've seen him play for the under-18s two or three years ago and I said to a friend who was in Manchester who wanted to see some youth games, I said the name of Kobbie, without knowing he was going to be this talented and this player. The talent was there. But he's better as a kid than a player. He will be in the future equally.\""

      "It was one of the most incredible games of the season with a sensational sting in the tail as Manchester United somehow came out on top in a seven goal thriller. And even Marcus Rashford’s return from the naughty step was overshadowed by United teenager Kobbie Mainoo when he snatched the 97th minute winner.",
      "It was sheer chaos as United twice threw away a two-goal advantage, they were 3-1 up with just four minutes to go before Wolves staged an incredible fight back. And yet it finished United’s way as Erik ten Hag, his coaching staff and all of the substitutes raced onto the pitch to celebrate Mainoo's last gasp winner.",
      "What a finish. What an incredible game. You just cannot beat the Premier League for sheer entertainment and drama.",
      "But United should be scratching their heads as to how on earth they made it so difficult for themselves because they were outstanding in the first half. Rashford, straight back into the starting line-up after a week on the naughty step after his nightclub antics in Belfast, was electric.",
      "England star Rashford scored, played a part in Rasmus Hojlund’s second and he fully repaid Ten Hag’s faith in him. It was clever man management by Ten Hag but it would have looked weak if Rashford had not delivered. Instead, Rashford was superb and his brilliance rubbed off on Hojlund.",
      "When they are at their best, United are a force to be reckoned with and could still have a say in the European places. When they press the self destruct button - as they nearly did late on - they are still horribly vulnerable and unpredictable.",
      "That was why Wolves - who had a rare off night - came back, never gave up and so nearly embarrassed the visitors with a brilliant comeback. It all started so well for United. They were ahead after five minutes and it had to be Rashford who finally let his football do the talking.",
      "After a nice build-up down the right, Hojlund held up the ball nicely and then laid it off to Rashford who curled the ball home from the edge of the box. What a start. It did not take much longer for a second goal. And this time it was Rashford’s understanding with Luke Shaw which really paid dividends.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho’s ball found Rashford, his slick pass sent Shaw down the wing on the overlap and the England left back’s near post cross was turned in by Hojlund who bravely threw himself at the ball to get the final touch. That is four in as many games for Hojlund.",
      "Wolves were tepid but were gifted a 71st minute penalty after Neto danced into the penalty box, Casemiro’s challenge made the slightest of contact but referee Jarred Gillett pointed to the spot and VAR upheld the decision.",
      "Pablo Sarabia smashed home the penalty to give Wolves hope at 2-1. But that did not last long. Scott McTominay came on for Casemiro and United’s substitute scored within a minute as he stooped to head home Bruno Fernandes' corner. 3-1.",
      "That should have been game over. But the drama was just starting. Craig Dawson’s shot fell to Max Kilman who forced home to make it 3-2 after 86 minutes and set up a grandstand finish - and that certainly arrived.",
      "Neto made it 3-3 in the 95th minute with a low shot and the home fans went wild as they thought they had grabbed a point. But Mainoo saved United’s night with a 97th minute decider as he drove forward, cut inside and then fired into the bottom corner with a great goal worthy of winning such a great game."

      "Chelsea and Newcastle were also approached by the striker's entourage but it's understood that none of the three took up the opportunity. Ten Hag worked with Haller during his time at Ajax, where he scored 47 times in 66 appearances, leading the United boss to describe the Ivory Coast international as 'phenomenal'.",
      "I think we can all agree that Kobbie Mainoo is a very talented footballer.",
      "Since coming into the Man United first team the midfielder has been unreal. And Rasmus Hojlund believes the 18-year-old is a geneational talent.",
      "“I think it’s hard to sum it up,” summer signing Hojlund said after the chaotic clash. “A little bit annoyed because we switch off a little bit but so happy for us in the end. A generational talent in Kobbie Mainoo. He did well.”",
      "While there is no doubt Ten Hag is facing mounting pressure at United, it seems extremely unlikely Mourinho will be his successor if Ratcliffe fires the Dutchman.",
      "Going back to a manager who has had his turn at trying to resurrect United would be a left-field appointment by INEOS.",
      "At the weekend, reports suggested Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise would prefer a move to United over other Premier League clubs due to being a supporter of the Reds.",
      "However, in a conversation with BritishGambler.co.uk, Alan Smith told United not to rush a deal:",
      "I feel like I wouldn’t be rushing into anything at this moment in time. That’s where United have been over the last few years with their recruitment policy. This again might be ‘are we jumping in because we need something?' For Man United not to get Champions League this year, everyone will see as a big problem, but if you’re gonna rebuild, make sure that the structure is correct and you’re buying the correct personnel. We aren’t just buying someone for this transfer window, we are buying them for five years. It might sound like we are giving up this season, but we can’t just keep throwing money at it and see if it works, and that has never been the Man United way.",
      "Continuing his interview with BritishGambler.co.uk, Smith has urged United to make sure they do their proper homework on Olise before falling into the same mistake as when they signed Zaha.",
      "I think regardless of who they are, it needs to the right fit – do the characteristics fit. Are we going down the same route as the signing of Wilfried Zaha? There’s a huge difference between playing for Crystal Palace and Man United and sometimes if you’ve not done the research on the player’s personality, you’re taking a chance on anybody coming to Man United. Have they played at a huge club? Have they played at a club that demands the same expectations as Man United? That’s where the short-term of going do we just sign someone because we need somebody, instead of signing someone for the future of the club.",
      "The January transfer window is closed and Man United now must wait until the summer to be able to make any signings for Erik ten Hag's squad.",
      "The Premier League are expected to announce the exact dates when the summer transfer window will re-open. Last year, the window opened on Wednesday, June 14 and closed on Friday, September 1.",
      "This year, the summer window is likely to open around the same time.",
      "How's this for a comparison?",
      "Rio Ferdinand has compared Man United teenage sensation Kobbie Mainoo to Clarence Seedorf after his match-winner against Wolves on Thursday. \"I’m not saying he’s of the same ability and he’s that player yet, but you give me the signs, this gives me the vibes of Clarence Seedorf,’ Ferdinand said.",
      "\"The way you can manoeuvre in tight situations, and the way he manipulates his ball, uses his body at times, but then shifts it and just just pops it through the legs of [Max] Kilman there. Beautiful.",
      "\"Elusive at times as well. Just the control and the awareness to be able to pick his spot there. Some players see the headlights there, and the back pages, and think “I’m just gonna go for it”. He just caressed it.\"",
      "The January transfer window is officially closed and unsurprisingly, the spending by Premier League clubs dipped significantly on previous years.",
      "Only £100million was spent in the top flight, the lowest spend in a non-Covid season since 2012 (£60m). It is significantly lower than the £815m that was spent last year.",
      "Nevertheless, United managed to complete some crucial outgoings for the second half of the season.",
      "The January transfer window has now closed with United one of many clubs not to have signed anyone.",
      "This was expected after club officials said they did not anticipate much activity before Erik ten Hag revealed last week that there was no space for even loan arrivals amid FFP.",
      "Several loan exits were sanctioned, though. Jadon Sancho and Donny van de Beek were among them and they may well have played their final game for United.",
      "Meanwhile, Dan Gore, Hannibal Mejbri and Facundo Pellistri are three players who have scured midseason loan exits.",
      "Jesse Lingard has been lined up for a shock transfer to South Korean side FC Seoul - according to Sky Sports.",
      "The 31-year-old totted-up 232 appearances for United after progressing through their academy system but has a free agent since leaving Nottingham Forest last summer.",
      "Lingard was allowed to leave Old Trafford on a free transfer in 2022 and promptly signed for Forest following their return to the top-flight.",

      "The feel-good story in a bad season thus far for Man United is Kobbie Mainoo, who could help them have a successful run-in.",
      "The Manchester United football director John Murtough was struggling for the appropriate word to summarise what he had just witnessed as he wandered up and down the tunnel at Molineux.",
      "United have registered two 97th-minute winners this season, three victories have been secured beyond the 90th minute, they have recovered from 2-0 down to win 3-2 twice and all but four of their triumphs have been won by one goal. Even in a season where United's goal difference is still in minus numbers, there has been more drama than in a West End play.",
      "When Erik ten Hag was almost on his knees against Brentford, Scott McTominay stood tall. Rasmus Hojlund was hunched over a seat and shaking his head in the dugout on Thursday night. Seconds later, he leapt into the arms of Harry Maguire.",
      "As much as United strive to win games as comfortably as possible, winning in the manner that they did at Wolves is the best feeling in sport, never mind football. Kobbie Mainoo, at the age of 18, has followed in the footsteps of Steve Bruce, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Paul Scholes et al. The good and the great have extended the legacy of Fergie Time.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson smiled broadly as the United away-dayers were kept at bay in the Steve Bull Stand. The incumbent United manager showed reasonable restraint as Mainoo jogged towards the moshpit on the far side.",
      "Ten Hag was not the only one. Maguire eschewed the celebrations and pointed to his temple. United had folded at 3-1 and there was still time on the clock. That was on Ten Hag's mind at his post-match press conference.",
      "\"To be honest, I had mixed feelings\" were Ten Hag's first words. He was vexed that United's performance had been undermined by preventable goals when they ought to have ended the night with their goal difference back in the positives.",
      "Ten Hag has not been as strident in his criticism of United when they have won this season and he was perhaps emboldened by the sight of his strongest XI on the pitch in his 94th match in charge. United neared the standards they set last season.",
      "Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez rekindled their Latino alliance in defence, celebrating blocks, tackles and goal kicks. Casemiro was serenaded louder than ever this season, Marcus Rashford's finish had the finesse of some of his clinical strikes last season and United scored four goals in a Premier League match for only the second time under Ten Hag.",
      "Ten Hag's constructive criticism in victory was a recurring theme in a successful 2022-23 campaign. \"Good is not good enough\" was his maxim. That has seldom been heard this season.",
      "Those five words neatly summarised United at Wolves. The first half was their best 45 minutes of the season. Ten Hag argued the performance level extended to an hour. And still United squandered two two-goal leads and sieved three goals in 24 minutes.",
      "It happened in Copenhagen and Istanbul. Mainoo did not start in either of those Champions League ties and, as raw as the 18-year-old is, United would have been in a better place had he avoided that deflating ankle injury in Houston against Real Madrid back in July. Mainoo is a diamond already sharp around the edges.",
      "He is the feel-good story of a bad season thus far for United. It is just as well a Stockport-born academy graduate who still lives with his parents and switches his engine off in the main car park at Carrington has emerged as the long-term linchpin of United's midfield.",
      "That was supposed to be Mason Mount, a £60million signing who has made nine starts in the last year and completed 90 minutes once. When Ten Hag was asked about Mount at Molineux, he spoke with a sombre tone that suggested United matchgoers could go another month without seeing him.",
      "\"He was struggling from the second game of the season,\" Ten Hag said. \"He returned for a period and then picked up another injury, so of course that’s not great.",
      "\"That is very frustrating for him and I really feel for him. I really want to be there for him because he had such high expectations and I had high expectations.\"",
      "Ten Hag added that \"by the end of the season he can stay fit and fight his way into the team, or at least play a role in his team\". The terrible troika of Michael Owen, Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez made a quicker impression than the current United number seven.",
      "This season may well be a write-off for Mount, who had entered the last year of his contract at Chelsea. United have invested £60m to primarily foot his medical bills. Mount has been sidelined for a combined four months as a United player come next week.",
      "Mount was always a dubious choice to pair with Casemiro. In hindsight, United should have invested completely in Mainoo's development, deferred a midfield recruit for another year and put the £60m towards Harry Kane. Easier said than done and the consensus this time last year was United required a dynamic midfielder. Mount never fit that bill but Mainoo does.",
      "The theory that a player's reputation grows when they are out does not hold up with Mount. He struggled so much in his seven starts that no supporter or reporter has lamented his absence. Mainoo's was.",
      "He has already left Murtough speechless.",

      "Man United recorded their first Premier League win of 2024 on Thursday night, beating Wolves 4-3 at Molineux, but it must mark a turning point in their season.",
      "As a flurry of Manchester United supporters started to vacate their golden seats at Molineux, their golden boy forced them to come running back.",
      "With 97 minutes on the clock, Kobbie Mainoo could not have selected a better moment to score his first-ever Premier League goal. Pedro Neto's 95th-minute equaliser had, it seemed, earned Wolves a point, denying United a win that would have been fully merited.",
      "But as United's supporters prepared to criticise those all too familiar failings, such as wasted opportunities and their soft underbelly, Mainoo changed the mindset with a moment of individual brilliance. After dodging two challenges, he entered the penalty area, bent a right-footed effort towards the far corner and sent the away end barmy.",
      "United, to their credit, had produced some of the best football they had played all season, particularly in the first half. They looked menacing every time they went forward, with full-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw providing forward runs to support Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, who netted the second goal as a result of one of Shaw's darts to the byline, was everywhere, chasing every ball and providing a focal point at the top end of the pitch for United to aim at. His combination play with Rashford and Garnacho, as well as Bruno Fernandes, suggests Ten Hag, just as he did against Aston Villa on Boxing Day, has discovered his best trio in attack to unleash United's potential.",
      "When Ten Hag deployed a front-three of Garnacho, Hojlund and Rashford against Villa, United scored three times, staging a brilliant second-half comeback at Old Trafford. On this occasion, United went one better and scored four for the second game running, following last weekend's dispatching of Newport County in the FA Cup at Rodney Parade.",
      "Though only two members of the front-three got on the scoresheet at Molineux, the second-half contributions of Scott McTominay, who put United 3-1 up less than two minutes after coming off the bench, and Mainoo meant United plundered four goals in a Premier League away game for the first time since February 2022 - a 4-2 win over Leeds United at Elland Road under Ralf Rangnick.",
      "Scoring goals by the bucketload has been a problem for United throughout Ten Hag's tenure, highlighted by this season's tally of just 28 in 22 league matches. They have only scored four goals on two occasions in the Premier League under the Dutchman's stewardship.",
      "Nevertheless, though United's soft centre very nearly meant they exited the Black Country with just a point, they did, in the end, secure all three, which their performance so richly deserved. Their first-half showing was their best in a very long time.",
      "After a stop-start January, which featured just one league game, February offers United the opportunity to put together a run of positive results in their bid to climb the table. They are still outsiders to finish in the top four, currently finding themselves eight points shy of Tottenham Hotspur, but the landscape of the Premier League standings can change quickly with a few good results.",
      "Of course, United have been guilty of too many false dawns this season; they followed up a 2-1 win over Chelsea with a 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth three days later in December. This time around, perhaps because of the returns of Lisandro Martinez, Shaw and Casemiro, it feels different.",
      "There was an identity to United's play at Molineux and it translated into scoring four goals in a Premier League game for the first time since May, and the first time in a Premier League away game in two years. Their attack, particularly in the first half, looked menacing, with Rashford hungry to prove a point after last week's off-field events, Hojlund producing a polished performance and Garnacho once again highlighting why he is a better fit on the right wing than Antony.",
      "If United's performance at Molineux was a sign that everything is about to click into place, they need to prove it. West Ham United are up next and the Reds cannot afford to take their foot off the pedal after such a morale-boosting victory.",

      "It began well with six starts in a row following his January move in 2021. But then came the first of a string of serious injuries that have limited him to just 30 appearances in three years. He has spent 935 days injured in his professional career and has been unavailable for 146 games as a result.",
      "FEATURE: I rejected Liverpool to sign for United and then quit City medical for Arsenal",
      "It is staggering to realise Fosu-Mensah has still played for the United first team as many times as he has for Leverkusen and only mustered 1,014 minutes of action in the last three years. Last season, 15 appearances were spread out over just 196 minutes. He hasn't made one competitive appearance so far this campaign.",

He might have feared for his place when Jose Mourinho arrived the following summer but he still featured 11 times under the Portuguese coach, lifting the League Cup and the Europa League in his first term.",

      "Mourinho's treatment of young players is well documented but what was so tough for Fosu-Mensah was that not even key ally Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could find a regular place for him in the squad.",
      "Those two loan exits had been sanctioned by Mourinho and the second was cut short when he suffered a knee ligament injury, which saw him return to United in the closing stages of the 2018–19 season. By the time he returned, there was a new manager in the Old Trafford hot seat.",
      "Fosu-Mensah watched from the sidelines as the United hero went about rebuilding the squad and then, against all the odds, he got opportunities he never expected due to the curtailed pandemic campaign. In June of 2020, Fosu-Mensah made his first United senior matchday squad since May 2017 as he sat on the bench in an FA Cup tie against Norwich.",
      "A month later, with Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams both out injured, Solskjaer called on him to start at left-back ahead of Diogo Dalot against former side Palace at Selhurst Park. He would make another four appearances in the final matches of the season, including in semi-final defeats of both the FA Cup and Europa League.",
      "The Dutch defender was now fully fit, confident, and raring to go into the new campaign. He was desperate to get his chance and he got one right away. Things didn't go according to plan.",
      "He started right back in the opening-day defeat to Crystal Palace but after a poor performance, he was dropped again. Fosu-Mensah only featured from the bench twice more in Champions League defeats away to Istanbul Basaksehir and RB Leipzig.",
      "He would never play for the club again. Fosu-Mensah rejected a new contract as he felt 'undervalued' by the terms offered. Those close to the player insisted he was sad to be leaving but 'excited to get a fresh start and show people what he was really capable of.'",
      "\"It was my decision,\" he later reiterated. \"The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing. I didn’t play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.",
      "“The club and the manager were good to me. I recovered from a big injury; they helped me and gave me minutes. I played in the FA Cup semi-final and the Europa League semi-final. But it’s important to play regularly and to get my opportunity in the national team too.",
      "“Ole has been very good to me. I spoke with him because he had a big injury as a player so he knew exactly how I felt. When I played against Crystal Palace after 16 months, he was very happy for me. These were very good moments. He knew I had the quality. I have no bad things to say about him because he has been very good to me.\"",
      "It's a real shame that three years later he is back where he was to begin with: looking to prove himself after another serious injury. Fosu-Mensah should be praised for taking the risk to leave the club when he had doubts about his future and if there is anyone who deserves a slice of luck, it is him.",
      "Leverkusen and United fans will be happy to see him back. Leroy Sane might not be so happy to face him again.",

      "Match of the Day host Gary Lineker has hailed 'very, very special talent' Michael Olise amid Manchester United transfer links.",
      "The Crystal Palace winger was at his best on Tuesday night as he scored and assisted two in Roy Hodgson's side's 3-2 victory over Sheffield United at Selhurst Park. Olise's star turn in South London took his tally to six goals and three assists in just ten appearances this campaign.",
      "Last weekend, our colleagues at Football.London revealed Olise would prefer a transfer to United in the summer. It is expected the forward will depart Palace at the end of the season considering his form compared to the club's.",
      "Despite keen interest from Chelsea to bring the winger in, Olise would lean towards Erik ten Hag's side because he is a boyhood supporter of the Reds. It is understood last summer, Mauricio Pochettino's side triggered his £35m release clause but the forward chose to stay at Palace and sign a new deal.",
      "Should United choose to make a move for the forward this summer, Lineker has given his seal of approval to the deal. Speaking on this week's The Rest is Football podcast, he said: \"A couple of the best performances we have seen in midweek came from two young Crystal Palace stars, [Eberechi] Eze and Olise.",

      "Guillermo Varela was David Moyes' first signing as Man United manager and there were high hopes for the defender.",
      "The history books show Guillermo Varela was the first signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Varela officially became David Moyes' first signing when joining United from Penarol in June 2013, but many considered the transfer as Ferguson's parting gift.",
      "That's because Varela had undergone a successful trial in the final months of Ferguson's reign and a deal had been negotiated before Moyes took up his position. The legendary Scot believed Varela had the potential to become an outstanding right-back, however, he was unable to nail down a regular starting position under three different United managers.",
      "“I was younger so it was difficult to come to Manchester United and try to play at 20 years old - I'm not Rashford,\" Varela said in an interview with The Sun in 2019.",
      "Varela was just 20 years old when he moved to Manchester and he spent the 2013/14 season playing in the academy before the decision was made to send him on loan.",
      "The defender joined Real Madrid's reserve side, who were managed by Zinedine Zidane. “I was with the Castilla team under Zidane for one year,\" Varela said.",
      "\"I would train two or three times a week with the first team. It was magnificent. With Cristiano, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale as well. I spoke with Cristiano about Manchester United. Chicharito (Hernández) moved at the same time with me. We lived separately but he was very helpful.”",
      "Varela made 33 appearances for Real Madrid Castilla and he was named in the first team's squad for the Champions League. The spell was a success and a return to United followed.",
      "Louis van Gaal was in charge by then and he provided Varela with a string of appearances, with the right-back making his United senior bow against West Ham in December 2015.",
      "\"I have been pleased with the progress of the younger players when they've been called to train with the first-team squad so I am not afraid of using them if required,\" Van Gaal said.",
      "Just three days later, Varela made his first start for United when playing in a 3-2 defeat to Wolfsburg, a result which sealed the Reds' exit from the Champions League. However, Matteo Darmian was Van Gaal's first-choice right-back and he continued to be selected for the majority of games, which meant Varela had to be patient for starts.",
      "That patience was rewarded in February 2016 when Darmian sustained an injury, which meant Varela started in the second leg of the Europa League Round of 32 against FC Midtjylland. Varela assisted Marcus Rashford in a comfortable 5-1 win and he was one of the best performers that night, which saw him retain his place for the Round of 16 clash against Liverpool.",
      "Liverpool won the first leg 2-0 at Anfield and Varela started again in the reverse fixture, but what happened next essentially ended his time at the club.",
      "Anthony Martial opened the scoring with a penalty in the 32nd minute, but Liverpool equalised just before half-time when Phillipe Coutinho burst down the left and went around Varela.",
      "Coutinho made beating Varela look simple before he dinked the ball over David de Gea and that mistake was enough for Van Gaal to hook him during the interval.",
      "\"It is football,\" Varela later said about his performance and substitution against Liverpool. “Van Gaal gave me the chance to play so I have to say thank you. He is a crazy coach.",
      "\"He was always angry with the players but it was good. I enjoyed it. I played 11 matches. I enjoyed every single one. I played one game in the Champions League, I played in the Europa League. Playing for Manchester United is amazing. Of course, it was a dream.",
      "“Growing up, it was always about Manchester United, ahead of Real Madrid and Barcelona, because of Diego Forlan playing there. So for a player from Uruguay, it was a dream to play for Manchester United. He was my hero.",
      "“But I had to play more. At Manchester United, playing only one or two games a month was not good. I had to play every game and at Manchester United that was difficult.”",
      "Varela featured in a handful of first-team and academy matches during the remainder of that season, so it wasn't a surprise to see him omitted from the 2016 FA Cup final squad.",
      "Van Gaal was sacked after victory against Crystal Palace in that final and Jose Mourinho was named as his successor. The Portuguese took his first pre-season match against Wigan and Varela came on from the bench, but there was no room for him on the subsequent tour of China.",
      "United embarked on their pre-season tour and Varela was sent on loan again, this time to Eintracht Frankfurt. He was now 23 and aware he needed a run of consistent matches. But disaster struck in just Varela's third appearance for Frankfurt when he suffered torn ankle ligaments, which required surgery and a screw inserted into his leg.",
      "Varela returned to action after five months on the sidelines, but he was still struggling with pain caused by the injury, so he underwent further surgery. Although the injury meant he was unavailable for the DFB-Pokal Cup final against Borussia Dortmund, it was suggested his absence was actually due to an infected tattoo.",
      "Varela had received fresh ink during his spell on the sidelines and it allegedly caused inflammation of his arm. Frankfurt reacted by suspending him and ordering his return to Manchester.",
      "\"My name is polluted. I wonder what Real Madrid should do with Sergio Ramos, who is tattooing every week,\" Varela reacted at the time, trying to protest his innocence.",
      "\"I cannot explain why I'm being so severely punished, and I'm not the only Eintracht professional to get a tattoo before the final, but only I was nailed to the cross for going against the manager.",
      "\"Before the 2016 FA Cup final [against Crystal Palace], we went out with several players and got a tattoo, and then we won. Now I wanted to repeat that because it brought us so much luck with Manchester.\"",
      "Frankfurt's sporting director responded: \"The club cannot tolerate that a player would defy instructions. He hurt the team. There was redness around where he had the tattoo, and blisters formed meaning he was unable to train.",
      "\"We'd been thinking about a loan extension. But that won't happen. He'll be suspended with immediate effect.\"",
      "A few years later, Varela attempted to clarify the tattoo situation. “I got a tattoo at the top of my back on my neck,\" he said. \"It was during my injury, while I was not playing, about three months before the final in May.",
      "“[Manager] Niko Kovac said to me, 'I don't want you to get any more tattoos.' I said, 'Why? I'm injured'. He said, 'Yes, I know but you have to respect the players and the staff.'",
      "“I said, 'Okay, I understand but I am injured.' Then when I started to play again I got this one done on my arm [a woman's face].",
      "\"He said to me, 'No, no, no. You stop here because we have the final in one week and I told you before you have to finish with your tattoos so now you are out.' I didn't get infected, that's not true. It was just because I got it.”",
      "Varela returned to Manchester after a disappointing spell with Frankfurt but had no regrets. \"I talked to Jose Mourinho and we talked about my future and what would be best for me,\" he told the Manchester Evening News.",
      "\"He was very sincere towards me. He told me my playing time would be little so my decision was that I preferred to go. A player needs to play and that's what I sought in Frankfurt.\"",
      "Varela was sold by Mourinho in the summer of 2017 and he re-signed for Penarol. \"I really learnt a lot from the way he [Mourinho] trained - the ball was always in the centre of the exercises,\" he said.",
      "\"The relationship was very good and I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I expected his character when he is confronted with the press, but that was definitely not the case.",
      "\"He's always asking how everyone feels, making no difference between Rooney or a player who has just come up. He was always joking and ensuring he had a good connection between everyone and himself.\"",
      "His time at United came to an underwhelming end and, at the time, a source close to the player told the MEN that he returned to his former club for 'personal tranquillity'.",
      "\"The player decided [to join Penarol] after how badly he was treated in Frankfurt. His experience in Europe was not good,\" they said.",
      "Varela left having made 11 first-team appearances for United and he also scored an injury-time winner as the club's Under-21s won the academy Premier League title in 2016.",
      "Many fans were disappointed to see Varela leave the club and he got his career back on track with Penarol before eventually returning to Europe in January 2019.",
      "Varela signed for FC Copenhagen and it was there he admitted he would love a return to Old Trafford in the future. “It would be a dream to go back to Old Trafford. It would be a beautiful moment,\" he said.",
      "\"I wait for this. Maybe we will get drawn to play Manchester United - we don't know. But if we do, it would be a dream. Maybe we will meet again soon. Maybe in the Europa League, maybe in the Premier League.",
      "“I'm still only 26. I of course want to go back to the Premier League at some point. In the future, maybe I can come back and play for Manchester United - I hope.",
      "“I would say thank you to the fans. I want to say thank you for a beautiful four years, thank you for your support.”",
      "Varela was denied his wish of a return to Old Trafford by the pandemic because when United drew Copenhagen in the quarter-finals of the Europa League in 2020, it was a one-off match and played at a neutral venue in Germany. Nonetheless, he started the game and was brought off in extra time.",
      "Varela made over 50 appearances for Copenhagen and played a similar number of games when signing for Dynamo Moscow, but he desired a return to South America.",
      "Since the summer of 2022, Varela has played for Brazilian club Flamengo and represented Uruguay at the Qatar World Cup.",
      "He has finally found his 'personal tranquillity' at 30 years old.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is starting to turn his potential into performances for Man Utd but Erik ten Hag needs him to stay fit for the rest of the season.",
      "For the second successive transfer window, Manchester United are rolling the dice when it comes to the players responsible for putting the ball in the back of the net. Buoyed by a return of eight goals in two games this week, Erik ten Hag might hope his luck is beginning to turn, but suddenly the status of the revival at Old Trafford is contingent on the fitness of Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "The 20-year-old was the £72million summer signing asked to lead the line before he was ready. United gambled on a talented centre-forward who had scored nine goals in one season in Serie A and was moving clubs for the third time in 18 months.",
      "In an ideal world, Ten Hag wanted two strikers last summer. He was taken by Hojlund's talent and character, but he was inexperienced at the highest level, having progressed rapidly from FC Copenhagen to Sturm Graz, then to Atalanta and then United. He was still learning his trade but the elite-level centre-forward was out of United's price range. Hojlund was the future and the here and now.",
      "In hindsight, maybe the £55m spent on Mason Mount might have gone towards an attempt to sign Harry Kane. Mount has had an injury-hit first season at the club and the emergence of Kobbie Mainoo has added competition in central areas.",
      "That is something Hojlund has never faced. Anthony Martial has been disappointing when he has played and is now out for another two months or so with a groin injury. The Frenchman has managed just 635 minutes all season and hasn't kicked a ball since December 9.",
      "At least an inconsistent Martial offered some back-up to Hojlund. Now, even that isn't available. Having wanted a more experienced striker as well in the summer, Ten Hag wanted almost any kind of striker in January, but the limits of financial fair play meant he couldn't bring anyone in, not even another Wout Weghorst-style loan.",
      "That puts pressure on Hojlund to stay fit. He has started eight of the last nine games and is likely to be asked to start the remaining 16 Premier League games, as well as a potential four FA Cup matches. The fact United only have a maximum of 20 games left this season helps Ten Hag. There will be maybe three or four midweek matches, at most, still to come and rotation won't be necessary, but he still needs to keep Hojlund fit and firing.",
      "Without Martial, Marcus Rashford is the only real alternative through the middle, but he is starting to find form from the left again. Ten Hag needs Hojlund available, especially now the Dane is finding his feet. He scored in a third successive Premier League game in the win at Wolves.",
      "That hot streak in front of goal is the first consistent sign that the summer gamble on Hojlund is going to pay off. It took him until late in his 15th Premier League game to finally score a domestic goal, but if they have floodgates in Denmark, they have just opened for Hojlund.",
      "Even amidst his drought, the youngster was never the most pressing issue in what has been a dysfunctional team for much of the season, but it was fair to ask if a more experienced striker would have helped United to chisel out more points. The pressure on Hojlund was ramped up because he was the focal point for goals in a struggling team.",
      "Now he is showing the talent seen in flashes before Christmas on a more regular basis and his partnership with Rashford, in particular, is beginning to flourish. Ten Hag had banked on his team looking more like their old selves when key players returned and at Molineux there was enough to suggest he might be right.",
      "He has had chronic injury issues to deal with this season, but the treatment room is emptying out. If his luck is beginning to turn, then Hojlund will remain fit for the rest of the season. If he doesn't, then that would be a real problem now.",

      "Hamilton will join Ferrari at the end of the 2024 season after 11 years with Mercedes. The English driver won six of his seven championships with the team and will now partner Charles Leclerc in 2025.",

Mainoo, now 18, has become a mainstay in the United team since he recovered from a four-month lay-off with an ankle injury in November and he has started in nine of United's last 13 games.",
      "\"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag said. \"I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable. I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",

      "The victory means United have now won more games than they have lost this season but the failure to win by a bigger margin still nagged Ten Hag despite the jubilant scenes at full-time. \"To be honest, I had mixed feelings,\" he said.",
      "\"One side: very pleased. Of course, it's a massive win, this. I think for a neutral fan, spectator of this game, it was great to see but as a manager, when you see you dominate a game for an hour, you should go three or 4-0 by the hour, because we had the chances and we conceded nothing.",
      "\"But then the way we concede the goals we should manage that better on the pitch, this can't happen. But then you see the spirit of the team and the resilience and especially in Kobbie Mainoo, that is great to see.",

      "Paul Gascoigne has sent a message of support to Marcus Rashford after his well-publicised trip to Belfast, but warned the Manchester United star not to go down the same road as him",
      "Football legend Paul Gascoigne has sent a heartfelt message to Manchester United star Marcus Rashford, saying: \"don't make the same mistakes as me\".",
      "After Rashford's recent trip to Belfast, which cost him a fine of around £650,000, Gascoigne offered his support and advice. The former England star told the Mirror: \"I really like Marcus Rashford. He is my favourite England player. But you can tell things are just not right for him right now.",
      "\"I would say to him, 'Don't make the same mistakes as me.' He may need the help of the players around him, the staff to bring him around. Sometimes there are problems outside the game. He is a great player, at a great club, playing for his country, and yet he doesn't seem happy. Obviously there is an issue with the manager and he doesn't even celebrate his goals in the same way. He is down, he is getting fined, like I was at Lazio, it is not easy being in the limelight.",
      "\"When I was at Spurs, I found it so hard that I went to see a counsellor once a week, to talk my problems through. As a man, it is sometimes hard to ask for help. Even footballers need it sometimes. Marcus is earning a fortune, at one of the biggest clubs in the world, everyone thinks you do not have a care in the world. But the pressure is not always easy.\"",
      "Gazza was fined £40,000 at Lazio in Italy after taking his family to Eurodisney when he was due to train. He said: \"I bounced back, and that is what Marcus has to do. What I have learned is, always think about the repercussions of your actions. If you are going to do something, like clubbing, I would say to Marcus, 'Stop and think, 'What if this comes out?'",
      "\"Because in the morning, everyone will know where you were. It happens when you are that famous. When I saw where Marcus was, in Belfast, I thought, 'Last time I was out drinking like that, I ended up in rehab.'",
      "Rashford, who scored for United in last night's win against Wolves, spoke with manager Erik ten Hag at Carrington about his recent behaviour. The club later stated: \"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions. This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed.\"",
      "However, ten Hag emphasised that being part of a top club like United requires \"a certain way of life\". He said: \"The player has to know what is good and not good. I don't have to educate them anymore. When you are playing for Manchester United, they should know.\"",
      "Gazza shared how some of his managers helped him tackle his own issues. Speaking about Rashford's situation, he said: \"I don't think it would have happened under Sir Alex Ferguson. It is impossible following in his footsteps. But sometimes you need an arm around the shoulder. You play for managers you love because you want to do well for them. I loved Terry Venables and Sir Bobby Robson.",
      "\"I was very emotional when I heard Terry had died, he was such a great manager, so good to me when I was young. He would encourage me when I was down, say I was brilliant when I had not played well. Sometimes you need that.\" Gazza also talked about his regular counselling sessions in London, saying: \"It gets things off your chest.",
      "\"It is completely confidential. I struggled at Spurs, I cost £2.2million which was big money then. I would get an electricity bill and wonder what to do with it. I got the neighbour in all the time to sort out things in the house. But counselling helped me cope with some of my issues when I was around Marcus' age.\"",
      "The ex-midfielder suggested Rashford, well-known for his campaigning for free school meals and support for less fortunate families, try to \"play with a smile on his face\", something Gazza did himself.",
      "He advised: \"The houses, jewellery, fast cars, they are all thanks to supporters. They pay so much money to go to games. When you are playing, especially for England, always remember the fans. They are the most important part of the game, you have to entertain them, win them over, never forget them.",
      "\"He can do that. And that was the one thing that I always wanted to do. I hope Marcus can enjoy himself again and get back to the top of his game. He has so much to look forward to at the Euros this summer. He is still a great player, he can bounce back.\"",
      "Gazza, renowned for winning 57 caps for England, mentioned how after performing at the Italia 90 World Cup he became so famous it \"felt like Beatlemania\" once he returned home.",
      "He shared: \"My mum wore a sign saying, 'Don't disturb me' at the bingo. I had to leg it out the back door sometimes, there were so many people outside the house.\" He's famous for some brilliant goals, especially the one against Scotland in Euro 96 when he flicked the ball over Colin Hendry and scored.",
      "That led to the famous \"dentist chair\" celebration, with his teammates squirting water into his mouth as he lay on the pitch, just like their earlier fun night out."

Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",
      "That was also a Saturday 12.30pm kick-off.",

It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

      "Man Utd showed character to hold on and get a good point away at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon.",
      "If you can't win a game, then it is imperative that you don't lose. The biggest compliment you pay Manchester United is that they actually did that yesterday.",
      "Liverpool's 7-0 thrashing earlier in the year was still very much fresh in the memory and much of the talk ahead of the match was about how many the home side would win by rather than if they would at all.",
      "United have been hammered for the pathetic nature of some of their defeats this season, particularly against Newcastle and Bournemouth in recent weeks, and the lack of character shown on such occasions, but this time they just did enough.",
      "This is a United side that is still relying on moments to have any joy against the very best sides and in the biggest moments at Anfield, they somehow found a way for them to turn their way.",
      "United have been guilty of overcomplicating things under Ten Hag and trying to run before they can walk, but this was a case of keeping things simple so that they had the foundations in place to possibly nick a positive result.",
      "It was always going to rely on a little bit of luck at the back to withstand the Liverpool bombardment and a bit of brilliance in attack for United to make the most of their infrequent forays into the opposition half. They worked for their luck, but once again their lack of experience in the forward line was glaring.",
      "Liverpool were always going to be on top, so there was little surprise to see United adopt a defensive approach to counter it. Yet, no matter how ugly and unorthodox it was at times, they stubbornly survived with a show of real willingness and determination.",
      "United were never going to beat Jurgen Klopp's side at their own game but they would always stand a chance if they dug deep, frustrated the home side and played the seasonal role of pantomime villains.",
      "Andre Onana hesitated over every goalkick until the last possible nanosecond and Antony riled the home crowd with his fiery contest against Konstantinos Tsimikas. Just as important, though, was the experience of Raphael Varane and Jonny Evans at the heart of the United defence. They are the ninth different centre-back pairing used already this season, and between them, they have seen it all.",
      "They dug deep with their defensive work and organised backline. They used every trick in the book to ruin the rhythm of the match and disrupt Liverpool from bombarding the goal in the same manner they had started the match.",
      "But even on the rare occasions United penetrated the Liverpool backline, they lacked the composure and clinical finishing required to make the home side pay. Alejandro Garnacho took a poor touch, Rasmus Hojlund fired at Alisson Becker and Scott McTominay launched a speculative shot well wide of goal.",
      "On another day, one of those chances might have gone in and they would have won the game. Liverpool could say exactly the same about the opportunities they somehow squandered.",
      "That in itself is the ultimate compliment you can pay this United team. It wasn't a memorable match, but it was a memorable performance for the way they dug deep and almost nicked the match themselves.",
      "So perhaps a draw was a fair result. Liverpool dominated but there were plenty of false dawns and for all the pressure they applied to the United goal, they still struggled to carve out any clear-cut chances to score.",
      "It is a credit to United that Liverpool fans were the ones leaving Anfield annoyed. Now that is a shock.",

      "Man Utd produced their best performance of the season in beating Everton with a team that looked familiar to previous eras.",
      "It was Manchester United's best away win under Erik ten Hag but came with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Squint a little and there was more than the faint outline of an Ole Gunnar Solskjaer team in action in red at Goodison Park.",
      "There were Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire propelling everything thrown at them at centre-back. Scott McTominay was holding the midfield together and Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial combined in attack. There was a new man in the dugout and a new goalkeeper, but plenty of familiarity aside from that.",
      "To give credit to Ten Hag, he has overseen the development and promotion of Kobbie Mainoo and taken Alejandro Garnacho to the next level, but his stamp on the team has become less evident as he has gone back to basics this season. After a shaky start to the season, that approach has worked with five wins out of six in the Premier League.",
      "The 3-0 win at Everton on Sunday was the best win of the season, as well as the first statement away win of the Ten Hag era, but it came without a single Ten Hag signing starting outfield, although Andre Onana was excellent in goal. This might be close to United's best team at the moment, but it almost certainly isn't the team that their manager wants to pick.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay could have left this summer, while Mason Mount was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw in midfield. Ten Hag wanted his team to become more dominant in their play, but it unravelled early in the season and although injuries haven't helped, he has been forced to retreat from that ideal to get results on the board.",
      "The question now is how he goes back to moving the team on. The win at Everton was gritty and determined, but you could argue it wasn't a team playing in the image of its manager, although injuries remain a major issue for Ten Hag.",
      "When everyone is fit again, he might look to restore some of his signings to the team, but right now it's arguable only two more would get in alongside Onana, who after a nervous spell in goal is beginning to look like a very good signing.",
      "If we include Sofyan Amrabat, on whom United have an option to make the move permanent, Ten Hag has signed 11 players across his three transfer windows, at a cost of more than £400million. Some were signed to play bit-part roles, such as backup goalkeeper Altay Bayindir and free agent Jonny Evans.",
      "Maybe the same could be said for Tyrell Malacia, who is on the comeback trail after a serious knee injury, but there was an expectation he would challenge the excellent Luke Shaw and that hasn't happened. Shaw is comfortably the better player.",
      "In the centre of defence, Lisandro Martinez would get back in this team, ahead of Lindelof and alongside Maguire, but the picture in midfield is complicated. Bruno Fernandes is undroppable and Mainoo's outstanding performance at Everton has put him in the frame for more appearances, with Scott McTominay now starting seven of the last eight games in all competitions, only missing the Carabao Cup defeat to Newcastle.",
      "McTominay and Mainoo are starting ahead of Amrabat at the moment, with the Fiorentina loanee failing to make an impression on the team so far. Christian Eriksen had been showing some form of late, but Mount has had a difficult start to life at Old Trafford and his route back into the team looks complicated given the emergence of Mainoo.",
      "In attack, Rasmus Hojlund will return to take the place of Martial, despite the latter's goal at Goodison Park, but Antony will surely remain on the periphery even when fit. The £85million winger has never looked like living up to that price tag and his influence on games has been minimal this season.",
      "Ten Hag said a couple of weeks ago that Rashford would stay in the team despite his struggles for form, so having finally netted his second goal of the season his place is secure. Garnacho has also been playing well of late and after his majestic overhead kick on Sunday, there is no way he can be dropped at the moment.",
      "So at the moment, if everyone was fit, it might only be Martinez and Hojlund that join Onana in that team. If Bayindir and Evans were signed to be reserves and you can make a case that Malacia and Eriksen were also deals to add strength to the team, it still leaves Casemiro, Mount, Amrabat and Antony on the outside.",
      "The majority of these players would be in the team that Ten Hag wants to build at United. But for now, the approach to getting results might be leaving some of them out of favour.",

      "\"When they're on the pitch, we don't know which is which\" was a chant incepted for the Da Silva twins and it could soon be allocated to the Fletchers.",
      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",
      "Tyler played in an Under-17 European Championship qualifier for Scotland against Belarus in October and the next month Jack was in the England line-up for their qualifying win against Croatia.",
      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",
      "Tyler posed for his intimate unveiling photo, clutching a shirt with 'Fletcher 6', in the Old Trafford boardroom in August. In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008. Peer closer and Darren is visible in the background on the passenger boarding steps.",

      "Man United youngster Dan Gore has made excellent progress over the last 18 months, so the MEN spoke to two of his former coaches at Burnley to discuss his journey to the first-team at Old Trafford.",
      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Borussia Dortmund's sporting director Sebastian Kehl has explained why it would be hard to strike a deal with Manchester United for Jadon Sancho",
      "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has conceded it's unlikely Jadon Sancho will sign for the club permanently - even if Manchester United look to offload the forward in the summer.",
      "The 23-year-old, who spent four years at Dortmund after signing from Manchester City in 2017, returned to the club last month on a loan deal until the end of the season. His return to the Bundesliga from Old Trafford came after a public falling out with manager Erik ten Hag back in September.",
      "Since returning to the Signal Iduna Park, Sancho has provided two assists in three Bundesliga games and helped Edin Terzic's side kick-start their pursuit of Champions League qualification with three consecutive league wins.",
      "However, Kehl has all-but-ruled out Sancho making his return to Dortmund permanent, insisting that the price United would demand for the forward would make any future deal \"very, very difficult.\"",
      "Speaking to Sky Sports Germany, Kehl said: \"Unfortunately for both players [Ian Maatsen and Jadon Sancho], neither option was really realistic. If you know what we got for Jadon Sancho two and a half years ago, then you know also that it might now be very, very difficult.",
      "\"We naturally advocated for an option with him - and also with Ian - but the negotiating position was not such that we could implement it and so we will accept it for now.\"",
      "It remains to be seen if Sancho, whose deal at Old Trafford runs until 2026, will ever play for United under Ten Hag again.",

Casemiro also made way in the second half on his first league start since October 7 but Ten Hag clarified that was a precaution as he had been yellow-carded in the third minute and conceded a penalty that Pablo Sarabia converted on 71 minutes.",

But also I think for Licha, he was of course a long way out and we brought Harry Maguire on as an extra header and Omari (Forson) for Rasmus.",
      "\"Also, [Casemiro] has to catch up as well, Case. I know the more games he plays, the better he will be. But he needs some game minutes, that’s what he takes the most benefit from.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is one of the success stories of the Premier League season and he only made his first start in November.",
      "Revisiting one's first assessment of Kobbie Mainoo in an FA Youth Cup semi-final offers reassurance. Dated March 9 2022, the sentence reads: \"Kobbie Mainoo, in midfield, was exceptional.\"",
      "Mainoo's first Premier League goal 694 days later was also exceptional. Even as it dawned on him that he had clipped in a 97th-minute winner and faced with the sight of grown men and women clambering over each other in the tiered moshpit of the Steve Bull Stand, Mainoo celebrated as calmly as he had scored. He spread his arms with the nonchalance of a rock star at the conclusion of an encore.",
      "By the time he had finished his first on-pitch televised interview, almost every Manchester United supporter had vacated their gold-coloured seat. Mainoo is their golden boy.",
      "FROM 2022: Impressing Ten Hag and Ronaldo - Mainoo set for his next breakthrough at United",
      "FROM 2023: Same parking spot and living at home - how Kobbie Mainoo is keeping his feet on the ground at United",
      "The premium pro of Erik ten Hag's tenure is he has bestowed United two academy legacies, turning the boys Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho into men. Garnacho, too, registered a first league goal in added time in front of an away end last season.",
      "Garnacho hoisted his shirt to brandish his name and number to those in the Putney End at Fulham. Mainoo exercised a different variety of audacity: shifting past one Wolves defender, nutmegging another, bypassing a third before arching the ball beyond the goalkeeper's palm.",
      "You'll have replayed it already but have another look. When Mainoo veers inside, Bruno Fernandes is practically demanding he pass the ball. Fernandes, the outfield player farthest away, sprints to join the throng.",
      "Fernandes has been especially welcoming amid Mainoo's integration into the first-team squad. Jonny Evans is another teammate who has offered invaluable advice. Evans, twice the age of Mainoo, grinned as broadly as a proud father when he grabbed Mainoo at Molineux.",
      "United players' appreciation of Mainoo is palpable. Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw all congratulated him on his full Premier League debut at Everton in November and more teammates queued up to compliment Mainoo on his game management at Wolves.",
      "The engaging Rasmus Hojlund stopped in the mixed zone and the first two questions were on Mainoo. Hojlund jumped onto the pitch and into Maguire's arms with the ball rolling around the net. He had Mainoo in a clinch at full-time.",
      "Umpteen column inches have already been dedicated to Mainoo by this newspaper and we hope that will continue well beyond this decade. He is a potential long-term linchpin for United.",
      "Ten Hag named Mainoo on the bench in his 13th match as manager. He took him to the winter training camp in Cadiz during the World Cup, there was a debut last January and Mainoo would have been a first-teamer sooner had he not been collateral damage in Casemiro's foul on the Real Madrid winger Rodrygo in July.",
      "Any aspiring academy graduate intending to walk past Carrington's fountain of youth, with the 249 names who have appeared for the first team glazed onto a glass display, need only look at Mainoo's development. It is the new blueprint.",
      "It was more like the Ten Hag of last season at Wolves and that extended to his post-match press conference. He had \"mixed feelings\" that United had not won as handsomely as they should have. He revealed his hot-housing of Mainoo started with haste.",
      "\"I think very quickly I saw him,\" Ten Hag recalled. \"I think last autumn (of 2022) I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable in the under-21s, he should be much more dominant.",
      "\"We pushed him a lot by that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "England will inevitably come calling. Beyond the generational talents of Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice, there is a dearth of inspiring out-and-out central midfielders in the national team squad and Mainoo's form is impossible to ignore. Would anyone objectively prefer Conor Gallagher or Jordan Henderson to Mainoo?",
      "United supporters will understandably hope he remains out of Gareth Southgate's clutches until at least after the European Championship. If Southgate was loyal to his maxim that players are picked on form then Mainoo would be a shoo-in for the Euros.",
      "Mainoo has fewer games for United than his 18 years but consider the tests he has passed: the bear pit of Goodison, the lion's den at Galatasaray and United's old graveyard at Anfield. In the one game he memorably erred at West Ham, his performance is still remembered for the accomplished 77 minutes that preceded his miscontrol.",
      "The anguish etched on Mainoo's face that afternoon in London was almost as endearing as his cheerleading at Anfield six days earlier. In an age where footballers appear more detached from matchgoers than ever, Mainoo represents the United fan on the pitch.",
      "Mainoo is so integral his tactical removal during the interval at Nottingham Forest consigned United to defeat. Ten Hag insisted he had \"no regrets\" about that. Mainoo has started all four games since and has not been hooked in any of them.",
      "So already it is a question of which midfielder starts with Mainoo, rather than does Mainoo start. In the Tombola selection of midfield pairings, last week at Newport was the first time Ten Hag was able to select Mainoo and Casemiro since pre-season.",
      "It is not a coincidence Mainoo has gone from guard to goal-getter with Casemiro the sentry. United will require a central midfielder in the summer and should tailor their recruitment in that area around Mainoo's skill set.",
      "For he is exceptional.",

      "However, at Manchester United, an expectation has emerged regarding the importance of giving youth a chance. Throughout history, some of the Reds' best squads have had a youthful core propelling them to glory.",

      "\"Developing players into the first team should be one key area of Manchester United because this club is very successful with it and we are now bringing up players. It is a big advantage that young players always have a very good connection with the fans and it gives a club identity.\"",
      "This assurance of a pathway from the reserves to the first team is often easier said than done but one key statistic proves the Reds' boss is keeping to his promise. Mainoo's stunning winner on Thursday night at Molineux is only the second time in Premier League history a goal has been scored and assisted by teenagers - Omari Forson was credited with setting up the midfielder in the West Midlands.",
      "The only previous example of this came at Anfield as a young Cristiano Ronaldo provided Wayne Rooney with a goal in 2005. Ten Hag may have had his fair share of deserved criticism this season with results being below par.",
      "But, should the new regime decide to fire the Dutchman at the end of the season, he shall at least leave behind a legacy of reintegrating the academy back into the club. While results may be bleak and the table not making for good reading, the emergence of Garnacho, Mainoo and now Forson shows there is light at the end of the tunnel for the Reds. It's in the club's DNA, after all.",

      "When it comes to the task of selecting his starting line-up for Sunday's clash with West Ham United, Erik ten Hag ought not to encounter too many difficulties.",
      "Thursday night's 4-3 win over Wolves felt as though it could prove to be a significant juncture in Manchester United's season. After throwing away a lead in stoppage time, Kobbie Mainoo spared United's blushes with a moment of individual brilliance.",
      "In an arena that features golden seats, United's golden boy injected fresh energy into their season, finding the back of the net with a goal that will be spoken about for years to come. Though the 4-3 scoreline suggested United had edged an even contest, it was anything but.",
      "United, particularly in the first half, produced their most polished performance of the season. Some may go as far as saying the football on show in the first 45 minutes was the best they have produced under Ten Hag.",
      "Though it featured a familiar flaw in the form of missed chances, United's first-half showing in the Black Country, which saw them head into the half-time interval with a two-goal lead, was superb. Featuring a clear identity, energy and hunger, United, with more composure, would have been home and dry.",
      "Lisandro Martinez added organisation and his ball-playing credentials to the back-four. Luke Shaw added an extra attacking threat from left-back. Marcus Rashford, recalled after a disciplinary issue, caused havoc down the left. Rasmus Hojlund led the line with maturity. Mainoo, as ever, oozed class in midfield.",
      "Everything that could have gone right in the first half did go right. Defensive flaws crept in after the break, particularly in the manner in which United conceded for a third time, but everything else was on point.",
      "Ten Hag had quipped for several weeks that he expected United to get back to their best once their injury crisis had eased and the likes of Martinez, Shaw and Casemiro returned. He was within his rights to stand by that argument based on Thursday night's evidence.",
      "Of course, the challenge for United now is to prove that Thursday night's showing was not a flash in the pan. False dawns have been a far too familiar theme this season. They must prove that the performance they produced at Molineux can be replicated week after week.",
      "For many, United now have the ingredients available to them to find some much-needed consistency, following the returns of the likes of Martinez and Shaw, who are both critical to the way Ten Hag wants his team to play. With those two available, the Dutchman now has a crop of players available to him that help form the strongest XI currently at the club.",
      "The XI Ten Hag deployed at Molineux is United's strongest currently. It featured a goalkeeper of Ten Hag's choice, a ball-playing centre-back, a midfielder with enormous potential, one of the most accomplished attacking midfielders in the world, an exciting winger and a £72million striker.",
      "This forthcoming summer will mark the next stage of Ten Hag's gradual rebuild, meaning further additions are expected. With INEOS overseeing recruitment, it is hoped that United will be wise in their thinking and not repeat any mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "It is understood that United have provisionally drawn up a list of four positions they wish to strengthen next season: right-back, centre-back, central-midfield and up front. Of the XI that started at Molineux, you can argue upgrades, for the long-term, are needed at right-back, centre-back and in defensive-midfield.",
      "Diogo Dalot has frequently contested the right-back spot with Aaron Wan-Bissaka over the past 12 months, with Ten Hag failing to settle on a first-choice option. Raphael Varane's fitness is unreliable, meaning United need to source a long-term partner for Martinez. Casemiro turns 32 later this month and is, it is felt, past his peak.",
      "Should Ten Hag receive strong financial backing from Sir Jim Ratcliffe, finding a new right-back, a centre-back and a replacement for Casemiro should be United's three main objectives this summer. They must also find someone to provide competition and back-up for Hojlund.",
      "Those three starting positions aside, United have a cluster of players capable of taking the club forward. The left-wing may come under scrutiny, too, but it shouldn't if Rashford performs at his best consistently.",
      "United will, of course, need to add strength in depth this summer, certainly within reason, but three statement signings to go into the first XI could be enough. It is now down to United's existing players to prove it.",

      "Hannibal enjoyed a mini-breakthrough in the first-team but was unable to nail down a regular starting place in the following weeks and that led to his departure. Sevilla have signed Hannibal on a loan for the remainder of the season with the option to make the deal permanent, which means he could have played his last game for United.",
      "Hannibal's departure after breaking into the first-team and being lavished with praise by his manager shows how difficult it is for youngsters to bridge the gap to the senior squad. The demands are high - particularly each day in training - and only the best prospects from the academy are kept around the squad, like Alejandro Garnacho and Thursday night's hero Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Other players are sent on loan to accelerate their development, but this window has also seen the departure of several youngsters on permanent deals. Mateo Mejia joined Sevilla earlier in the window and Isak Hansen-Aarøen signed for Werder Bremen on transfer deadline day. The latter was well-regarded by coaches and many supporters were hoping he would extend his stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Hansen-Aarøen, 19, was out of contract in the summer and sources indicated he was offered a 'significant' new deal. But it's understood the player was frustrated over his lack of opportunities and felt a permanent move away was the best option for his career. He was overlooked in FA Cup matches against Wigan Athletic and Newport County when his peers were given minutes, which contributed to his decision to leave.",
      "There were high hopes for Hansen-Aarøen when he arrived in Manchester from Tromsø in August 2020. He was considered one of Norway's most exciting talents.",
      "Those familiar with Norwegian football suggested that Hansen-Aarøen was a better prospect than Manchester City's Oscar Bobb when he initially made the switch to England, but one player's progress stalled at Old Trafford while the other's has blossomed at the Etihad. It was inevitable that Hansen-Aarøen would look at his friend Bobb's progress and question his situation at United, wondering why Ten Hag wasn't giving him opportunities.",
      "Hansen-Aarøen has left the club without making a debut and there's a feeling of what could have been, so it will be fascinating to see how he develops in the Bundesliga. There is emerging and senior talent in his position at United and Werder Bremen should give him the opportunities he's been desperate for after multiple seasons of academy football.",
      "Regarding the deal itself, sources have indicated the sale has secured United a better package than the expected compensation fee that would have been received if Hansen-Aarøen left when his contract expired. Werder Bremen have paid a fee and the terms inserted in the deal by United have been described as favourable.",
      "It's understood the deal includes add-ons, a high percentage sell-on clause and future matching rights for prospective buyers down the line. Hansen-Aarøen wanted to leave this month and United believe they have negotiated a good deal in the circumstances.",

United thought better of it before seeking a loan repeat this time around despite the clear need for reinforcements.",

      "Latest Manchester United transfer news and gossip as four-time Premier League title winner Anderson has criticised the club's recent transfer business and the effect it's had on the pitch",
      "Former Manchester United star Anderson has slammed his old club's business in the transfer market in recent years.",
      "Anderson made 181 appearances for United from 2007-15, scoring nine goals from midfield. The 35-year-old was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson from Porto and went on to win four Premier League titles while at Old Trafford.",
      "It has been nearly a decade since Anderson left the club to return to Brazil. Now the former midfielder, who retired in 2019, has weighed in on United's current situation under manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Anderson has criticised United's business in the transfer market, in particular overspending on certain deals. While not naming any players specifically, Anderson has explained why he thinks his former club could have been more shrewd in the market with some of the signings that have been made.",
      "“Nowadays, small clubs go to play at Old Trafford, and are not afraid,\" Anderson said in an interview with Globo Esporte. \"Today, the club doesn’t know which manager it will have, who controls it. It’s a mess. Manchester United sometimes buy very badly. If you’re going to pay €100 million (£85 million) for a player, pay for Neymar.",
      "“A player who will make a difference. Manchester United pay €70m, €80m , €90m for players who have no logic. I think the club’s desperation is so great that anyone will do.”",
      "United have signed 10 players on permanent deals since Ten Hag was appointed back in 2022. More than £400 million has been spent across the last two summer transfer windows alone, with Mason Mount, Lisandro Martinez, Casemiro, Antony, Christian Eriksen, Tyrell Malacia, Andre Onana, Ramsus Hojlund, Altay Bayindir and Jonny Evans all arriving on a permanent basis since Ten Hag was hired.",
      "After finishing third in the Premier League and winning the Carabao Cup last season, this campaign has been more of a struggle for United and Ten Hag. The club went into their away game at Wolves in ninth place in the table and 11 points adrift of the top four spots with a game in hand.",

      "Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri and Jadon Sancho were among 11 departures in the January transfer window and Man United could still yet sell more players.",
      "The clock struck 11pm on Thursday night with not so much as a bang but a whimper. Manchester United and their Premier League rivals were particularly quiet during the January transfer window for 2024.",
      "Owing to lingering FFP caution - coupled with a significant £180million spend last summer - United were always expected to focus on outgoings last month. That proved to be the case into the final knockings despite finalised investment from Sir Jim Ratcliffe as INEOS Group continue to await Premier League ratification.",
      "As things played out, there was not enough wiggle room in the budget for United to add to their options in the push for a top-four finish. However, true to plan, they were able to rubber-stamp quite a few departures such as Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri and the ousted Jadon Sancho.",
      "Those three - and others - departed Old Trafford on loan. A permanent exit was also sealed with Bundesliga side Werder Bremen paying an undisclosed fee to snap up Isak Hansen-Aaroen.",
      "The highly-rated youngster was allowed to leave owing to concerns over his long-term future. The playmaker was into the final six months of his contract with no sign of an extension being agreed.",
      "By the time the window slammed shut on Thursday night, United had sanctioned 12 departures and they could in theory add to their exodus before next summer rolls around. That's because there are still one or two markets still open for business despite the widespread European cut-off on February 1.",
      "Clubs in Portugal have until Friday night (February 2) to conclude their business, while there is a little while longer still to go in Austria (February 6) and Turkey (February 9). The latter is a particularly interesting option for United as they sold Brazil international Fred to Fenerbahce for £12.9million last summer.",
      "Aside from van de Beek and Sancho - who moved away on loan - United were open to selling three other senior players during the January window. However, the club also emphasised that they did not intend to force Raphael Varane, Casemiro or Anthony Martial out.",
      "Varane and Casemiro have returned to the starting XI in recent weeks. Martial, meanwhile, is struggling with a hip injury and is expected to depart United next summer.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo netted a 97th-minute winner after Pedro Neto had seemingly earned a point for the home side, who had fought back from 3-1 down. United led 2-0 at half-time after goals from Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Pablo Sarabia netted a controversial penalty with just under 20 minutes remaining to halve the deficit but United restored their two-goal advantage through Scott McTominay. Max Kilman then struck before Neto drew the home side level.",
      "Mainoo then produced a moment of magic to secure a vital three points for the Reds and lift them up to seventh in the table. With the race for European football for next season now looking even tighter, MEN Sport has had a look at United's next six league fixtures and compared them with those of their immediate rivals.",
      "Verdict: United's upcoming crop of fixtures feature a mixed bag of assignments. The trip to the Etihad Stadium for the Manchester derby on March 3 is by far the most daunting, but the clashes with the likes of Fulham and Everton at home resemble good opportunities for points.",
      "The trips to Aston Villa and Luton Town will be difficult tests for different reasons, and West Ham cannot be underestimated at Old Trafford this coming weekend. But if United are to bridge the gap to the top four, they need to be taking somewhere in the region of 12 to 15 points from the next 18 on offer.",

      "Man Utd focused on player exits in the January transfer window rather than signing new players",
      "Manchester United insist they have the privilege of developing young players as opposed to the pressure of doing so. There is no other club scrutinised at the academy level quite like them.",
      "That is a by-product of the success it has brought them, coupled with the fact that they are very happy to draw attention to it themselves.",
      "Last month, they held their annual academy event at Old Trafford to celebrate their illustrious academy in a year when it is likely they will reach the milestone of having seen 250 homegrown players make their competitive debut. Head of the Academy, Nick Cox, said he was genuinely intrigued by who that might be. Well, it won't be Isak Hansen-Aarøen anyway.",
      "The Norwegian youngster became the latest player to leave the club on loan or a permanent deal in the January transfer window when he sealed a permanent transfer to Werder Bremen. It was a sale that left many supporters disappointed, though from the club's point of view, it made sense rather than risk losing him for free in the summer instead.",
      "The Manchester Evening News revealed earlier this week that United still wanted the teenager to sign a new long-term deal at the club but were open to a sale when it became abundantly clear he would not be signing it.",
      "Hansen-Aarøen felt undervalued by the club and didn't see a clear pathway for him into the first team. He wanted to be playing regularly and to progress with his professional career, though some at the club believe he was unrealistic about what he expected at such a young age.",
      "The harsh truth is that while he wielded dreams of making it at United and they still felt he had huge potential, he wasn't in a position to fulfil it just yet. It's another example of a transfer policy change since Erik ten Hag arrived.",
      "Ten Hag has taken on a more hands-on approach with the academy since he joined the club, having felt the U21s were 'isolated' before his arrival. He now takes an active role in deciding which youngsters train with the first team and has set the challenge for at least one youth team player to become part of the first team during every season he's at the club.",
      "A key reason why he was appointed was because of his track record of nurturing youth talent and he has helped to raise those standards during his time at the club.",
      "Ten Hag won't give youngsters an opportunity just to keep up traditions and he has made it clear that only the very best youth prospects will be given a chance in the senior set-up.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo have been given those chances, while others have been moved on given the slim likelihood of them ever making it at the club.",
      "As well as the sale of Hansen-Aarøen, Hannibal Mejbri moved to Sevilla on an initial loan with the option of a permanent sale and Alvaro Fernandez left in a similar deal to join Benfica. In total, United loaned out nine players in the window just gone, while Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado were all allowed to leave last summer.",
      "United have aimed to become \"smarter\" in terms of selling academy graduates and they have also become a lot more ruthless, with staff suspecting players are going \"stale and sour\" if they stay at the club too long without getting an opportunity to play. That was proven this week.",
      "Then there is the financial side of it all. \"Every football club has an academy to try to produce young players to go and play for the first team,\" Cox told The Manchester Evening News. \"That's originally why Manchester United had an academy, because it was the best way of creating a team from an economic point of view.\"",
      "Now it is economic to view the academy as a money-making machine as well. The current Financial Fair Play rules mean it is hugely beneficial to a club to sell homegrown players because the profit on the sale is purely classified as income.",
      "So while there might be dismay at the number of youngsters currently leaving the club, it could well be a masterstroke that frees up finances elsewhere and lands them a sizeable windfall from a sell-on clause in the years to come.",
      "The youngsters leaving United do so with a point to prove. It would benefit United if they proved it as well.",
      "It's the January transfer window once again, but despite United's indifferent start to the season, it remains to be seen whether they'll be able to bring any new players to Old Trafford this month. While the emphasis this January is on outgoings, with several players set to be sold or loaned out, there remains a possibility of a loan signing or two before February arrives.",

      "United delivered their best first-half performance of the season at Molineux and they had a two-goal lead by the interval thanks to goals from Marcus Rashford and Hojlund. But, despite creating plenty of chances, a third proved elusive and Wolves halved the deficit with 20 minutes remaining.",
      "Casemiro brought down Neto in the box and VAR stuck with the referee's decision. Wolves converted from the spot and Ten Hag introduced Scott McTominay to the game. McTominay made an immediate impact when scoring from a corner and the result looked to be wrapped up, but Wolves mounted a dramatic comeback and made it 3-3 in added time.",
      "The points looked set to be shared until United responded at the other end through Mainoo, who did brilliantly to find the bottom right corner. Mainoo, who was the breakout star of the pre-season tour of the USA, has been exceptional this season and Hojlund lauded him when speaking to TNT Sport after the final whistle.",
      "\"I know I'm not allowed to swear, but I was thinking 's***, s****' [when Wolves equalised] but it's a great goal. We need to sort them situations out and I was fuming on the bench of course,\" Hojlund said.",
      "\"We need to do better and everybody knows that, but we managed to turn it around again. I didn't really get to see him [Mainoo] in pre-season because I wasn't there, but all the other lads were speaking about him and saying he was an incredible talent, a generational talent.",

      "\"He showed it again today. He's an incredible talent, he's only 18 years old. I thought I was young, he's just stepping up at the age of 18.\"",
      "Hojlund assisted Rashford for the first goal and he also discussed the blossoming connection with his teammates: \"It's about time. You need to get connections inside the team and I'm always telling them that if they play the pass and I'm not there, they can scream at me and destroy me outside the pitch.",
      "\"But the opposite way, if they don't play the pass and I'm there, I can scream at them. I think it's a good chemistry we're starting to get and I think everyone can see the relationship we have now, me, Rashford and Garna.\"",

      "It is only right that Kobbie Mainoo is hailed as the hero after his sensational stoppage-time winner at Molineux on Thursday night. After all, he produced the decisive moment to end a dramatic match in which Manchester United were almost as bad as they were good.",
      "He wasn't the only United player who made a huge difference. Mainoo might be the one who adorns the back pages, but further inside, there deserves to be a special mention for Luke Shaw, a player who lifted United again.",
      "The 28-year-old caught the eye with his industrious performance against Newport at the weekend, but the real test was always going to be his first Premier League since before Christmas.",
      "Shaw has been short of match sharpness since that latest injury lay-off, yet he still lasted the entire 100 minutes at Molineux, offering a constant threat down the left wing.",
      "His partnership with Marcus Rashford is one of the most unsung in the Premier League and whenever anyone mentions the forward's remarkable 30-goal haul last season, it is important to note his support in making it happen.",
      "It is obvious Rashford has seen a clear drop-off in this season compared with last, but it is important to note Shaw's absences as a key factor in that. Shaw only missed eight matches across their mammoth 62-match campaign last season. He has missed 20 games so far this season.",
      "A key part of Rashford's game is running at isolated full-backs and exploiting the space in the channels so that he can cut inside onto his dominant foot. It can be infuriating at times and at others, it can be inspirational. However, for it to work, he needs the support of a left-back who can both underlap and overlap, draw defenders out of position and be available to exchange passes.",
      "This was no more apparent than with United's second goal of the night, when Rashford controlled the ball on the edge of the Wolves box and within seconds Shaw ran behind him to create an overload on the left wing.",
      "Shaw timed his run to perfection, reading the game so well that he was able to play a first-time cross into the near post straight into the path of Rasmus Hojlund, rather than taking a touch that would have killed momentum and meant the striker had to make another run inside the box.",
      "The left-back won't get much credit for the assist because it looked so simple. That in itself is the biggest compliment you can pay to a player who doesn't overcomplicate things.",
      "It is true that his positioning wasn't great when Wolves finally drew things level deep in injury time, though he wasn't the only United player exposed when Antony inexcusably lost the ball at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Further improvement will be required from both individuals and United as a collective in the weeks ahead, with Shaw one of those who should get even better once he has a run of games under his belt. If all goes well, he will soon be one of the first names on the teamsheet again, a player who is almost taken for granted due to his reliability and monopoly on a starting role.",

      "The Glazer family recently sold 25 per cent of shares at Old Trafford to billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who has gained control of football operations as part of the deal.",
      "Ratcliffe's bid of around £1.25billion was made official before Christmas and Joel and Avram Glazer released a joint statement in which they said they were 'delighted' with the deal. The Americans also reiterated their commitment to 'delivering success' at the club.",
      "However, many feel Ratcliffe's acquisition of a minority stake at United signals the beginning of the end for the Glazers in Manchester, following their disastrous 18 years as majority shareholders.",
      "Their long-term future at the club remains uncertain, but Avram Glazer proudly handed over a United shirt as a gift when catching up with cricketer Shaheen Afridi on Thursday night. Afridi is the current captain of the Pakistan national cricket team in the T20I format and he also plays for the Desert Vipers, who are owned by the Glazer family.",

      "He preceded to hand Afridi a gift and added: \"It was a good game and I'm also going to give you this, it's a jersey for Manchester United. If you ever want to come to Old Trafford for a match there, we would love to have you there. Or an American football game, if you watch that, so should we get a picture.\"",
      "The Glazers added the Desert Vipers to their sporting portfolio in December 2021, which means they now own a cricket franchise, United and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Desert Vipers are based in the United Arab Emirates and Avram Glazer said after that takeover of the cricket team: “I am very excited to be a part of UAE T20 at its formation.",
      "\"UAE T20 promises to be a world-class event that will be transformative to the growth of cricket in the Emirates.”",
      "The footage of Avram Glazer talking to Afridi represents his first words in public since making a statement after Ratcliffe's investment into United.",

Erik ten Hag's side moved up to seventh in the league table thanks to a Kobbie Mainoo goal in the seventh minute of stoppage time.",

      "Wolves struck two late goals from Max Kilman and Pedro Neto, with the latter coming in the fifth of nine added-on minutes in the second half. Just two minutes later though, Mainoo stepped up to win the game for United to spark jubilant scenes in the away end at Molineux.",

      "He said: \"Well, I think from the first time I've come here to see the place and meet everyone, I just knew straight away. Because I got a feeling it's just like a family. Everyone was very welcoming.",
      "\"I've obviously seen Port Vale play and they play very good football.",
      "\"My dad was shocked. He was like: 'Son, you've got to go there'. He just knew they'd take care of me and obviously, at this stage of my career, I need that because I'm still developing. He knew, straight away, he got the best feeling from here.\"",
      "Gore is friends with Vale's Manchester-born midfielder Tommy McDermott, who also urged him to agree to the switch, and he'll also see familiar faces there in the guise of ex-Reds Tom Sang and James Wilson.",
      "\"Tommy said definitely go, it'll be the best experience for you,\" added Gore. \"You'll develop really well.",
      "\"I can guarantee hard work and determination to do everything for the badge; to do our best to try to get the three points in every game. The most important thing is winning.",
      "\"I trained Monday and Tuesday and they went really good. I trained hard and am looking forward to keeping going.\"",

      "Febian Brandy was a star of Man United's academy and he played with some of the biggest names in football - but he turned down a move to Barcelona",
      "Febian Brandy grew up near Old Trafford and dreamed of playing for United. One thing he didn't expect was Barcelona wanting to sign him to join the likes of Lionel Messi.",
      "After shining in a tournament for United's academy, Barcelona made an offer for him. But he declined and chose never to look back.",
      "Brandy shared his story with the Manchester Evening News. \"I was seven when I got scouted for Manchester United,\" he said. \"I was at my primary school Holy Name and the caretaker had connections with the club. At the same time, I was playing for my local team West End Boys and I was doing well there, scouts were coming to watch me and things like that.",
      "\"No one really knows this, but I actually had two weeks at Manchester City before I went to United and I was there, but I just wanted to play football with my local friends kind of thing, so I didn't really take the Manchester City opportunity too serious.",
      "\"I didn't end up going back, I was a kid, I just wanted to play in the streets with my friends.\"",
      "However, an opportunity at United changed everything. \"I continued playing for my Sunday League team and then the opportunity at Man United came around and my mum and dad, they said 'You're not missing this opportunity!' and then I signed for United when I was seven or eight.\"",
      "From then, his training at United's academy fast-tracked Brandy's development. The quality education he received is the foundation of many successful youth players at the club.",
      "That being said, not all of Brandy's cohort were progressing at the same rate.",
      "The Mediterranean International Cup has seen some of football's biggest names participate - stars like Messi, Cesc Fabregas, Neymar and Gerard Pique. Nonetheless, during the 2005 event, it was Brandy who took centre stage.",
      "United's youth team travelled to Spain for a tournament, where they faced top clubs like Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Valencia. Brandy scored against all three teams. \"I was 15 years old and I won Player of the Tournament and top goalscorer,\" Brandy recalls.",
      "Soon after, Barcelona showed interest in him. \"A couple of weeks after, Barcelona came in for me. I'm a Manchester lad and it was nice to have them show interest in me and put an offer down, but at the time, Man United were a little bit higher than Barcelona, so it was just a normal thing to stay in Manchester,\" he said.",
      "Brandy's laid-back response to turning down Barcelona shows his easy-going nature. This attitude helped him handle pressure that others might have found difficult. His parents also played a crucial role in keeping him grounded.",
      "\"To be fair, I didn't really take the pressure. I didn't really let it get to me, I'm just one of those people that just go with the flow regardless of the hype or what's happening around me,\" Brandy added.",
      "\"I think that's always been my approach, just a cool, chilled-out and relaxed approach. I didn't really let it get to me, to be honest. United and my parents kept me grounded, so I have to thank them as well.\"",
      "Brandy's humble attitude helped him shine in United's academy. He quickly became known for his goal-scoring ability, flair and speed.",
      "United have a proud history in the FA Youth Cup, and Brandy was part of the team that reached the 2006/07 final. Unfortunately, they lost to Liverpool on penalties, but Brandy was still performing brilliantly.",
      "He had already played for England at various age levels due to his consistent performances for United. However, his most cherished memory was yet to come.",
      "That's because he was eventually included in Sir Alex Ferguson's first-team squad for the Reds' Champions League match against Roma at the Stadio Olimpico in December 2007. Ferguson fielded a young team in United's 1-1 draw in Italy, with Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick, Nani, Louis Saha and Wayne Rooney all playing. Interestingly, it was Pique who scored first before Roma equalised.",
      "Brandy, an unused substitute, had a prime view of the match. \"Probably when I was on the bench for the Champions League game against Roma [was my proudest moment], it was probably that because we didn't know what was actually happening.",
      "\"There was a few of us that trained with the first team and the boss just come in, Sir Alex, and he just said 'You're travelling tomorrow'. We were just buzzing and from the minute we left Carrington to the minute we got to Rome it was just a surreal experience.",
      "\"Just walking down the tunnel past Totti, Mexes, just really big names. I think seven youth players travelled, but he only selected three youth players to go on the bench and I was one of those - that was a surreal moment.\"",
      "As Brandy grew older and stronger, he became a regular for United's reserves, then managed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. This gave him a unique perspective on how the Norwegian was unintentionally preparing for one of the biggest jobs in management years later.",
      "\"When I was in the reserves, I played with Ole because he used to sometimes come down to get his match fitness. So I played with him and then I had him as reserve team manager,\" Brandy said.",
      "\"You could always see the traits that he had to be a manager. I've always said it. People say he's the baby-faced assassin, but he has got a side in him to get the team riled up if he needs to.",
      "\"I knew him as a player before as a coach, but Ole has this relaxed approach where he makes everyone feel at ease when he's in the room, whether you're a high-profile player or someone that's starting at the bottom.",
      "\"Ole's man-management skills, obviously not everyone will know about it, they are very good. His ability to manage someone who is a World Cup winner to somebody who hasn't really made it yet, that's what separates him from a lot of managers.",
      "\"He's got that flexible approach. In football, you need to have that approach to players otherwise you're not going to succeed because every player is different. Not every player is the same and he's got the skill to man manage every player to the best of their abilities.\"",
      "Brandy knew he needed to play first-team football to improve his skills. He realised this when he played in the Champions Youth Cup in Malaysia in 2008. \"We went there, we were playing teams like Barcelona, AC Milan, Juventus, Porto, Boca Juniors and I think Chelsea were there too,\" he said.",
      "\"I ended up winning Player of the Tournament, I scored the winning goal against Juventus in the final and I did really well. [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang was at AC Milan at that tournament actually and I came back and I thought I was going to have more first-team involvement.",
      "\"But after those performances, it didn't really happen as quick as I wanted it to, so I started to think that I might be better developing away from the club, even though I'd been there for 14 years.\"",
      "Then, Brandy decided to join Swansea on loan for the second half of the 2007/08 season. The Welsh club was then managed by Roberto Martinez and they were trying to get promoted from League One.",
      "\"It just clicked. Roberto Martinez, he was relaxed as well and there were four or five options I had to take before choosing my loan but I looked at the way I am as a player and also looked at how Swansea liked to play.",
      "\"With Martinez at Swansea, every time they used to play they used to have like 60 or 70 per cent possession, but it wasn't just pointless, they made it count. I thought to myself, keep the ball under control, they play one-touch or two-touch football.",
      "\"I just thought that approach suited me and when I went there it just clicked.\"",
      "Brandy helped Swansea move up to the Championship with his three goals and one assist in 19 league games. Martinez wanted him back for another six-month loan deal the next season.",
      "United agreed and Brandy returned. \"We are delighted to have him back. His attitude last season was excellent and we enjoyed watching a player with Premiership potential. He's a great addition to the squad,\" Martinez said about the deal.",
      "Brandy had another successful loan spell with Swansea, followed by short stints at Hereford and Gillingham. United let him go in 2010, but his friendly nature meant he made friends wherever he played.",
      "\"All the coaches, all the players, I still speak to them now and have friends in Swansea, it's a club that helped me massively and I was happy to help them get promoted from League One into the Championship and they've done well,\" he added.",
      "After leaving United, Brandy played for several clubs including Notts County, Walsall, Sheffield United, Rotherham, Crewe Alexandra and Rochdale. He also had two stints playing abroad.",
      "From his origins in Moss Side, Brandy has indeed stayed true to himself, even playing against the world's top football clubs.",

      "Manchester United will not progress to the last eight of the Continental League Cup as a result of the FA punishing Aston Villa Women, but not expelling them from the competition altogether",
      "Manchester United say they are \"very disappointed\" and are 'considering their options' following an FA ruling which has seen them dumped out of the Continental League Cup as a result of Aston Villa's administrative error.",
      "The Reds' 2-1 defeat to Manchester City last week saw them finish second in Group B, with their otherwise exemplary record in this season's competition meaning they were set to advance to the last eight as one of two best-placed runners-up. However, Aston Villa's decision to field January signing Noelle Maritz in their 7-0 win over Sunderland has had a knock-on effect on Marc Skinner's side, who will now not progress to the knockout stages.",
      "Maritz, who moved to Bescot Stadium from Women's Super League (WSL) rivals Arsenal earlier this month, was introduced in the second half against Sunderland, despite already being cup-tied. She had featured three times for the Gunners in the competition earlier in the season, starring against Bristol City, Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "READ | Major Morgan Rogers to Aston Villa transfer update as third bid tabled",
      "READ |  Tielemans starts, Bailey returns - Aston Villa starting XI vs Newcastle picked",
      "As a result, her introduction against Sunderland was in breach of Conti Cup rule 8.14 - which deals with the fielding of an ineligible player - and the points for the contest have instead been awarded to the Black Cats. An FA statement released on Monday said: \"An independent tribunal have deducted three points from Aston Villa for fielding an ineligible player during their FA Women’s Continental Tyres League Cup group stage fixture against Sunderland on Wednesday 24 January 2024.",
      "\"The FA alleged that the player was ineligible for this game, as she had previously featured in the competition for her former club, which constitutes a breach of Cup Rule 8.19. Aston Villa admitted this charge and acknowledged the breach had occurred. The independent tribunal ordered that the points deducted from Aston Villa be awarded to their opponents Sunderland, while the 7-0 scoreline is to be expunged from the record.",
      "\"As a result, Sunderland will finish as Group A winners, with Aston Villa progressing to the quarter-finals as one of the two best-placed runners-up alongside Tottenham Hotspur.\"",
      "Responding to the news, a Manchester United spokesperson said: \"We are very disappointed with this outcome and do not understand its rationale. We feel that it undermines the integrity of the competition and of the women's game. We are considering our options in response.\"",
      "United have won three of their four games in the Conti Cup this term, beating Everton 7-0, Liverpool 1-0 and Leicester City 3-1.",

      "The Reds' title hopes took a huge hit with a 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon",
      "If actions speak louder than words, then the frustration emanating from the away end at Stamford Bridge on Sunday afternoon was defeaning.",
      "A Lauren James hat-trick had ensured Manchester United were comprehensively beaten in West London by Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Chelsea. It marked a continuation of the Reds' erratic top flight form and almost certainly sounded the death knell for their title hopes this term.",
      "As manager Marc Skinner and his players stood applauding the travelling support, a banner was unfurled in the Shed End. The words 'Skinner Out' were daubed in big red letters - the physical embodiment of a sentiment that has been brewing for some time in some quarters of the United fanbase.",
      "Only a few short weeks ago, Skinner came out in defence of the fans who had called for his removal at a training match against PSV Eindhoven in Malta. Following reports of club stewards asking for supporters to stop the critical chanting, the United boss insisted fans should be encouraged to voice their opinions, no matter how disconcerting they may be to hear.",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Berrada speaks with the MEN",
      "But on Sunday in SW6, it felt as if new battle lines had been drawn. Supporters - albeit a minority of them - had aired their greivances in full view of the watching TV cameras, and the load on Skinner's shoulders looked to weigh heavier than ever.",
      "In his defence, there are few teams in Europe with the ability to stem the Chelsea tide when the reigning WSL champions are in full flow. And, from the moment the first whistle blew at Stamford Bridge, the hosts looked every inch like a side who knew exactly what was at stake.",
      "Lose and they would open the door for United to announce themselves as serious title contenders. Win and they would all but bury the Reds' hopes of seizing their WSL crown.",
      "Perhaps predictably, it was Lauren James who landed the first blow. The former United forward - who returned to her childhood club for a WSL record fee in 2021 - finished from a tight angle to put Chelsea ahead inside the first five minutes.",
      "Her celebration in front of the travelling United fans - some of whom had taunted her as she stood over a corner-kick in the opening exchanges - only served to rub further salt into the wound. James struck again in the 23rd minute, rifling home after a sublime ball over the top from Nathalie Bjorn to really underscore the hosts' dominance.",
      "Despite being under the cosh for much of the first half, Hayley Ladd handed United a lifeline on the stroke of half-time, smashing in from close range to set up a tense second act in the capital. And United did look to be in the ascendency after the restart, with Ella Toone thwarted by a last-ditch Ashley Lawrence tackle moments before Lucia Garcia nodded wide at the back post.",
      "The Reds once again came close to restoring parity on the hour mark when Hannah Hampton - a spectator for much of the first half - smothered Ladd's goalbound effort. Those of United persuasion might also have felt aggrieved to see referee Abigail Byrne wave away their appeals for a penalty after Lawrence's nudge on Leah Galton inside the area.",
      "Certainly, Skinner's acrimony was clear for all to see. \"You're f****** joking\", the United boss yelled as he paced up and down in his technical area, incandescent at the perceived injustice. But the Reds only had themselves to blame when James breached their backline once again in the 85th minute.",
      "Her third goal of the day put the exclamation point on a performance that served to evidence Chelsea's continued superiority over the team that proved to be their closest challengers last season. \"Skinner, what's the score?\" crowed a gaggle of home supporters in the East Stand as the game ebbed towards the final whistle.",
      "Naturally, there was no response from the United boss. But he will have been all too aware of the repercussions this defeat - United's third of the season - might have.",
      "\"I have no doubt what I am going to achieve with this team,\" he insisted after the game. \"I'm not going to let (criticism) drip into my psyche. My job is to stay focused on what I want to achieve with this team - that's success.\"",
      "Of course, there is still every chance this season does transpire to be a successful one for United. They are still in both domestic cups and are not entirely out of the race for a European spot.",
      "But Sunday's showing in the capital might just have marked the end of the Reds' title charge. And Skinner will know results must quickly improve or it might just spell the beginning of the end of his United tenure.",

      "Ella Toone looked back to her best for Manchester United in Sunday's 5-0 FA Cup win over Newcastle United and manager Marc Skinner has backed his star after criticism of her recent form",
      "With 28 minutes on the clock at Leigh Sports Village, Ella Toone cut the figure of a footballing superhero.",
      "The England international had just put Manchester United 1-0 up in their FA Cup fourth-round tie with third-tier Newcastle United. She celebrated by standing, hands planted on hips, and basking in the adulation of the home support.",
      "The Zorro-esque mask she wore - a precautionary measure to protect the facial injury she sustained during a training match last week - only served to further enhance her celestial likeness. All that was missing, in fact, was a cape.",
      "From the moment the first whistle blew in Greater Manchester, Toone looked for all the world like a woman on a mission. She saw her goal-bound shot deflect wide inside the first five minutes before Newcastle goalkeeper Grace Donnelly lunged to acrobatically tip her fine effort from range onto the bar.",
      "And, as the game ebbed toward the half-hour mark, United's no. 7 finally made the breakthrough, lashing a ferocious left-footed strike into the roof of Donnelly's net. It was a goal that set Marc Skinner's side on their way to a crucial win and perhaps set the wheels in motion for Toone's own personal resurgence.",
      "The 24-year-old established herself as one of the most exciting prospects in the women's game at the European Championships in 2022, adopting the role of super-sub alongside best friend and former clubmate Alessia Russo. She came off the bench to inspire England's quarter-final comeback against Spain before her exquisite lobbed finish helped the Lionesses topple Germany in the final.",
      "Her antics on the pitch have since led to her assuming superstar status off it but, while her star has continued to rise outside of football, her form for both club and country over the past 18 months has failed to hit her previously lofty heights. Last term, she managed three goals for United in the Women's Super League (WSL) - a tally she has already matched after just 10 games this season.",
      "At last summer's Women's World Cup, all of Toone's key metrics - from touches, to chances created, to successful passes - were down compared to her displays at the Euros while, to the naked eye, she lacked the vim and vigour that helped propel England to European glory. The scintillating form of Chelsea's Lauren James saw the United midfielder lose her starting spot in the Lionesses' midfield part-way through the tournament, leading some to question her credentials as a regular fixture in Sarina Wiegman's side.",
      "But, against Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, Toone looked back to her best, adding a fine assist to her superb goal and ensuring she was at the centre of almost all of United's positive play.",
      "“She took a lot of criticism that I thought she didn’t deserve, because everyone has high standards of her,” Skinner said of Toone after the game. “It’s like Manchester United, everyone always has high standards and if you don’t match that there’s a crisis.",
      "“But what Ella has been doing really well is simplifying her game. When she draws pressure, she releases, but she releases it with quality and she moves again. She’s been a breath of fresh air. Her attitude towards her own development again is right back in where it needs to be and it’s only a good sign.”",
      "The United boss also attributed Toone's sublime display to the remedial nature of the WSL's winter break. Sunday's clash constituted the Red Devils' first competitive game in almost a month and some time off seemingly acted as a welcome tonic for their midfield maestro, who has been close to an ever-present for both club and country over the past two seasons.",
      "Last term, Toone featured in every one of United's WSL games as Skinner's side pushed Chelsea all the way in the title race. Add to that the fact she played more minutes for England than any other player during the year between the Euros ending and the World Cup beginning and it's unsurprising the midfielder's form took a bit of a dip.",
      "“I think she was able to get away (in the winter break), she went on holiday with her family and that enabled her to refresh,” Skinner said.. “Tooney will tell you, she wants to play every minute of every game forever, but the reality is, humans often don’t know what’s best for them.",
      "\"It’s also a pleasure to manage someone who wants to play every second. She loves football. If she’s not playing it, she’ll watch it, she’ll be at Manchester United men’s games if she’s not playing at Manchester United Women.”",
      "While Toone's passion for the game has never been in doubt, her showing against Newcastle offered a potent reminder of her irrefutable quality. Speaking after the game, the midfielder told club media: \"It was nice to get on the scoresheet and it was a good time to score before half-time. We knew what we had to do today. We knew we had to break them down and I thought we did that really well.\"",
      "On her celebration, Toone quipped: \"It was Batman. I was wearing a mask because I broke my nose in Malta so I was Batman and then a few of the girls jumped on it as well.\"",
      "With United currently fourth in the WSL, it looks unlikely they will go on to claim the league title this term. But, with Toone looking to have recovered her superpowers on the pitch, the Reds at least stand half a chance of picking up some silverware in the coming months.",

      "Manchester United's star goalkeeper Mary Earps is in demand as she enters the last six months of her contract",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps has joined the A&V Sports agency amid uncertainty surrounding her future with the Reds.",
      "Earps has entered into the last six months of her contract with United and there are no guarantees she will be extending her stay. Barcelona, PSG and Arsenal have all been linked with the 30-year-old who is in-demand.",
      "The shot stopper's stock rose last year thanks to a sensational 12 months for club and country. Among the many accolades she accumulated were BBC Sports Personality of the Year, England Women's Player of the Year and she was also named Manchester United fans' Player of the Year, across the men's and women's teams, by MEN Sport readers.",
      "Back in December, United's head coach Marc Skinner declared he was hopeful Earps would commit to a new contract. \"The club are working through with Mary on what the deal looks like,\" Skinner told the Daily Mirror.",
      "\"I sit here hopeful. I think the talks are exactly where it was. It’s with the club to continue with that. I can’t be any more clear that I want Mary to stay at this club.",
      "\"She’s a huge part of what I want to do and build here but we’ll continue to have those conversations. I haven’t really got an update yet.\"",
      "Earps' new representatives are one of the top agencies in women's football and look after the likes of Sam Kerr, Ada Hegerberg and Catarina Macario. The United 'keeper signed her last contract back in 2021.",

      "Manchester United have won four out of their last six games, with Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo impressing; both teenagers have stepped up for Erik ten Hag ahea dof the season run-in;  watch Man Utd vs West Ham live on Sky Sports this Sunday from 1pm; kick-off 2pm",
      "Saturday 3 February 2024 08:51, UK",
      "If Erik ten Hag ends up having a long-term future at Manchester United, he may look back at two tactical tweaks that acted as turning points this season.",
      "The irony is the players involved do not come from the £380m United have spent on signings under his tenure. Instead, they are two players who cost nothing at all - and both have helped keep United's season alive.",
      "Promoting Kobbie Mainoo to United first-team regular was the first switch in November. A month later, Ten Hag decided to start Alejandro Garnacho on the right wing for the first time against Aston Villa.",
      "And since Christmas, the two teenagers - who were part of Man Utd's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2022 - have produced big first-team moments when Ten Hag needed it most.",
      "Mainoo's stunning late strike in United's 4-3 win over Wolves took the headlines, but his all-round game stood out on Thursday night - rubberstamping the midfielder's status as one of this season's breakout stars.",
      "The 18-year-old ended the Wolves game with a 100 per cent passing record and more ball recoveries than any player on the pitch. \"His temperament and composure is off the scale. He's got the world at his feet for the next few years,\" added Gary Neville to Sky Sports about the teenager's performance.",
      "Go back further in this season and Mainoo's overall numbers since he broke into the United first-team clearly brand him a welcome addition to a midfield where Christian Eriksen, Scott McTominay and Mason Mount have failed to nail down a regular spot.",
      "Mainoo's clearance and duel records show how well he can read the game at one end of the pitch. His goals in back-to-back games against Newport and Wolves show he can be equally effective at the other.",
      "But perhaps tweaking Garnacho's position from left wing to right has been equally influential to United's improvement, despite being less subtle.",
      "In his debut right-wing start against Villa, Garnacho scored twice in United's dramatic 3-2 comeback win. With that game representing the INEOS investment's first official trip to see Ten Hag's United, it felt like a big moment in the Dutchman's Old Trafford career.",
      "And since that match, Garnacho has been regularly used on right flank and, just like Mainoo, his numbers have stood out.",
      "The 19-year-old has been one of the top 10 players in the Premier League for chance creation, taking on and beating his defender - and high-press regains: one of Ten Hag's key buzzwords.",
      "In fact, Garnacho has been impressing under the surface for a while as the Argentine's dribbling numbers have been impressive all season - even when he was on the left.",
      "The young winger has created 31 chances via ball carries - that's two more than Mohamed Salah despite Garnacho playing 500 fewer minutes - while only Man City's Phil Foden has more out of any Premier League player.",
      "It makes Garnacho one of the Premier League's top dribblers this season and it has helped unlock a United attack that once struggled for goals.",
      "Before the young Argentine was moved to right wing, United had failed to score in four straight matches at the start of December, even with Bruno Fernandes, one of the most creative players in the league, in their attack.",
      "But since that game, Marcus Rashford has goals in back-to-back Premier League games, while Rasmus Hojlund has three goals and two assists in his last three top-flight matches. Ten Hag can feel something growing with his front four.",
      "The performances of Garnacho and Mainoo - both with a combined age of 36, or one Jonny Evans - have propelled United from an inconsistent side to a more stable team with something to fight for.",
      "Four wins in their last six, plus an FA Cup last-16 appearance to come, means there is light at the end of what has been a long tunnel for Ten Hag this season.",
      "Remember that old United saying: 'You can't win anything with kids'? United haven't won anything yet this season, but these two youngsters are taking these kids in the right direction.",

      "Friday 2 February 2024 20:27, UK",
      "Our tipster Jones Knows provides his betting insight and analysis across all 10 Premier League games as he hunts some value in Sky Bet's markets.",
      "I'm losing faith with Everton, who look to be running out of steam and confidence in front of goal.",
      "It's now just four goals scored in their last nine games. Sean Dyche's team are surely going to need to score twice to win this one as Spurs are reliable at finding the net having scored in their last 34 Premier League games. The away side look fair enough at 4/6 with Sky Bet on the draw no bet market.",
      "I'm heading for the player offsides market though for a better angle in where Dominic Calvert-Lewin is worth an interest at 3/1 with Sky Bet to be caught offside two or more times. The Spurs offside trap isn't quite Aston Villa levels of bravery but they squeeze the game very aggressively too - as shown by their per 90 average of 3.6 offsides against over their last 15 Premier League games.",
      "Calvert-Lewin will be tasked with playing on that line, being the target of Everton's direct balls forward.",
      "No team have attempted more long passes this season (1,366) and only Liverpool have attempted more passes into the opposition half than Everton (1,424) - two key pointers towards direct play into the attacker. Calvert-Lewin himself has been flagged offside 10 times in his last nine starts whilst opposition centre-forwards Ivan Toney and Rasmus Hojlund both were flagged twice in Tottenham's last two games.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise.",
      "Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer in the same timeframe. That's now beginning to become a healthy sample size - and it's backed up by a drastic decline of their attacking metrics under De Zerbi.",
      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season.",
      "Roy Hodgson knows exactly how to play the frustration game on Brighton's style having restricted them to just four goals in his last five games against them as Palace boss. Six of the last nine meetings between these two have finished 1-1 whilst all those encounters, bar one, have fallen under the 2.5 goals line. Palace look a great bet to avoid defeat in the double chance market at 11/10 with Sky Bet. A Palace win to nil at 9/1 also shouldn't be sniffed at.",
      "Fulham are due a win at Burnley.",
      "Somehow the Clarets have remained unbeaten in the last 31 matches at Turf Moor in all competitions, winning 25 times. It's a run that spans 73 years. Remarkable. Thoughts with the Fulham fans out there that regularly make the journey there.",
      "This might be the game though to break the hoodoo. Sky Bet have them at 7/5 to pick up three points - that's a 42 per cent chance. Remember, Burnley, albeit improving, have the worst home record in the Premier League, winning just four points from 11 games, losing nine. Away win.",
      "Sign me up for the total corner count.",
      "When Newcastle are at their best, they are a corner-winning machine. They won 270 corners last season in the Premier League, the most of any team. I've been waiting for them to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",
      "Meanwhile, regular readers know all about my obsession with Luton's ability to win corners. They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner-winning opportunities should be rife at both ends.",
      "Premier League games are averaging 10.6 corners per 90 minutes this season, up on last year's average of 10.1, probably owing to the extra added time. This game should surpass that number, therefore the 5/6 with Sky Bet on 11 or more corners in the match being awarded rates as a fantastic value play. As do 14 or more (3/1), 15 or more (9/2) and 16 or more (7/1) - all of which look likely to give you a great run at nice prices.",
      "My needle barometer is pointing towards high chance of cards and chaos under the Bramall Lane lights. This is a fixture with a recent trend of spice, with six yellow cards in a tetchy reverse game and red cards shown to Jon Egan and Phil Jagielka in the previous two encounters. If Sheffield United can stay in the game, frustrations in the away ranks may grow.",
      "I want to back cards.",
      "The yellow card count in Premier League matches remain at a record high levels of 4.47 per 90.",
      "There has been a slight drop off compared to August and September as referees have become a little more lenient when it comes to timewasting but the overall average yellows per 90 for October onwards is still a healthy 4.32.",
      "All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach.",
      "Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more. Remember we get the bonus of a red card counting for 25 booking points towards that total, too, if one is shown. The 5/6 with Sky Bet for 50+ booking points is a lovely slice of value with also the higher lines of 60+ (15/8) and 70+ (9/4) also worth a second look.",
      "Nottingham Forest's key to success under Nuno Espirito Santo will be how successful their counter-attacking game works, especially away from home as shown in their impressive win at Newcastle. That doesn't bode well for them for this encounter though as they are up against a Bournemouth side that are notoriously hard to counter-attack. The Cherries have shipped just 1.38 worth of expected goals from fast breaks this season - it's the third best record in the Premier League when it comes to that metric. Forest may struggle to cause problems.",
      "Adding Dominic Solanke to score to a home win considering he's found the net 10 times in last 11 appearances in all competitions makes sense at 6/4 with Sky Bet should provide punters with a good run.",
      "I don't want any part of the 4/7 with Sky Bet on a Chelsea win.",
      "Can you trust them to get back on a positive footing following such a lacklustre and timid performance at Liverpool? I certainly can't especially against a Wolves side that beat them 2-1 over the Christmas period.",
      "Gary O'Neil's side do carry a big threat in the final third to the extent they've scored 33 goals this season - that's two more than they managed in the whole of last season. The three they got in their defeat to Manchester United makes it 18 goals scored in their last eight matches.",
      "Wolves' goal threat isn't really being respected by the market with Pedro Neto and Matheus Cunha both priced up at 4/1 to score. That looks generous in a game Wolves are capable of avoiding defeat in.",
      "West Ham are sixth in the Premier League and have lost just one of their last 11 Premier League games.",
      "Yet there is clear discontent in the stands - for good reason too.",
      "West Ham's underlying performance metrics this season scream 'overachievement' loud and clear. Based on expected goals for and against, equated into points won, West Ham have 11 points more than their performance data shows. The addition of Kalvin Phillips has only provided David Moyes with more problems to contend with in terms of his balance in midfield.",
      "I was expecting Manchester United to be shorter than the 3/5 with Sky Bet on offer considering their increased productivity in front of goal since Christmas, scoring 10 in their last four games and Rasmus Hojlund looking the part as the focal point. Home win.",
      "Huge. A Super Sunday to savour.",
      "A win for Liverpool may catapult them into title favourites with Sky Bet and would end Arsenal's hopes of landing the main prize. Jurgen Klopp will know that. He's not one to shirk such opportunities either. Liverpool will be Liverpool.",
      "The jeopardy is huge for Arsenal, who are still to prove they possess the attacking metrics to mix it with Manchester City and Klopp's men at the business end of this season. It looks a two-horse race to me.",
      "What's the bet then?",
      "It must be a pro-Liverpool angle based on their attacking metrics of late, where they've averaged 22.5 shots per 90 minutes in their last 11 matches. And despite him letting us down for the 8/1 best bet treble in midweek, I'm keeping the faith with Curtis Jones and his shots prices. He's had 22 shots in his last eight fixtures. The 2/1 with Sky Bet on him firing two or more does make plenty of appeal.",
      "This won't be a straightforward night for Pep Guardiola's side but those taking them on at 4/11 with Sky Bet are likely to end up with burnt fingers such is their focus and supreme reliability at this time of year. City won 14 of 15 Premier League games between the 22nd-36th Premier League gameweeks last season. This is their time.",
      "My punting instincts have taken me to the player fouls market where Ruben Dias rates as a fair wager to make two or more fouls at 100/30 with Sky Bet. The Brentford front two of Neal Maupay and Ivan Toney bring the nuisance factor to the table in that they are very smart at winning fouls.",
      "Since being paired together in their last two fixtures, they've won 12 fouls between them. It's a ratio that should stay consistent so it certainly brings Dias into the mix in terms of his foul probability. He's made two or more fouls in seven of his last 13 starts, making 17 fouls in total. He will fight fire with fire up against the Brentford duo. He's a big price.",

      "I should be sitting here writing with a spring in my step of +16 points of profit, instead it was a -2 return despite winning angles galore.",
      "Let's start with the 8/1 treble of Luton to win five or more corners, both teams to score 'no' in Everton and Fulham and Curtis Jones to have two or more shots vs Chelsea. Luton won five corners in the first 35 minutes - boom - Everton and Fulham finished 0-0 - boom - so we were looking pretty heading into Liverpool vs Chelsea. In game where Liverpool dominated and had 28 shots, Jones somehow managed just one. Bet down.",
      "Now, those that followed me in on the second bet of Luton to win eight or more corners vs Brighton at 8/1 will be feeling similar pain. As referenced, Luton were winning corners for fun in their battering of Brighton. On 55 minutes, they were sitting on seven corners and still creating attacking opportunities. The 8/1 shot had become a 1/5 shot, probably shorter.",
      "We needed just one corner. Just one. The time ticked by. There were deflections that rolled close to the by-line and ricochets near the corner flag. But no more Luton corners were won. Bet down.",
      "This game, eh? She can be a cruel mistress.",
      "Brighton's complete capitulation at Luton perhaps shouldn't have come as a surprise. Roberto De Zerbi's side have won just three of their last 16 Premier League games, scoring just 20 goals in that period. Only Everton, Crystal Palace and Sheffield United have scored fewer.

      "Since beating Bournemouth in September, Brighton's goals, expected goals, shots and big chances created per 90 have plummeted compared to where they were towards the back end of last season. Palace have the tools to frustrate and leave the Amex with a result at a bulky 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Corners simply have to be backed in Newcastle vs Luton. I've been waiting for the Toon to return to form with eyes firmly fixed on their corner count lines and now is the time to back them following their very impressive performance at Aston Villa.",

They racked up seven at home to Brighton, taking their tally to 49 corners in their last six fixtures. I'm fully expecting both teams to play with confidence and attacking intent, so corner winning opportunities should be rife at both ends. Backing 11 or more should go close at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "To complete the treble, I'm hoping for referee Paul Tierney to be in fussy mood after a week in the spotlight when he takes charge of Sheffield United vs Aston Villa. All six of Sheffield United's recent home games have seen the 50+ bookings points land as Chris Wilder has installed a more aggressive approach. Meanwhile, every one of Aston Villa's last 11 Premier League games have seen 40+ total booking points with seven of those producing 50+ or more.",

      "Friday 2 February 2024 14:03, UK",
      "Kobbie Mainoo scored a sensational 97th-minute winner for Manchester United after Wolves themselves had levelled in stoppage time in a stunning 4-3 game at Molineux.",
      "Marcus Rashford, restored to the team, opened the scoring and Rasmus Hojlund doubled the lead before the break with United dominant but the drama had hardly begun.",
      "Pablo Sarabia pulled one back from the spot before another substitute, Scott McTominay restored the two-goal advantage. Max Kilman's late goal offered Wolves hope and Pedro Neto thought he had secured a point before Mainoo's magnificent winner.",
      "It was a breathless contest to ultimately delight the visiting Manchester United support, although even the crestfallen home team were applauded from the pitch.",
      "Wolves had not lost at home since being beaten by Liverpool in September and could have moved above United with victory. Instead, they remain 11th in the table while Ten Hag's team are up to seventh.",
      "Wolves: Sa (5), Kilman (6), Dawson (6), Toti (4), Semedo (6), Doyle (6), Lemina (6), Doherty (4), Bellegarde (5), Neto (7), Cunha (7).\n\n\nSubs: Ait-Nouri (7), Sarabia (7), Gomes (n/a), Fraser (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd: Onana (5), Dalot (6), Varane (6), Martinez (6), Shaw (6), Mainoo (8), Casemiro (6), Garnacho (6), Fernandes (7), Rashford (7), Hojlund (7).\n\n\nSubs: Antony (5), McTominay (7), Maguire (n/a), Evans (n/a), Forson (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the match: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Ten Hag said before kick-off that this might be Manchester United's strongest side and things would look different once the injured players had returned and they played as if that were true during the opening period, scoring before Wolves had really had a kick.",
      "Hojlund laid the ball off to Rashford and the returning favourite caressed the ball beyond Jose Sa and into the corner of the net. It oozed cool and made a mockery of the fuss that has surrounded him all week. United just seemed to grow in confidence thereafter.",
      "Wolves were tactically undone for the second goal, Neto failing to track the powerful off-the-ball run of Luke Shaw and when Rashford slipped him in, the full-back's low cross was bundled into the net by Hojlund after earlier ricocheting off Craig Dawson and Sa.",
      "Hojlund almost had another when Matt Doherty's under-hit pass to the goalkeeper resulted in the clearance cannoning off him but just wide. The Denmark forward was then denied when a narrow offside decision went against him after tucking the ball away late in the first half.",
      "Casemiro, booked early on but otherwise restoring control to United's midfield, found the net with a header before that half was through but was again offside and the onus was on O'Neil to change things at the break. The tone of the game certainly shifted.",
      "Kilman had a header cleared from near the line by Lisandro Martinez, making his first Premier League start since September. Hojlund then spurned a good chance after an error by Toti Gomes. But the penalty offered Wolves a route back into it.",
      "The decision to award the spot-kick was soft, Casemiro barely connecting with Neto - if at all. But Sarabia, on as a substitute, converted and the crowd were in the game. United struck again. McTominay did not even have to jump to nod in United's third from a corner.",
      "Again, Wolves fought back. They showed real spirit in the second half, defending that long unbeaten run at home. Dawson's miscued shot was turned in by Kilman to set up a big finish. Neto delivered it when United inexplicably allowed a counter-attack.",
      "His shot appeared to wrong-foot Andre Onana and Molineux was wild, dreaming of an unlikely winner of their own. But, amid a raucous atmosphere, it was Mainoo who was calm while others were not, skipping away from two before curling effortlessly into the corner.",
      "It was a goal that will be talked about for years, the biggest moment of his fledgling career to date - and a big moment for his manager and team. Had United let this slip, it would have been damning. But this was a night to remember for the right reasons, instead.",
      "\"To be honest, I have mixed feelings,\" said Ten Hag. \"For the neutral, for the spectator, it is great to see. But as a manager, when you have dominated for an hour and should be three or four up, the way we concede the goals, we should manage it better, it cannot happen.\"",
      "\"Incredibly proud of some of what we produced, the resilience, the togetherness, the quality, there were large spells when we looked close to being an excellent team,\" said the Wolves boss. \"There were little bits that we need to improve, obviously.\"",
      "He added: \"The two goals in the second half, very disappointing as it is down to detail. The throw-in at the end is not how we defend throw-ins.",
      "\"You are tested in the Premier League, the emotion of it. We go completely off plan [after Rashford's early goal] and start opening up big spaces. But in terms of the togetherness, the work ethic, I thought second half, we were by far the better side.\"",
      "Sky Sports' Gary Neville:",
      "\"I was a part of those games when you've given a goal away at one end and somehow one of your special players would do something special and the goal was sensational by Mainoo. We've seen different types of goals but for him to keep such composure and put the ball in between someone's legs and the finish!",
      "\"He's a fantastic player. I think to come into Man Utd team in any team is very difficult and he's come into the team in one of the club's most difficult times in recent history and he's just stood out as being someone whose temperament and composure is off the scale.",
      "\"He's got the world at his feet for the next few years and there's been an example where you can get carried away: Marcus Rashford had the same. But he's got 15 years coming up, Mainoo, where he's got to keep feet on the ground. But he's got all the attributes that you would need to be a top player.\"",

      "Plus from Wednesday: Connor Bradley steals the show as Liverpool beat Chelsea; Julian Alvarez grabs the headlines as Erling Haaland returns for Man City in their win over Burnley; Timo Werner shows the value of Tottenham conducting their transfer business early as he helps beat Brentford",
      "Friday 2 February 2024 00:50, UK",
      "“He’s making incredible progress. He is the modern midfield player.” Erik ten Hag was effusive in his praise for Kobbie Mainoo after his dramatic winner at Wolves - and understandably so.",
      "Casemiro. Fred. Donny van de Beek. Nemanja Matic. So many millions have been spent by Manchester United as they tried to find a player to command their midfield. Now, it seems an answer may have sprung from their academy.",
      "To prove Ten Hag’s point, Mainoo excelled in attack and defence at Molineux, ranking joint-first among United players for possession wins (six) while also sealing the points with a goal of rare composure.",
      "It’s already clear Mainoo is part of United’s strongest XI. He offers more physicality than Christian Eriksen, more skill than Scott McTominay and more dynamism than Casemiro.",
      "If Mainoo maintains his current trajectory, it’s not unreasonable to think he could even sneak into an England squad that is not exactly blessed with midfielders at the peak of their form.",
      "But even if he falls short in that aim, the 18-year-old looks as though he has saved United a fortune in the transfer market.Joe Shread",
      "Gary O'Neil spent much of his post-match press conference discussing the challenge of trying - and ultimately failing - to bring in another striker this transfer window but Wolves managed to score three goals against Manchester United and still lost.",
      "It was the details that cost them. The third goal from a corner was routine and the fourth goal came from a throw-in. Wolves appeared caught up in the emotion of the game, while Mainoo was the coolest character in the stadium. It proved the difference.",
      "O'Neil prides himself on those tactical details, which is perhaps why he was so frustrated that his match-preparation time had been disrupted by trying to get a deal over the line. He described having a game on deadline day as a \"terrible idea\" afterwards.",
      "But if there was some comfort in being beaten at home for the first time in over four months it was that even in a sloppy performance, there was a spirit, a work ethic, the sort of togetherness that has his team in mid-table rather than facing the drop as some expected.",
      "Wolves have served up some drama already at Molineux this season, beating Manchester City, Tottenham and Chelsea. They came out on the wrong side of this seven-goal thriller but it said plenty that their players were applauded off the pitch at the end of the game.Adam Bate",
      "David Moyes threw Kalvin Phillips in at the deep and to a certain extent it backfired, but having not made a single start in the Premier League this season for Man City, the England international was always going to take time to get up to speed.",
      "He endured a nightmare start to his West Ham debut, playing the ball straight to Dominic Solanke to score Bournemouth's opener. His struggles continued during the first half and an off-the-pace Phillips was eventually replaced in the 68th minute by Danny Ings.",
      "However, Phillips' lack of sharpness was probably understandable considering his bit-part role at Man City over the last couple of years.",
      "What is important now is how the 28-year-old improves from here. He's been crying out for minutes, particularly as he tries to win a place in England's Euro 2024 squad this summer.",
      "After his first start against Bournemouth, he will be hoping more follow and that he can build and improve quickly.Oliver Yew",
      "David Moyes' pre- and post-match commentary was telling. \"We've had to rejig,\" he said before kick-off, in reference to Kalvin Phillips' inclusion. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing,\" he conceded after the full-time whistle.",
      "The teamsheet looked imbalanced from the off. Four central midfielders and no striker. Of course Moyes has been hamstrung by injuries and absences in recent weeks, but attempting to crowbar four midfielders into the starting XI caused more harm than good against high-pressing Bournemouth.",
      "Phillips looked lost. Edson Alvarez was scrappy and ineffective. Tomas Soucek and James Ward-Prowse were better, but ever-changing shape restricted their influence. Debutant Phillips registered an error leading to a goal with only his second touch in a Hammers shirt - it was all a bit messy and confused.",
      "That will be the first and last time we'll see that midfield concoction this season, or ever. Question is, where does Phillips fit now? West Ham's central trio - Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Soucek - have forged good connections in the first half of this season. Why disrupt it unnecessarily?Laura Hunter",
      "The roar that greeted Conor Bradley's goal in Liverpool's 4-1 win over Chelsea was that little bit louder than the rest. It was a reward for his fine form since coming into the side but it was also a reminder that Jurgen Klopp is building an exciting new team.",
      "Bradley has looked assured defensively, combative in the tackle, impressive in possession and has now shown a finishing ability that Liverpool striker Darwin Nunez would envy. He is more than filling in for Trent Alexander-Arnold. He was a worthy player of the match.",
      "With two assists as well as his goal, the Northern Ireland international has certainly won over the Anfield crowd - they chanted his name more than once on the night. He looks like a strength rather than a weakness, highlighting the depth in this squad now.",
      "That gives Klopp options, the opportunity to deploy Alexander-Arnold in midfield rather than at right-back, for instance. Expect him to have a big impact this season and beyond. At a time when the focus is on Liverpool stories coming to an end, another is just beginning.Adam Bate",
      "Once again, it's two steps forward, two steps back for Chelsea. After winning three in a row in the Premier League for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino, his side produced a woeful display at Anfield.",
      "It was the same in November, when Chelsea followed up impressive results against Tottenham and Manchester City by getting thrashed at Newcastle.",
      "But even more worrying than the inconsistency - or the one-sided result - was the nature of Chelsea's performance against Liverpool.",
      "Jurgen Klopp's side were predictably fired up in their first Premier League game since he announced his planned exit, but it seemingly caught Chelsea by surprise.",
      "The visitors were second to everything. They continuously gave the ball away in dangerous areas. They lost their runners.",
      "Investing in youth has had the predictable consequence of leaving Chelsea short of two vital components that make up successful teams - experience and leadership.",
      "Never was it more apparent than on Wednesday night.Joe Shread",
      "Erling Haaland's return from injury against Burnley was a major boost for Manchester City. His second-half introduction was cheered as loudly as any of their goals. But it was Julian Alvarez who inflicted most of the damage on the night.",
      "His double, scored in the space of six first-half minutes, took him to eight for the campaign in the Premier League and 15 overall. He also has six assists. He is quietly having an excellent season.",
      "And yet a look at the statistics on Wednesday night suggests he did little other than score. The Argentine only had 24 touches, by far the fewest of City's starters, and only completed 12 passes. His goals came from his only two shots of the night.",
      "The Argentine is an atypical Manchester City player, low-touch but high-efficiency, and it is that streamlined effectiveness that makes him so important to Pep Guardiola. Alvarez is not the beating heart of this team but he almost always affects games.",
      "It is for that reason that he has become so prominent. In the Premier League so far this season, the 24-year-old is the only Manchester City player to have started all 21 games.",
      "The assumption is that Haaland's return will bump him out of the team. But do not be surprised if Guardiola continues to find room for him. This was just one of many games this season in which he has underlined his importance.Nick Wright",
      "With James Maddison making his first start since November, the England international was all set to grab the headlines, but it was Timo Werner who impressed most in attack.",
      "The German was a constant threat down the left and caused Brentford plenty of problems, grabbing an assist for the second goal.",
      "His eye-catching performance drew praise from Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "\"I thought he was great,\" the Australian said. \"He's a quality player. As he gets stronger and fitter and understands our game a little bit better, I think he'll become even more effective.",
      "\"I know there's goals in him as well and that will come with time.\"",
      "Spurs usually leave their business towards the end of the transfer window but this month they acted early by bringing in Werner on loan, and that swift action is paying off.Declan Olley",

      "Marcus Rashford has been the focus of yet another disciplinary breach at Man Utd; this is the third time the England forward has clashed with Erik ten Hag over transgressions; INEOS want to introduce a culture change at Manchester United, but will Rashford's behaviour fit into it?",
      "Wednesday 31 January 2024 09:47, UK",
      "If the words in Manchester United's statement on Marcus Rashford, released late on Monday night, sounded familiar, it is not a trick of the mind.",
      "Two months ago, when the England international partied at Chinawhite nightclub after the derby undressing against Manchester City, Erik ten Hag said \"he apologised and that is it. It is an internal matter\".",
      "The location and context has changed - Rashford reporting himself ill for training last Friday after going out in Belfast the previous two nights - but the protagonist and United's communication remains the same.",
      "Erik ten Hag will face the media at 12.30pm on Wednesday - follow it live on the Sky Sports app and website.",
      "\"Marcus has taken responsibility for his actions,\" read the club's statement. \"This has been dealt with as an internal disciplinary matter, which is now closed.\"",
      "Rashford has to ensure it is indeed shut - and not just for a matter of weeks. It is the third time the 26-year-old has been caught transgressing under Ten Hag, the first of which was arriving late for a team meeting.",
      "That seemed innocuous, but his actions since have sparked concerns - even before the tequila-filled details of Thursday emerged from an alleged eyewitness account.",
      "It's not solely Rashford's focus that is in question, but a harsher spotlight is now on the continuous off-field issues at United.",
      "It was during September, in the immediate aftermath of Jadon Sancho's social media offensive against being a \"scapegoat\", that warnings of misbehaviour from other members of the squad began to circulate.",
      "Several privy to the winger's anger at being singled out, isolated, and effectively cancelled at the club before rejoining Borussia Dortmund on loan, insisted there were players flouting Ten Hag's standards at Carrington and beyond.",
      "When Rashford was celebrating at Chinawhite in the early morning despite needing to report to training at the end of October, it was flagged as an example.",
      "However, the incident was brushed aside as a one-off by people close to the forward; it was simply a pre-arranged birthday party.",
      "Ten Hag had also insisted Rashford was \"very motivated to put things right. I know how much effort he is putting in. He makes a mistake but that doesn't say he is not fitting in.",
      "\"He is totally with us. He makes one mistake but also off the pitch what he is doing, how he lives, I am sure he is doing everything right to help the team and to perform and let us win.\"",
      "Managers do not take well to having their authority undermined, being misled, and let down after publicly standing up for a player.",
      "Rashford's repeated eroding of the standards and rules set under the Dutchman is set to send him on a collision course with Ten Hag, but he is also at high risk of clashing with the \"clean culture\" INEOS aim to implement under their sporting control.",
      "As Sky Sports revealed in December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe will implement a more ruthless approach to United's process over player contracts in a bid to prioritise the right ethos and recruitment strategy over business interests.",
      "United want to be more \"culture-focused\" in their decision-making and have noted Arsenal as an example where cutting ties with players instead of trying to hold out for a fee can help reshape a squad and develop an environment of healthy habits and success.",
      "Sir Dave Brailsford, on United's board and still wading through an audit of the club's football operations, addressed the squad on Monday. He talked them through the INEOS plan of creating an \"ecosystem of excellence\" and how that can only be achieved through total investment from the players, collaborative effort and discipline.",
      "That speech came amid Rashford and his brother/agent Dwaine Maynard meeting with Ten Hag and football director John Murtough, to get a handle on the striker's behaviour.",
      "Rashford means more than most to United, and they have been doing the most to crack the conundrum of what is going on with him. Some at the club feel he just needs a reconfiguring, to be honest with himself about what is truly important and of value to him.",
      "It is interesting to remember what Rashford himself has said about performance less than a year ago. \"Football is probably 95 per cent your mentality. That gives you the baseline to perform. There are a lot of players that have ability - that's why they play at the top level. But what sets them apart is the mentality. I've been on both sides of it.",
      "\"I understand the strength of it and the value. I'm concentrating a lot more on keeping myself in that headspace and it's needed in order to win games and trophies.\"",
      "It is unsurprising that United have sharply moved to draw a line under the misdemeanour. The club have been beset with off-pitch drama in various shapes and at levels of seriousness.",
      "They can ill afford to add another high-profile name and situation to the list. The control for that is out of United's hands though and in Rashford's. He has to show the club, his manager, the supporters and INEOS that he can be trusted.",
      "And that is before his performances even enter the equation. Rashford was in the form of his life last season, top-scoring for United with 30 goals following an inconsistent 18-month stretch hampered by residual shoulder pain.",
      "His return reads four so far this term, in a struggling team desperate for his brilliance when the manager's future and direction of the club is uncertain.",
      "It has been emphasised that if Rashford was still prolific, there would be no fuss over what he was getting up to away from training and matches.",
      "The counter to that is a thread Ten Hag has often stated: what happens on the pitch is a direct result of how you're applying yourself off it. \"I demand the highest standards in sleep, recovery and nutrition because that makes the difference if you can perform every third or fourth day,\" the manager has stated.",
      "He also believes that if you do not respect training in the modern era, you cannot master matches.",
      "Rashford has actually agreed with Ten Hag on this. When he was dropped to the bench against Wolves for arriving late to a team meeting, his assessment was as follows: \"If I was a coach, I'd have done the same. Because if you don't have standards in the training ground, how do you expect to go out on the pitch and win consistently? It's impossible.",
      "\"If you're going to allow each other to slip or have an off day and no one says anything about it … which is at times a position that we've been in.",
      "\"And once you're in it it's difficult to get out of it because it becomes normal and I've not seen it at this club before. It was a little bit strange and it's even more strange when you're involved in it [at Wolves]. So it's constant reminders about discipline.\"",
      "He needs to get his own memos. Rashford will mark eight years in the first team next month. He is in the highest bracket of its earners. Seen as the reference point, it's time to permanently start acting like it again.",

      "It was why Ten Hag went so strong with his team selection and witnessed his side race into a two-goal lead inside the opening quarter of an hour.",
      "Fernandes did his best to remove the romance after seven minutes when receiving a ball from Shaw and finding Antony. The Brazilian played an instant return and Fernandes drilled a shot of rare purity past Nick Townsend within the blink of an eye.",
      "County fans, raucous at kick-off, were silenced and left despairing again as Diogo Dalot motored down the right to set up 18-year-old Mainoo, who carefully caressed his finish into the bottom corner.",
      "Garnacho might have made it worse but rattled the crossbar and Antony drifted in from the right flank to force Townsend to tip over.",
      "But County's recent cup pedigree - wins over Leicester and Leeds, as well as holding Tottenham to a Rodney Parade draw in 2018 - and a seven-game unbeaten run put United on notice they could not expect a smooth ride by the banks of the River Usk.",
      "Newport kept Bayindir honest with efforts from Evans and Ryan Delaney, but Morris' 36th-minute thunderbolt really came out of the blue.",
      "Morris, at Grimsby when the Mariners reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup last season, chested the ball down and unleashed from 25 yards to beat Bayindir with the help of a deflection off Martinez.",
      "Townsend denied Fernandes with the final kick of the first half and the importance of that save was underlined within two minutes of the restart.",
      "Striker Evans, who has gone from milking cows on the family farm to scoring FA Cup goals - will replay what happened next over and over again as his instinctive finish hauled Newport level.",
      "Raphael Varane was caught on his heels at the near post as the man from the Powys family farm - rejected at Shrewsbury - stole a march to finish beyond Bayindir. Evans has tasted European football at two Welsh Premiership clubs but having broken into the EFL, it was a moment he will cherish for the rest of his career.",
      "By now, Newport - 74 places below their visitors in the football pyramid and financial worlds apart - had one of the biggest upsets in the competition's 152-year history in their sights, but United dug deep and found extra resolve to wrestle back control.",
      "Harry Charsley drove wide, but the visitors retook the lead after 68 minutes as Shaw curled on to a post and Antony slotted the rebound.",
      "Harry Maguire was sent on late to preserve United's slender lead before Hojlund extended his scoring streak by pouncing on a loose ball and drilling home.",
      "Sky Sports' Ben Grounds:",
      "FA Cup glory would be a welcome boost for a club that is preparing to go through a big transition under INEOS, who are set to take control of football operations next month.",
      "Incoming minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has a focus on improvements across the board and this competition could provide the platform for under-scrutiny Ten Hag to impress.",
      "United now have a kind-looking fifth-round assignment at either Bristol City or Nottingham Forest, but Ten Hag cannot allow any complacency to seep in.",
      "The return of Luke Shaw, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro looked to have brought a calming influence before the chaos while Altay Bayindir looked assured on his debut. But there were very few tangible positives.",
      "Even Antony needed six attempts to get off the mark for the season and United's troubled season was in danger of sinking to a new low before Hojlund sealed matters in stoppage time.",
      "Ten Hag could almost feel the breath of home supporters standing just yards behind him and while this result does alleviate some of the pressure on him, this result and performance was far from convincing.",
      "Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag told BBC:",
      "\"First 35 minutes it was very comfortable. It should have been 3-0 or 4-0. They created no chance and then out of nothing - I think also it was a foul - they score.",
      "\"Then straight after half-time, a mistake, ours, defensive transition not great. Then you have to start again to win this game. Finally we did, so, boys, well done.\"",
      "Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes told BBC:",
      "\"We wanted to win, we got it. But the result wasn't the perfect one for us.",
      "\"The first one, it's a great goal from them. Unbelievable shot. But after we have to be more focused. In the second half, we can't concede another goal and let them have some belief.",
      "\"We have to kill the game. In the first half, we hand chances to make 3-0 but because when you get 2-0 in these kinds of games everyone wants to try to score and get their goal, sometimes we don't get the best decision for the team.",
      "\"After we did a great job to close the game.",
      "\"Our chance to win a trophy this season is the FA Cup and we have to give everything to get into the final. To make the season look not as bad as it's been, we have to try to win this trophy.\"",
      "Manchester United will now face the winners of the replay between Bristol City and Nottingham Forest in the fifth round.",
      "Swindon Town are next up at Rodney Parade for Newport County in League Two on Saturday February 3.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United play Wolves back in the Premier League on Thursday February 1."

      "The end of Tottenham's bid for a cup success under Ange Postecoglou this season also signals the start of the business end of their Premier League campaign to achieve a top-four finish. While Postecoglou has played down suggestions of a 'target' in his first term in charge, with no cup football Spurs have plenty in their favour to push for Champions League qualification.",
      "Heung-Min Son's absence was felt in that 1-0 defeat to Manchester City, where Spurs uncharacteristically managed just one shot at home. But James Maddison's return from injury brings hope the team can recapture the better form they have shown this year.",
      "It was a chastening comeback for Spurs' creator - Maddison had just six touches during his 18 minutes on the field before Nathan Ake's 88th-minute winner for City - but a role from the start beckons against Brentford on Wednesday.",
      "Two of his five Premier League assists this season came in the opening weekend away game at Brentford and it is fitting his season restarts in earnest against those same opponents. Spurs fans will hope for a similar output from the summer signing who quickly became a key figure at the club before his three months out with an ankle injury.",
      "Tactically, a first pairing with Rodrigo Bentancur intrigues, but with Son still away on international duty, Spurs will be looking for leadership and some magic from Maddison.Peter Smith",
      "Almost imperceptibly, Manchester City, the reigning Premier League, European, and now world champions, have accumulated seven consecutive victories in all competitions. It has become almost trite to note their capacity to 'go on a run' but here we are.",

      "The City head coach said recently that De Bruyne and Haaland do not necessarily help his team to play better football - he has Rodri and Bernardo Silva for that - but they do help his team to win matches. It is all beginning to look a little ominous in the title race.",
      "Ominous sums up the situation for Vincent Kompany as he returns to City with Burnley. Two of their next three after this are against Liverpool and Arsenal but now eight points from safety there are no free hits at this stage. A favour from his old club? Not likely.Adam Bate",
      "The notion you do not win anything with kids has long been quashed and when Liverpool and Chelsea meet in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley next month the point will be underlined.",
      "The academy graduates have been delivering for Liverpool this season. Assists for Conor Bradley (aged 20) and James McConnell (19) against Norwich in the FA Cup on Sunday caught the eye, while Jarell Quansah's (21) assurance at centre-back is almost a given now.",
      "Bobby Clark (18), Kaide Gordon (19) and Owen Beck (21) stepped off the bench in the previous Premier League game at Bournemouth, with the former trusted to help see out the Carabao Cup semi-final tie with Fulham last week. The number of players currently aged 21 or under used by Jurgen Klopp this season is now at a staggering total of 13.",
      "Chelsea are just one behind, with Cole Palmer (21), their standout starlet this term. However, while much has been made of their expensively recruited young players, homegrown Alfie Gilchrist (20) was among their better performers in the FA Cup tie with Aston Villa on Friday night.",

      "A new year and a new start for Kalvin Phillips. After just 31 appearances in two-and-a-half seasons at Manchester City, he will hope to play a major role for West Ham. In fact he could go a long way to matching that number of games in the remainder of this campaign, should he help the Hammers go far in the Europa League.",
      "The new chapter starts at home to Bournemouth on Thursday and in his interviews since his arrival Phillips has looked like a player with renewed enthusiasm for the game and the fresh challenge ahead for him. The encouraging comments from David Moyes about his quality will have boosted his confidence and given him belief he can be a central figure in east London.",
      "It seems like a perfect fit, with the Hammers looking for a player to bring energy and quality on the ball in the middle of the park following Declan Rice's departure.

      "Monday 29 January 2024 15:53, UK",
      "Our tipster Jones Knows' best bets are back from a winter break and ready to punish the bookmakers once more. He is eyeing up a 8/1 treble this midweek.",
      "The best bets column is back from a winter break, fully motivated to get the profit and loss column bouncing in the right direction. This column will live and die by the mantra of \"whatever I tip, I'll be backing - we're in this together\" and my betting activity has grinded to a halt in the last month.",
      "Such was the relentless pace of fixtures over the Christmas period where it was admittedly very difficult to keep up with all the Premier League action while juggling a family, I decided any potential bets advised through the Prediction column didn't quite meet the standards required to officially make it a selection. I then was off for most of January, taking the second half of my paternity leave after the birth of my second child. It was time to concentrate on spending time as a family before Mrs Jones Knows heads back to work.",
      "I don't know how we're going to cope, either.",
      "But for now I've had enough of soft play centres, tantrums, toilet training and being showered by the newborn's reflux tendencies. The Premier League really starts to motor in the next month. There will be angles to attack, big prices to roar home. Shower us with winners, please.",
      "Let's get back to business.",
      "We hit the crossbar with a few of these treble attempts in 2023, so we're due a bit of luck in getting one over the line. All three selections look to have fantastic chances of landing at inflated prices to what my tissue makes them.",
      "Both Fulham and Everton are struggling for inspiration in the final third. Fulham have failed to score in four of their last five Premier League games with their overall goal haul this season very misleading considering 16 of their 28 Premier League goals this season (57 per cent) were scored in a four-game run in November and December. Eight of their last 12 games would have seen both teams to score 'no' backers cop a return while 62 per cent of their Premier League matches this season have also followed that route.",
      "Meanwhile, Everton are the both teams to 'no' kings with 66 per cent of their Premier League matches seeing that particular angle land, including nine of their last 13 games across all competitions.",
      "Luton's corners remain an exciting angle. After winning seven vs Chelsea, they won 11 in the FA Cup third round clash with Bolton before racking up eight at Burnley - it was only the second time in 37 games that Burnley have conceded eight or more corners in a home game under Vincent Kompany. They then went to Bolton for the replay and won nine before racking up seven against Everton on Saturday. The corner aggregate score over those five fixtures reads Luton 42-16 Opposition. They can win five at home to Brighton, no problem.",
      "The treble can be landed by Curtis Jones against Chelsea, where his shots prices look very tasty.",
      "His all-action performances that are proving to be the glue that knits the side together are leading to a huge spike in his attacking output since returning from injury in December, especially at Anfield. In his last five starts in home matches, Jones has had 19 shots, 10 of them on target and scored five goals. He epitomises what this new-look Liverpool are all about.",
      "It's most certainly worth chancing Luton's corner count hitting the higher lines. If they maintain their current 8.4 average over the last five games then the 15/2 on offer for them to win eight or more corners also could look rather big in hindsight.",
