      "Manchester United are weighing up a move for Vanja Milinkovic-Savic as they consider their goalkeeping options. Andre Onana has not inspired and while he's expected to stay is set to have a new back up next season - but Manchester City and Chelsea are also in the running.",
      "The Torino goalkeeper has kept 11 clean sheets for the mid-table Serie A outfit and has caught the eye of some of the Premier League's major sides, reports Tutto Mercato. The goalkeeper’s contract with Torino runs until 2026 and it includes a release clause worth €20million (£16.9m).",
      "United once had Milinkovic-Savic on their books but were unable to sort a work permit out and had to release him as a result. In May 2014, United reached an agreement to sign the goalkeeper from Vojvodina, setting them back just shy of £2million. He remained there on loan for another season but never actually made an appearance for the Red Devils.",
      "Having failed to earn a work permit to play in England Milinkovic-Savic was released in November 2015 and he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with Polish club Lechia Gdansk, before later moving to Italy.",
      "The Serbian has said on his own future: “I have learned that setting goals is not a positive thing, it is better to do things with the lights off. Then in all teams there are replacements of players who are sold and bought, the important thing is to find the right players to strengthen the team.”",
      "Torino's president Urbano Cairo has spoken out and confirmed that no bid has yet been lodged: “He had a great championship and it is normal that he receives a lot of attention, but no offer has arrived yet.”",
      "Onana was signed two years ago by Erik ten Hag as David de Gea's replacement - after the club allowed him to leave at the end of his contract. The Cameroon shotstopper's ability with his feet was seen as a huge bonus, but he's made numerous mistakes that have led to goals in both his seasons in Manchester.",
      "Question marks hang over him in what is a massive summer for Ruben Amorim, who will need to be ruthless if his stint at Old Trafford is a success. The goalkeeper was recently dropped by his coach, but was quickly re-installed as the club's No 1 after less than a week.",
      "Altay Bayindir is expected to depart as he eyes more minutes to further his Turkey ambitions and a return to his homeland is on the cards. Tom Heaton - the club's third choice - has his contract expiring at the end of the season with no decision made on his future but there is an expectation that the veteran stopper could retire."

      "The Premier League have moved Tottenham's clash with Aston Villa forward by two days to give them more time to recover ahead of a potential Europa League final against Manchester United. Spurs were originally scheduled to travel to Villa Park at 2:15pm on Sunday May 18.",
      "Meanwhile, United had been scheduled to play Chelsea away at 8pm on Friday May 16. Should both English clubs successfully navigate the second legs of their semi-final ties, United would've had 42 hours and 15 minutes more rest time compared to Spurs.",
      "Tottenham released a statement on Sunday morning confirming that they were in 'discussions with the Premier League regarding a change in date to our away Premier League match against Aston Villa, currently scheduled for Sunday May 18'. Now the change has been confirmed.",
      "The reason why United and Chelsea were originally moved to play in Friday's fixture slot is because both clubs are involved in the Women's FA Cup final at Wembley on the Sunday. United's men are firm favourites to reach the Europa League final after taking a commanding 3-0 lead from the first leg of their semi-final tie away to Athletic Bilbao last Thursday.",
      "As for Tottenham, it's less straightforward. Ange Postecoglou's side lead Norwegian minnows Bodo/Glimt 3-1 on aggregate but must travel to the Arctic circle for a tricky-looking second leg this Thursday.",
      "There's added pressure because of the fixture change, with the Premier League clearly anticipating an all-English final in Bilbao on Wednesday May 21. Postecoglou was asked about the potential disparity in recovery time ahead of Sunday's 1-1 draw at West Ham.",
      "Will Tottenham reach the Europa League final? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"I haven't looked too deeply into it, I don't know what sort of precedence there is to it,\" the Spurs boss replied. \"I know other leagues do it, which you kind of understand for a European final. I'll leave that to the powers that be and I'll concentrate on trying to get us there first of all.\"",
      "Postecoglou added: \"Bodo are there on merit. They beat Lazio, Olympiakos; they're tough teams. I'm from the other side of the world. It doesn't matter where you're from. We're going to treat them with the respect they deserve and give our best.",
      "\"Missing Patrick Berg is a loss for them but I think it's always been more about what they do as a team rather than individuals. They've sold a lot of players over the past five years but they've kept doing well.\""

The French international kept her composure to slot past Khiara Keating and spark the home fans at the Stretford End into wild celebration.",

      "Catarina Macario's first-half penalty fired title winners Chelsea past Tottenham Hotspur and left them on the brink of completing an unbeaten season. Macario was brought down in the box just after the half-hour mark and duly sent Lize Kop the wrong way with her spot kick.",

Down the other end of the pitch, Maika Hamano saw her long-range effort stopped by Kop before firing a strike over the crossbar after Macario threaded the ball into the Japanese's path.",

      "The crucial result moves them to within a point of fifth-placed Villarreal, who occupy the final Champions League spot in LaLiga. Antony's curling strike from outside the penalty area made it two goals in his last two appearances, having also netted in Thursday's Conference League semi-final first leg at home to Fiorentina.",
      "Antony joined Betis until the end of the season in January and has impressed so much that the Spanish side want to sign him permanently. There've even been reports that LaLiga giants Atletico Madrid have contacted United to discuss a move in the region of £34million.",
      "Goals like his strike on Sunday will do him no harm, as he looks a different player to the one who failed miserably at Old Trafford. Antony failed to live up to his £86m price tag during two-and-a-half tumultuous years at United, where he eventually found himself out of favour under new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "But the Brazilian has clicked with former Manchester City boss Pellegrini, whose full support has left Antony feeling 'grateful'. \"It's very important because I've said in many interviews that I've found myself because I'm happy, things are going well,\" he told Movistar Plus post-match.",
      "\"The coach joked with me because I scored great goals with my right foot, but he asked me when I'd do it with my left foot. I gave him a hug after scoring because he's someone I care deeply about and I'm grateful for his trust.\"",
      "The winger, who now has seven goals and four assists in 20 games for Betis, also said: \"Very happy with the win, with the amazing goal at the end of the match. We knew it would be very difficult, and now we can enjoy the victory because it's very important.\"",
      "Betis chief executive Ramon Alarcon has said the club are 'cautiously optimistic' about the prospect of keeping Antony in Seville beyond the summer. Alarcon told Canal Sur: \"When we spoke about the possibility to bring Antony in January, I saw it more distant than I see now him staying.",
      "\"It's because both Manchester United and the player have seen that Real Betis is a great place for the player to develop. Right now I'm more optimistic than in January.\"",
      "The Betis CEO added: \"It's going to be difficult because he is a player owned by Manchester with financial conditions that are what they are. I am cautiously optimistic.\""

Alexander-Arnold is happy on Merseyside, yet wants to move to Spain to challenge himself.",

      "The 24-year-old has played for Leverkusen for the past four years, but started out in the Manchester City academy. However, explaining his journey as a youngster, he said he would have preferred to join Liverpool instead.",
      "“One time with AFC Clayton, we had a final. I scored a hat-trick and won player of the tournament,\" he told Rising Ballers. \"There were scouts from Liverpool, Man City, Bolton and lots more. I chose Liverpool first. I was going to sign for them but back then, driving wasn’t a thing. My family wasn’t driving and it was far. Man City was local so I tried Man City next. It made more sense. It was 15 minutes on the bus.”",
      "Mikel Arteta has been told by Jamie O'Hara that he should be doing whatever he can to persuade Kevin De Bruyne to swap Man City for Arsenal when he departs the Etihad at the end of the season.",
      "The former Wolfsburg man has already been linked with clubs in the United States but he has also refused to rule out playing for another team in England.",
      "And O'Hara says that pursuing a deal for the player who has been City's orchestrator-in-chief during a period of sustained success is a no-brainer for an Arsenal side who have failed to win the Premier League title in successive years.",

      "With Thursday’s Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Bilbao the clear priority, Amorim named the third youngest Premier League starting XI of any club. Youngsters Chido Obi-Martin, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson were all handed opportunities but did not impress.",
      "However, United legend Rooney was more critical of Amorim and the more experienced players who were out there. Speaking on Match of the Day 2, he called out Kobbie Mainoo for “switching off” for two of Brentford’s goals and Amorim for fielding substitute Amad Diallo out of position at right wingback and for putting a “disjointed” team together which put “no pressure on the ball” and lacked intensity.",
      "Expanding on Rooney’s points, ex-Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy said: “It is about intensity, but with wingbacks, different to a back four, it allows you to go and press because you’ve got the extra centre half behind you.",
      "“But surely that’s what they do in training, no? If you’re a coach of a system – the basics of this system with wingbacks is they press the wide men quick and it doesn’t look like they’re doing it. It’s bizarre for me to see.”",
      "Rooney replied: “It’s strange, because that’s why you play a back five with wingbacks. They have to put pressure on the ball or otherwise you get outnumbered in the midfield and the ball comes back into midfield. It was strange, but they had a lot of young players.”",
      "“There was a lack of movement and a lack of knowhow on the pitch,” he added. “They’ve got a 17-year-old lad up front – the youngest ever to start up front for United – and they’re just launching balls up to him. I really felt for Obi today because you can tell he’s inexperienced but it looked like he had no help, they were just throwing balls up to him.”",
      "Murphy added: “I get that there’s young players, I understand that and they’re playing against good teams. But he (Amorim) only plays one system, he’s not mixing things up, personnel and system and he’s been there a while now. When you play a system that much and you work on it in training, surely we can see more improvement, irrelevant of who is playing because they should be organised in that system.”",
      "Rooney responded: “You’d think so, but I think the second team are playing a back four, which I found strange, because those players who are coming into the first team now with the under-23s or under-21s are playing a different system.",
      "\"For me, that’s a bit confusing. Getting to the Europa League final is papering over a lot of cracks for Manchester United and that needs solving quickly.”"

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has doubled down on his claim that United made a huge blunder by selling Scott McTominay. The Red Devils academy was allowed quit Old Trafford last summer and headed to Italy with Napoli. He cost the Serie A leaders £21m and the midfielder has gone on to be an inspired signing - scoring 12 times as he eyes a title triumph.",
      "McTominay was a favourite under Solskjaer throughout his time in charge in Manchester and he often stuck by the Scot, despite calls for him to drop the player in favour of an upgrade. Now the decision to let him go looks a shocker and the former United boss is stunned.",
      "He told the BBC : \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\""

      "It took Ruben Amorim just one training session at Carrington to decide that Mason Mount was a player with a future under him at Manchester United. After a disappointing first season at the club following his £60million move from Chelsea, a change of manager looked set to be a turning point for Mount.",
      "Since then, the compliments have rarely stopped, but on the pitch, the story has barely changed. Mount had gone five months without a start until playing - and scoring - against Brentford on Sunday. Even then, he lasted less than an hour despite being one of United's most dangerous attacking players.",
      "In his first interview with club media after becoming United's head coach, Amorim was waxing lyrical about Mount and what he had seen from the 36-cap England international in his first two weeks.",
      "“Mason Mount… I have to tell you I love that kid,” he said. “You can look in his eyes that he wants this so bad. And this is the most important thing for me.",
      "“I know he was suffering from injuries, he was not on the pitch, but now he’s trying to stay fit and we hope he can continue to be fit, to show all the talent that he’s shown, for example, in Chelsea.”",
      "Staying fit has again proven to be the hardest part for Mount. The 26-year-old was making progress under Amorim, and when he started the Manchester derby on December 15, it looked like he had finally broken back into the starting XI. However, he lasted just 14 minutes before limping off with a hamstring injury.",
      "That injury once again robbed him of momentum, and after returning to match action on April 1, it took eight substitute appearances before he was handed a start at the Gtech Community Stadium in a match as meaningless as they come in the Premier League, although for Mount there was plenty on the line.",
      "He took his goal superbly and could have had another before his surprise withdrawal early in the second half.",
      "\"It’s not just the finish, it’s the position that he has on the pitch, he’s like a third midfielder who can reach the box, he’s really intelligent, so he’s getting there,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"And he trains really hard, sometimes I have to push him back, take him out of the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We have to take care of him, I’m really happy with him.\"",
      "United have certainly been cautious with Mount's return from a second hamstring injury this season. His injury record at Chelsea was excellent, so there will be understandable concern that he has now suffered a few separate muscle injuries at Old Trafford.",
      "There will be hope that he can get through the rest of this season and then a full pre-season, when Amorim is likely to work his players hard to improve their fitness and physical limits ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "But it is likely to remain the case that, as much as Amorim likes Mount, he is going to find it hard to get him into his strongest XI. He could operate in one of those No. 10 roles in the three remaining Premier League games this term, but there seems little prospect of him breaking into the Europa League team.",
      "Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have formed a good partnership at the base of midfield, which has seen Bruno Fernandes moved forward to partner Alejandro Garnacho as a No. 10. None of that quarter appear droppable either for Thursday's second leg against Athletic Club or a potential final back in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "There is further competition for those attacking roles with the return of Amad to fitness, although he could be used at wing-back, while Kobbie Mainoo has also been used there by Amorim. Next season might see Fernandes dropped deeper on a permanent basis, or Mainoo turned into a permanent No. 6, but United's interest in Matheus Cunha shows a desire to add another attacking midfielder.",
      "Then there is Amad to consider, who could stand in for Diogo Dalot this season but also appears to be a No. 10 in Amorim's long-term planning. That is a lot of competition for Mount.",
      "Amorim isn't the first coach to praise Mount's intelligence. He is a player coaches love to work with, and he can certainly offer this United team something. But finding a role for him in the strongest XI could be a step too far."

      "Ruben Amorim's appointment as head coach back in November risked sending a shiver down the spines of one or two Manchester United players.",
      "Following their decision to axe Erik ten Hag, United earmarked Amorim as their first-choice target to replace the Dutchman, moving swiftly to extract him from the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon.",
      "United identified the 40-year-old as their top target because they felt he was the ideal candidate to bring a clear identity to Old Trafford. He had overseen his fair share of success at Sporting Lisbon, inspired by his trademark 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim's three-at-the-back system had the capacity to bring something fresh to Old Trafford. Nevertheless, the new system has brought with it some teething problems.",
      "The biggest change generated by United moving to a three-man defence was the eradication of wide roles for natural wingers. Amorim's system is built on width being provided by athletic wing-backs, who are equally comfortable when defending and attacking.",
      "That meant Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Amad would have no doubt been left pondering where and how they would fit into Amorim's plans. Rashford and Antony, of course, were sent out on loan in January, but both Garnacho and Amad have been central to Amorim's thinking since his appointment.",
      "Garnacho was one of just three players to keep his place in the starting XI for Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Brentford from the 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao less than 72 hours earlier and he rewarded Amorim's thinking by scoring his 11th goal of the season and providing an assist.",
      "His second half curler, which was nothing more than a consolation effort, ensured this season will mark his most profitable in front of goal of his career so far, with his strike against Brentford taking him one clear of last season's return of ten.",
      "Garnacho has played 54 games this season, with his omission from the squad for the Manchester derby victory over City at the Etihad Stadium in December marking the only game he has not appeared in across all competitions. Playing 36 times since Amorim's appointment, no player in a United shirt has made more appearances under the Portuguese chief.",
      "For a time, it appeared as though Garnacho was struggling to get to grips with Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system after being tasked with playing as a No.10 and not a natural winger. The Argentine's game is based on getting on the ball out wide, beating his man and attempting to make something happen.",
      "Following the introduction of wing-backs, however, he has had to adapt his game and learn to occupy spaces inside the pitch, with the wing-backs responsible for bombing forward on the outside and providing width.",
      "As a playmaker, Garnacho is playing more centrally than he has previously in his career, but he has shown signs that he is beginning to understand exactly what it is Amorim is asking of him in that position, with his return of three goals and four assists since the start of March offering evidence to suggest he is moving in the right direction.",
      "Of course, a return of seven direct goal contributions in 14 games is not exactly a jaw-dropping figure, but it is far from disappointing for a player still getting to grips with a new role. It also shouldn't be forgotten that he is still only 20.",
      "Amorim said back in January he was pleased with the way Garnacho was adjusting to life as a No.10, but that he still needed to \"play better\".",
      "\"That is clear, he has talent,\" said Amorim. \"He needs to learn to play a little bit in a different position. He needs to play better inside.",
      "\"He improved a lot in the recovering position, when he doesn't have the ball, but, doing that, sometimes he's not in the right place to make transitions, like he was in the past, because I prefer to defend and then build up with all the team to make the final third.",
      "\"So he's finding the best way to play in this system. He's improving during training.\"",
      "Over the last few weeks, whether it be as the right-sided No.10 or the left-sided No.10, Garnacho's performances have improved, and his run of eight successive Premier League starts would suggest Amorim agrees.",
      "Garnacho's long-term future at Old Trafford remains to be determined amid interest from elsewhere, but his recent performances have shown he can have a long-term part to play in Amorim's plans."

This would be a first European title of his career, having come desperately close more than a decade ago.",

      "Over the weekend, former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was the latest high-profile figure to question the awarding of a Champions League spot to the Europa League winners.",
      "Asked if it is right that the Europa League winner qualifies for the Champions League, Wenger told beIN Sports, said: \"No. Well, it is right if you make the decision [for the Europa League winner to get Champions League qualification].",
      "\"They should qualify automatically for the Europa League again, not necessarily for the Champions League. Especially when you're in a league where you already have too many teams, five teams, qualify.",

Of course it is the most important because it is the next one, because it is a big game as well.",
      "\"It influences the future of my club and that is why it is massive. It is a very, very big for us because the future of Arsenal Football Club is not exactly the same if we qualify for the Champions League or not.\"",

      "Only four teams who have been in the Premier League since the start of 2023/24 have lost 30 games or more, with Tottenham Hotspur (31), Brentford (32) and Wolves (36) joining United in that group.",
      "That is an indefensible record and one that everybody associated with United should be striving to improve next season. Of course, United's season is still very much alive in the Europa League, and winning that competition would bank Amorim a lot of credit, but an improved Premier League record next season must be United's main aim.",
      "United's supporters have witnessed two more defeats than they have victories in the league since the start of last season.",
      "Winning the Europa League, securing Champions League qualification for 2025/26 and securing an improved budget will improve Amorim's chances of correcting United's domestic woes and improve his squad at a quicker pace.",
      "The last two Premier League campaigns have been complete write-offs, but there are reasons for United to be optimistic ahead of next season."

      "During Liverpool’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United in January, Keane singled out Alexander-Arnold for criticism, suggesting he looked better suited to playing for Tranmere Rovers. The England international was caught out twice in the first half, leading Keane to comment at half-time.",
      "\"They're talking about him going to Real Madrid, the way he's defending, he's going to Tranmere Rovers after this. He doesn't have to move house then, does he? But he's got to do better defensively, he's got to do better.\"",
      "On Monday morning, after Liverpool's 3-1 defeat to Chelsea, Alexander-Arnold announced he would be departing his boyhood club after 20 years. His contract will expire at the end of June.",
      "In a video, he said: \"After 20 years at Liverpool Football Club, now is the time for me to confirm that I will be leaving at the end of the season. This is easily the hardest decision I’ve ever made in my life. I know many of you have wondered why or been frustrated that I haven’t spoken about this yet, but it was always my intention to keep my full focus on the team’s best interests, which was securing No.20. This club has been my whole life – my whole world - for 20 years.",
      "\"From the Academy right through until now, the support and love I have felt from everyone inside and outside of the club will stay with me forever. I will forever be in debt to you all. But, I have never known anything else and this decision is about experiencing a new challenge, taking myself out of my comfort zone and pushing myself both professionally and personally.",

From the bottom of my heart, I thank everybody – my coaches, my managers, my teammates, the staff and our incredible supporters - for the last 20 years. I’ve been blessed enough to live out my dreams here and I will never, ever take for granted the special moments I’ve been fortunate enough to have lived through with you all. My love for this club will never die.\"",

      "Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure, however, could be a serious blow to Arne Slot's team. The versatile right-back has his flaws, particularly when it comes to concentration, but make no mistake that Liverpool have lost a generational talent and that will sting.",
      "The fact that he is also departing Anfield on a free transfer will only make it more painful for United's great rivals. As an academy graduate, any transfer fee received would have gone down as pure profit on Liverpool's balance sheet. Due to the league's profit and sustainability rules (PSR), pure profit is like gold dust for Premier League clubs.",
      "Instead, they are watching on helplessly as one of their prized assets walks away for nothing. Now, any hope of a huge rebuild on Merseyside will be ever so slightly dampened, with less PSR wriggle room to work with.",
      "Liverpool's lack of heavy expenditure last summer will help them, of course, as will success on the pitch, which will boost their financial position. But it is vital for United and other top-flight teams that Slot's men do not pull even further into the distance.",
      "It now feels likely that Liverpool will win a converted record 21st league title before United. No one needs to tell fans at Old Trafford that Ruben Amorim's side are light years away from their most hated rivals.",
      "And yet things can change quickly in football. What if Amorim's men win this season's Europa League and, more importantly, seal a lucrative place in next season's Champions League?",
      "United would finally see some light at the end of the tunnel and a path towards a much-needed rebuild. Of course, no one is suggesting that the Reds would then be able to go and challenge for Premier League glory next term. Amorim himself has acknowledged this after they suffered their 16th league defeat of an abysmal campaign on Sunday at Brentford.",
      "But United themselves know how hard it is to get recruitment right. All it takes is for Liverpool to have one or two bad transfer windows for that gap to narrow - if United can get their own house in order, of course.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold's exit from Anfield may not stop Slot's side from winning more silverware next season. It does, however, weaken their PSR position and lead to questions over how they will replace a player who has undeniably had a huge impact on Merseyside over the last several years."

      "With Trent Alexander-Arnold confirming his exit from Liverpool this summer, we looked at the most valuable of all free transfers.",
      "There’s no Sol Campbell on here because it happened in the before-times, but here’s a list of every club’s biggest free transfer regret if that’s more your bag.",
      "",
      "10) Youri Tielemans (Leicester City to Aston Villa)\n“From the first day I set foot on this ground, your warmth and passion embraced me. Victory and triumph, love, hope and even defeat,” wrote the Belgian midfielder as he confirmed what we had all long knew: He would leave a relegated Leicester City with an FA Cup winner’s medal and the knowledge that he could have done little more to stop the slide from two consecutive top-five finishes to relegation.",
      "In truth, his final year at Leicester was poor after a failed transfer to Arsenal left him ‘mentally gone’. We expected Arsenal to return when he became available on a free transfer in 2023 – it really did feel like a no-brainer – but it was Aston Villa who won that particular race. “The manager was selling me this idea of playing Champions League and I really bought into it,” said Tielemans, who would be playing in Europe’s elite competition a year later.",
      "After a tricky first season in Villa colours, he has since thrived in the Champions League and Premier League, where he has made a good case for making the Premier League XI of the season.",
      "READ: Alexander-Arnold joins list of every Premier League club’s biggest free transfer exit",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (Manchester United to PSG)\nThe Spanish midfielder was reduced to tears on a Manchester United podcast when discussing his exit from the club: “I got the Player of the Year award by the fans and the club didn’t call me that summer to sign a new contract, and they did with other players. That was painful for me, honestly.”",
      "Herrera won the individual gong on the back of United’s most successful post-Sir Alex Ferguson season, in which he played a key role in their League Cup and Europa League titles, and memorably man-marked Eden Hazard out of a clash with Chelsea in perhaps the defining game of his United career.",
      "But the new contract did not arrive that summer and a lame offer as his deal came to a close was comfortably improved by PSG. “There is red in my heart,” said Herrera as he confirmed his departure.",
      "He ranks pretty high in a (largely awful) list of Manchester United transfers post-Fergie.",
      "",
      "8) Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City to…)\n“I don’t know about the future unfortunately. I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don’t do what I do these last four or five weeks,” said Kevin De Bruyne after striking the only goal as Manchester City beat Wolves, taking him to 250 goal involvements under Pep Guardiola.",
      "He has won six Premier Leagues, one Champions League and seven domestic cups (an eighth could come in the FA Cup this month) for City, making him one of the most decorated players in Premier League history.",
      "The Belgian is clearly very upset not to be offered terms by City, meaning his 10-year reign as one of the best midfielders in Premier League history is coming to an end. Or is it? His form in the final weeks of his City stay has prompted some cheeky links with Liverpool, while Aston Villa are said to be very interested.",
      "“Let’s talk about the statue – for me he is Manchester City’s greatest ever player,” said Jamie Carragher. Would the club still build him a statue if he stays in the Premier League? They would probably quite like him to slink over to the semi-retirement of MLS.",
      "",
      "7) Gini Wijnaldum (Liverpool to PSG)\n“What this person – this wonderful, joyful, selfless person – has done for our team and club I cannot sum up in words, in truth, because my English is not good enough,” said Jurgen Klopp as Wijnaldum played his 237th and final game for Liverpool.",
      "The Dutchman had barely stopped running in five years at Anfield which earned him Premier League and Champions League medals, but he fell victim of FSG’s reluctance to hand long contracts to players in their 30s. He wanted to stay and Klopp wanted to keep him – he was ‘perfect’ for Klopp’s system – but a business decision was made.",
      "It seemed that Barcelona would sign Wijnaldum – they are masters of the free transfer swoop – but PSG stepped in to offer twice the money. There he won a French league title but being wonderful, joyful and selfless buttered no parsnips in Paris and he is now in Saudi Arabia playing as a striker.",
      "",
      "6) Emre Can (Liverpool to Juventus)\nIt’s been seven years since we said the free transfer exit of Emre Can from Liverpool should be met with ‘shrugs’, and we were absolutely right. As galling as it always is to allow a player worth £30m-plus to leave for nothing, he was never integral to a Liverpool side building towards Champions League and Premier League glory under Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It helps of course that he was then pretty poor at Juventus (though his career has since been rescued by Borussia Dortmund) while Liverpool brought in Fabinho and immediately won the Champions League. Can was never missed.",
      "",
      "5) Andreas Christensen (Chelsea to Barcelona)\n“Having spent ten amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family,” said the Dane, not so fondly remembered by Chelsea fans after he made himself unavailable to play in the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2022. The decision to leave had clearly affected the form of a player who had won the Champions League the year before.",
      "There was enmity between club and player at the end, with Christensen blamed for twice reportedly reneging on verbal agreements to sign a new contract. He then engaged new agents who wanted to start the whole process again from scratch.",
      "He won the title with Barcelona in his very first season but has been perpetually linked with a return to the Premier League, with the Spanish club likely to accept slightly less than his £430m buy-out clause.",
      "",
      "4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea to Real Madrid)\nIn the same summer that Christensen left, Rudiger also departed Chelsea. And the Blues have been struggling for leadership at the back ever since; they have won nothing since the German left in 2021.",
      "Rudiger admitted that the uncertainty surrounding Chelsea’s ownership and the knock-on effect on player negotiations were a big factor in his exit, saying: “For me, there was a gap between August and January, and that made me think “what’s going on”.",
      "“You get pressure from other teams because it’s January and people don’t know what’s happening and you would have to wait until June because you have a contender to take over the club but even today you cannot talk to him because you have to go through Government stuff and everything.",
      "“I didn’t want to wait until June to sort out my future because it’s been almost a year of uncertainty.”",
      "And nobody can begrudge anybody joining Real Madrid, right?",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal to Juventus)\n“It all happened…I agreed to a contract they proposed,” said Ramsey when attempting to explain why he had left Arsenal after 11 years at the club. He claims that the offer was then retracted as manager Unai Emery decided he wanted to take the club in a different direction.",
      "A few months later Emery was sacked by Arsenal and Ramsey has signed a deal with Juventus that gave him the highest basic salary of any British footballer. But there were few regrets from Arsenal as he never started more than 13 Serie A games in a season for the Italian giants (though he did win a Serie A title) before a loan spell at Rangers and a permanent exit to Nice and then Cardiff.",
      "",
      "2) Paul Pogba (Manchester United to Juventus)\nOnly Manchester United could twice spend money on a mercurial talent and twice watch him walk away for nothing.",
      "‘For a boy that joined the academy at 16 to make over 200 United appearances and lift the Youth Cup, along with two major pieces of silverware, is something that should be applauded and celebrated,’ said Manchester United in a statement that somehow missed out the details of Pogba being allowed to walk away for nothing, re-join for £89m and then leave for nothing again six years later.",
      "Relations between Pogba and the club had long since broken down but the second that Jose Mourinho referred to Pogba as a “virus” should have been the second they began plans to sell him and recoup some of their costs.",
      "He later said that he wanted to leave in the summer of 2019 after his best season for Manchester United because he saw the writing on the wall about the direction of travel but the club denied him an exit; they would live to regret their reticence.",
      "",
      "1) Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool to, we presume, Real Madrid)\nOnly perhaps Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi have been more valuable free transfers. He has chosen adventure over comfort after winning everything at Liverpool.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly looking to get Trent Alexander-Arnold out of his Liverpool contract early in order for him to play at the FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "Some Liverpool fans are absolutely seething about Trent leaving; others are embarrassed by that small-time reaction.",
      "Jamie Carragher thinks Trent Alexander-Arnold’s move from Liverpool to Real Madrid will spark ‘simmering resentment’ from fans.",
      "Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is set to complete a move to Real Madrid in the summer on a free transfer, according to widespread reports.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly attempting to persuade Barcelona to do business for Jules Kounde in the summer as they look to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold is leaving Anfield because of the one thing the Reds can’t give him over Real Madrid, according to reports."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 12 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.2\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remain in sniffing distance of a European place.",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.3% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.6\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "6) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "10) Alisson (Liverpool): +1.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled.",
      "",
      "12) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.9\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "13) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.8\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",
      "",
      "14) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "15) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.8\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -0.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Jordan Pickford this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -2.5\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",
      "",
      "19) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -3.1\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",
      "",
      "20) Jose Sa (Wolves): -3.1\nSaved a penalty v Leicester City to keep his seventh clean sheet of the season.",
      "",
      "21) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -4.5\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "22) Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): -5.7\nConceded 15 goals in six games and the numbers suggest he should have conceded around 11 goals. It’s been a pattern all season. But he was far better v Newcastle.",
      "Man Utd have made an ‘offer’ for Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Jan Oblak with the Red Devils looking to sell Andre Onana this summer, according to reports.",
      "Andre Onana is reportedly ‘open to leaving’ Man Utd in the summer transfer window and there is already one club that is in ‘major’ talks to sign him.",

      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "Man Utd and Spurs are languishing in 15th and 16th place respectively in the Premier League, but convincing first-leg wins in their Europa League semi-finals — 3-0 over Athletic Club for Utd and 3-1 over Bodo/Glimt for Spurs — have put them in pole position to set up a winner-takes-all final in Bilbao later this month.",
      "Current UEFA rules grant the Europa League winners automatic entry to the following season’s Champions League, regardless of domestic league performance.",
      "But Wenger, the pantomime villain of so many Arsenal and Utd encounters during his 22-year reign as Gunners boss, is not convinced that such a backdoor route is fair.",
      "“No. They should qualify automatically for the Europa League again, but not necessarily for the Champions League.",
      "“Especially when you’re in the Premier League, where already five teams qualify. I think it’s something [for UEFA] to think about and to review.",
      "“On the other hand, people will tell you that to keep the Europa League focused, interesting and motivated, you need to give them that prize.”",

      "“I don’t believe so.",
      "“It will make the difference between the top teams in England and the rest of Europe even bigger, because you would say only a few teams now can compete with the Premier League teams in the Champions League.",
      "“It can be Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and then, financially, you’re already at the end basically.”",
      "This wouldn’t be the first time Man Utd have relied on the Europa League to save a disappointing season. In 2016/17, they won the competition under Jose Mourinho despite finishing sixth in the Premier League.",
      "If Utd can repeat that feat this season, or if Spurs can end a 41-year European trophy drought, then the Premier League sides will record a bit of history.",
      "No club finishing lower than 12th in the Premier League has qualified for the Champions League via the Europa League since the tournament’s rebrand in 2009.",
      "Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has given his view on whether the Gunners can beat Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League semi-final.",

      "Man Utd have been linked with a move for Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo along with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Red Devils have had a miserable season in the Premier League with Ruben Amorim’s side currently 15th heading into the final three matches of the campaign.",
      "Amorim’s men are already guaranteed to finish the season as the worst Man Utd team to have played in the Premier League, even if they win their remaining three fixtures.",

      "And now Man Utd want to support him in the transfer window with a number of signings and one of the main areas they want to improve is in attack.",
      "On Sunday, the Daily Telegraph reported that Brentford winger Mbeumo is now a ‘target’ for Man Utd ‘as well as’ Wolves Cunha as they look to overhaul their front line.",
      "The Brentford man is ‘high on list of potential targets as Amorim looks to bolster squad’ and Man Utd are ‘ready to join the race’ for Mbeumo ‘when competition for the £60 million-rated Brentford forward intensifies during the summer transfer window’.",
      "The report added:",

So, of course, if the right price – and that’s going to be expensive – is coming, then I’m sure the club will be open for it. But I’m very happy he’s here, and I’m convinced that Bryan will still be happy playing football here.”",

      "Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano says there is a “clear feeling” that Christopher Nkunku will “leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window.”",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, Romano revealed that Nkunku was a genuine candidate to leave in January.",
      "However, a move never came close due to Chelsea’s reluctance to accept a loan and the player’s preference for a permanent deal.",
      "“There was a possibility for Christopher Nkunku to go on a permanent transfer in January,” Romano said. “Then all the approaches were for a loan deal, and Nkunku was not keen for a loan. Same for the club.”",
      "Romano also revealed that Man Utd, managed by Ruben Amorim, explored a potential swap deal during the winter window, but talks never progressed.",
      "“There was some interest from Bayern in January, some interest also from Manchester United, but only in case of a swap deal, and nothing happened,” he said.",
      "With Chelsea now under Enzo Maresca and preparing for another summer overhaul, Romano believes there’s now a clear path for Nkunku to depart.",
      "Surprise reports linking him with a move to champions Liverpool emerged last week.",
      "“The story for Christopher Nkunku will be different [this summer]… the clear feeling of all parties involved is for Christopher Nkunku to leave Chelsea in the summer transfer window,” he said.",
      "Nkunku, who joined from RB Leipzig in 2023 for over £50m, has struggled to find form or fitness since arriving in West London. Having missed large chunks of his first season at the club, the Frenchman has struggled to find regular minutes this term, scoring just three goals in 27 Premier League appearances.",

      "“Nkunku is not finding the space he wants,” Romano explained.",
      "“Also, probably in terms of skills, Nkunku is not exactly the kind of player needed for Enzo Maresca’s vision and idea. Nkunku wants to play on a regular basis, and at Chelsea, this is not happening.",
      "“Apart from the Conference League. But it’s about Premier League football, the crucial games, and Nkunku wants to play.”",
      "Romano also confirmed Nkunku has picked up yet another injury and will miss the next 10 to 15 days, further fuelling expectations of a summer exit.",
      "“My expectation is not to see Christopher Nkunku in a Chelsea shirt next season.",
      "“I told you that in March and in April, and I confirm that also now in May.”",
      "Chelsea are understood to be open to offers and would prefer a permanent transfer over another season of uncertainty. Clubs in Germany, Italy and Spain are also said to be monitoring the situation.",
      "It remains to be seen if Utd are open to returning for Nkunku when the window opens on June 1, but their January preference for a swap deal hints at the financial restrictions the club may have to work around.",

      "20) Marco Verratti (Al-Arabi)\nTwo years might well be enough for a mid-table Qatari side; will he join a really good Qatari side instead?",
      "",
      "19) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",
      "",
      "18) Josh Brownhill (Burnley)\nThere are links to a West Ham move that sound like the most West Ham move ever.",
      "",
      "17) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, he will surely stay for a Premier League campaign.",
      "",
      "16) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026.",
      "",
      "15) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",
      "",
      "14) Thomas Partey (Arsenal)\nArsenal have opened contract talks with the Ghanaian but he has attracted interest from Atletico Madrid.",
      "",
      "13) Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)\nHe has more than served his dues and a whole host of mid-table Premier League sides should be interested after he exits the club following a second inevitable relegation.",
      "",
      "12) Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)\nSurely retirement will beckon at 38. Unless he thinks he has another World Cup in him…",
      "",
      "11) Ola Aina (Nottingham Forest)\nSurely only a matter of time before Forest tie him down. “I hope so, I really enjoy it here. I enjoy the staff, the players, the club, the community. Everything about it is a good place, so, yeah, hopefully,” he said.",
      "",
      "10) Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nInitially reluctant to commit himself to the unstable Toffees and will likely have his pick of mid-table Premier League clubs on a free transfer. Tottenham are said to be very predictably interested.",
      "",
      "9) Angel Gomes (Lille)\nThe Lee Carsley England call-up has been linked with a free transfer move back to England but West Ham do not appeal. There has been talk of Roma.",
      "",
      "8) Olivier Boscagli (PSV)\nBrighton were linked with a move for defender Boscagli this summer, while Inter have busied themselves laying down foundations for their approach once his PSV contract expires in the summer.",
      "",
      "7) Tyrick Mitchell (Crystal Palace)\nPalace are reportedly keen to open contract talks with Oliver Glasner’s first-choice left-back. He will expect an increase on his reported £40,00-a-week wages.",
      "",
      "6) Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nThe departure has already been announced for perhaps Manchester City’s greatest player. MLS seems a likely next career move, though there is some cheeky talk of Liverpool.",
      "",
      "5) Frank Anguissa (Napoli)\nHaving been a regular for Napoli in the two seasons since he joined, Anguissa might expect his terms to be extended. But it also might depend on the mood of Antonio Conte on any given day. Both Manchester City and United have been linked.",
      "",
      "4) Jonathan Tah (Bayer Leverkusen)\nDid appear to be bound for Bayern Munich until Bayer Leverkusen insisted they wanted over £35m for the German international. Barcelona are among those linked. Because of course they are. And now Real Madrid are said to be interested too.",
      "",
      "3) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nThe talk from Munich was that Bayern would not make Sane a new contract offer until March/April because his performances lacked consistency. And he’s since been named Bayern Player of the Month for March; a contract announcement is imminent.",
      "",
      "2) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool?",
      "",
      "1) Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)\nWhile Salah and Van Dijk have opted to stay, Trent Alexander-Arnold has confirmed that he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season. He hasn’t said he is going to Real Madrid, but we know he is going to Real Madrid.",

As you can imagine, the Anfield faithful have reacted in a completely normal way and they wish their academy graduate – who has won everything with them – nothing but the best.",

      "",
      "Arsenal: Aaron Ramsey\nIf we did not restrict it to Bosman transfers, there would be a plethora of options for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil, ex-captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and club-record signing at the time Nicolas Pepe all had their contracts terminated, but did not leave on a Jean-Marc.",
      "Ramsey leaving was disappointing but nobody could blame him; the wages Juventus offered him were extraordinary and only a fool would have said no, especially taking into account it is a huge European club he was joining. It’s a shame it didn’t work a hero in two FA Cup finals.",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Thomas Hitzlsperger\nRon Vlaar, Brad Friedel, Nigel Reo-Coker and Mark Bosnich were all considered but a wise man once told me, ‘If in doubt, go for Der Hammer’.",
      "The midfielder returned to Germany with Stuttgart following the expiry of his Villa contract in 2005. He did come back to England, signing for West Ham in July 2010 and spending the majority of 2012/13 at Everton.",

      "Bournemouth: Jefferson Lerma\nLloyd Kelly might have prevailed through recency bias but Lerma’s departure was hardly ideal for Bournemouth in their preparation for returning to the top flight.",

      "Brentford: Christian Eriksen\nIt doesn’t matter that there are barely any options for Brentford because Eriksen is the clear winner.",
      "The ex-Tottenham Hotspur playmaker had to leave Serie A after his cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 and Brentford offered him a return to the Premier League, which was perfect in every way. The large Danish contingent would have helped Eriksen settle back into a competitive setting and the Bees were nowhere near bad enough for Eriksen to snub them and not good enough for there to be any chance of making him look out of his depth.",
      "Despite wanting to keep him beyond the six-month contract he signed in January 2022, Brentford could not convince Eriksen to sign and the midfielder went to Manchester United.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Jose Izquierdo\nEnock Mwepu obviously does not count but is worth a mention considering the horrendous circumstances that ended his career while at Brighton.",
      "Albion were a tricky one but we are pretty content with Izquierdo’s inclusion. What a throwback that is, by the way.",
      "Davy Propper was originally our first choice but no Bosman means no inclusion. It threw a spanner in the works when it became clear he was still under contract when he left.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Antonio Rudiger\nThiago Silva, Andreas Christensen, Willian, Joe Cole, Michael Ballack, N’Golo Kante, Hernan Crespo, Nicolas Anelka, Andriy Shevchenko… Chelsea are comfortably the club with the most options.",
      "Losing a prime Antonio Rudiger would have stung though. The German centre-back spent five years at Stamford Bridge before being snapped up by Real Madrid for nothing.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Wilfried Zaha\nNo contest here. Zaha is Palace’s greatest player of all time. He left when his contract expired in the summer of 2023, joining Turkish giants Galatasaray in an ambitious move for Champions League football.",
      "After years of transfer stories linking him with a move to Arsenal, Zaha could not shine in Turkey and was loaned out to French side Lyon after a season. That did not go to plan either and he is now playing under Dean Smith for Charlotte FC in MLS.",
      "",
      "Everton: Wayne Rooney\nObviously not the first time because that was for a transfer fee, but the second time Rooney left Everton is probably their most significant Bosman loss of the Premier League era.",
      "Rooney scored an impressive ten goals in 30 league matches in 2017/18. Not only was his Goodison Park exit felt, but his arrival in the United States to play for D.C. United was as well. He would later go on to manage the MLS side for 453 days.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Tosin Adarabioyo\nFulham screwed the pooch by letting Moussa Dembele join Celtic but that is more of a regret than a big transfer. Tosin Adarabioyo left the Cottagers for west London rivals Chelsea last summer in his prime years. It was gutting for Marco Silva but they have done just fine with Joachim Andersen returning as his replacement.",
      "",
      "Ipswich: Sylvain Legwinski\nIt was always going to be difficult to find someone Ipswich regretfully released while they were a Premier League club and it turns out there was literally nobody worth mentioning. As a result, we have copped out and picked the player with the highest market value on Transfermarkt to leave the Tractor Boys for nothing. That man is Sylvain Legwinski, who departed after the 2007/08 campaign and did not find a club until the following April before spending a few months at St. Neots Town.",
      "",
      "Leicester: Youri Tielemans\nCaglar Soyuncu was an unfortunate loss but nothing comes close to Tielemans’ exit at the end of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "The Belgian left as a club legend after his FA Cup final winner in 2021. He was linked with Arsenal for bloody ages but ended up joining Aston Villa. After a difficult first year under Unai Emery, Tielemans is back to being one of the best midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold\n“Giving everything day in, day out for 20 years, I’ve got to a point now where I feel like I need a new change, a new challenge for me as a player and as a person. And I think now is the right time for me to do that.”",
      "Alexander-Arnold’s Liverpool departure has been confirmed and while there was no mention of Real Madrid in the club statement, we all know he is moving to the Spanish capital.",
      "This is a huge loss for Liverpool but from the outside looking in, it’s hard to blame Alexander-Arnold for wanting to spread his wings and challenge for the Ballon d’Or with the biggest club in the world. Good luck to him.",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Ilkay Gundogan\nApologies for snubbing Sergio Aguero and Pep Guardiola’s ‘we cannoh replace him’ crocodile tears, but Gundogan is an easy choice. Alongside Erling Haaland, he was probably City’s most important player in their Treble-winning 2022/23 campaign, with his last job as City captain being to lift the Champions League trophy.",
      "The German returned after a year at Barcelona but he isn’t as good anymore. We thought he would be fantastic as well…",
      "In terms of successful free transfer signings, James Milner’s move from City to Liverpool is certainly up there, but that is not what we are looking at so I will shut up.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Paul Pogba\nThe difficult years that followed Peter Schmeichel’s departure in 1999 make him worth an honourable mention at least, but the fact Pogba left on a free transfer twice shades it for him.",
      "Pogba’s time at Manchester United was riddled with discourse. On His Day, he was a world beater. Unfortunately for the Red Devils, he was pretty much only ever On His Day for France.",
      "The best part of it all is obviously that Man United let Pogba join Juventus for nothing in 2012, re-signed him for a world-record £89million four years later, then let him join Juventus for nothing AGAIN in 2022.",
      "United giving him a fat new contract and then losing him to that doping ban might have been overkill, even for them.",
      "",
      "Newcastle: Jonas Gutierrez\nGutierrez’s exit in 2015 was emblematic of what Newcastle were under Mike Ashley’s ownership. The Argentine kept the Magpies in the Premier League after returning to the team following a bout with cancer and ended up being released over the phone by John Carver.",
      "“John Carver rang me and told me the club weren’t going to offer me a new deal,” Ryan Taylor said at the time. “Then he asked me to pass the phone to Jonas, which was unbelievable… I can’t really blame John because he’s under instructions on what to do.”",

      "Psycho was a fair bit older than Lingard but desperate times lead to desperate measures. After spending 12 years at the club, Pearce walked on a Bosman in 1997.",
      "It was a difficult final season for Pearce, who assumed caretaker player-manager duty following Frank Clark’s resignation. The role was eventually shared with Dave Bassett but Forest went down and a 35-year-old Pearce wanted out, joining Newcastle United.",

      "No team has accrued more points nor scored more goals against the top seven than Bournemouth – and that includes those sides within it. Their return from games against the teams directly below them have ultimately undermined any Champions League push; both Brentford and Brighton doing the double over them was sub-optimal. But European qualification has been made possible by how effective they have become against the division’s best.",
      "That is pertinent because of a run-in which features the visit of Aston Villa and a trip to Manchester City, neither of which should hold any trepidation for a group which has already won at the Emirates, Old Trafford at St James’ Park this season.",

      "The feeling persists that Iraola might not be able to replicate this success on the shakier foundations which come higher up the ladder with less time and patience, but it remains an entirely tantalising prospect we must one day witness.",
      "It is impressive how the Spaniard seems able to contort himself into fitting numerous different job specifications. When the Spurs links started to formalise he wisely embarked on a winless run which included exiting a cup competition to show his suitability, before undoing Arsenal with set-piece mastery to plant some possible post-Arteta seeds. Neat trick, that.",

Brentford brought Kayode in on loan from Fiorentina in January and have a £14m option to make the deal permanent, which they would be foolish not to execute. It is already difficult to think of many better signings this season.",
      "After an inevitably slow integration, the Italy youth international has found his stride. Three Premier League starts have coincided with Brentford’s first run of three consecutive Premier League wins of the season and his stated aim of “helping them reach European competitions next season” is alive.",
      "It was Kayode ugly for Manchester United but beautiful to watch a 20-year-old acclimatise so seamlessly to the league, setting up Yoane Wissa’s goal, misplacing one pass and completing more than twice as many dribbles as any other player at the Gtech.",

      "Manchester City’s old guard\nIt has been difficult to separate baby from bathwater when examining what should be thrown out at Manchester City this season, but this surge to their longest winning run of the campaign to cap what might be an outwardly respectable second-placed Premier League finish with an FA Cup winner’s medal does suggest that an element of restraint is necessary.",
      "Kevin de Bruyne bowing out from the club with a fine impression of his former unparalleled self should not shake the foundations of what is the fair decision to allow his contract to expire. This form and fitness might be sustainable and a post-Etihad career flourish could make Manchester City look foolish. But it is not a gamble even the impossibly rich should overthink if there is to be any sort of emphasis on building for the future.",
      "His final gift has been to hold Manchester City’s hand into the Champions League after this campaign’s substantial scare, simultaneously displaying himself in the shop window for those interested in parting with a ludicrous signing-on fee and wage.",
      "Bernardo Silva said that “a little bit of the soul of this team is going” with De Bruyne and it reinforces the belief that despite the Portuguese’s own personal struggles, he should be persuaded to stay for yet another year before his own deal expires in 2026. Pep Guardiola would surely prefer not to lose the two most-used players in his entire managerial career over the course of one summer, with decisions to come soon enough on Ilkay Gundogan and Mateo Kovacic too.",
      "The manager recently admitted his reluctance to use the club’s inexperienced academy graduates in this season’s more difficult moments was a mistake. A happy medium can be found, like Nico O’Reilly further embedding himself in a side anchored by that spine containing four 30-something midfield pass masters who have helped Manchester City rediscover their identity before they make necessary moves to update and improve it.",

      "Almost 300 players have played 1,000 minutes in the Premier League this season and Enciso ranks first of those for shots per 90 (4.12). Those numbers are skewed only slightly by a productive first half of the season at Brighton; the Paraguayan’s shots per 90 for Ipswich sandwich him between Mo Salah and Alexander Isak as an outlier among the league’s biggest strugglers.",
      "It would be no surprise to see Ipswich and McKenna learn from this season’s harsh lessons to return to this level soon; far more shocking would be if Enciso isn’t back immediately, shooting from ridiculous positions and earning weirdly respectful handshakes from a beaten Jordan Pickford.",

      "Newcastle had made a decent fist of that balance by simply winning 20 of their last 26 matches and losing the rest. That all-or-nothing approach ended their trophy drought and made Champions League qualification a live possibility.",
      "Only 11 teams in Premier League history had ever gone longer without a draw than Newcastle, who finally made sure they followed their manager’s advice and didn’t lose on one of the increasingly rare occasions when victory was not possible.",
      "A first draw for five months in any competition could be crucial, keeping the Magpies above Chelsea and Nottingham Forest regardless of their results in this tireless race. Avoiding a ruinous seasonal hat-trick of losses in the Yankuba Minteh/Dan Burn/James Milner/Chris Wood/Aaron Hughes/Tim Krul/Dan Ashworth derby was just a welcome bonus.",

      "Mats Wieffer\nNot, it seems, a right-back.",
      "",
      "Arsenal\nIt was, in some ways, ideal preparation. Bournemouth are as similar a Premier League team to PSG as Arsenal could wish to play, uber-aggressive in the press with numerous different ways of hurting an opponent. But equally Mikel Arteta might have preferred to face any other side in between those semi-final legs.",
      "The idea was sound enough, going basically full-strength to build momentum, rhythm and confidence. The potentially season-shattering risk of an avoidable, belief-shattering defeat to an excellent side was the trade-off and while PSG themselves were beaten at the weekend by Strasbourg, they made ten changes to the starting XI which conquered the Emirates and will be fresh at the Parc des Princes.",
      "Arteta can only try to harness this and it might be that the “rage, anger, frustration and a bad feeling in the tummy” is actually what Arsenal need to pull them through and into the Champions League final.",
      "Yet the Gunners have not looked so vulnerable in as many different areas in some time, from set-piece defending to lead-squandering.",
      "The very real and very funny prospect of Arsenal failing to qualify for the Champions League while Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle, Chelsea and one of Manchester United or Spurs all win a trophy and reach the European Promised Land is on, and it starts with Nottingham Forest beating Crystal Palace on Monday night.",
      "",
      "Fulham\nMarco Silva seethed at Aston Villa’s time-wasting and an apparent refereeing conspiracy to undermine Fulham’s excellence by booking both himself and five of his players. But the fizzling out of what was almost an incredible season has been down to the fundamental flaws in his approach more than anything.",
      "It is a perfect summary of the fine margins Silva relies on that Fulham have had 18 games decided either way by a single goal in the Premier League this season, and they have won nine and lost nine of them. While it guarantees safety – which is an achievement a recently promoted club should not take for granted – it also places a ceiling on what Fulham can do. It inhibits them as much as it enhances them.",
      "That is why Fulham’s longest winning run matches their worst losing streak of two games, why they have had consecutive Premier League victories only once since November, why they can beat the distant champions and by far worst team in the division in between four defeats to clubs in the Premier League’s hard-boiled centre.",
      "It is also quite weird that Fulham have now ended two games this season with ten men despite not having someone sent off, with an injury suffered after all their substitutes were made. Not sure Emi Martinez can be blamed for that.",
      "",
      "Manchester United\nRuben Amorim cannot specifically be faulted for honouring the established trope of Premier League teams chucking out the kids to prepare for big European games.",
      "But the idea that Manchester United can actively sacrifice their Premier League season without severe censure feels doubly cowardly. It’s as if they think them giving up on it meaning anything in a material sense pre-emptively counteracts criticism or scrutiny. And when ruthless redundancies are being made, the haemorrhaging of potential prize money is an absolutely atrocious look.",
      "In any event, a ludicrously expensive squad and coach should be able to hold their own and at the very least have an identifiable style, no matter how many changes are wrought. Never allow Manchester United being this abysmal to be normalised, accepted or forgotten.",
      "",
      "Everton\nIf you don’t love David Moyes at his nine-game unbeaten streak, you don’t deserve him at his run of one win in ten games which has neatly overlapped.",
      "It does feel as though the second wedding’s honeymoon is over, that the bloom is off the rose somewhat and Everton have slipped back into their worst habits. And when their worst habits were established at the start of the season as proving 2-0 to indeed be the most dangerous lead, that isn’t ideal.",
      "Their relative ease in sweeping into a two-goal lead over Ipswich underlined how much better than the bottom three they are, but the implosion to hand Ipswich their first points from a losing position since November emphasised the work that needs to be done to steer Everton in the right direction next season.",
      "Moyes has earned the opportunity to oversee these steps into a brave new era but he will know that performance and more generally the last few weeks have not really been good enough.",
      "Sean Dyche was sacked for a run of two wins, seven draws and four defeats; Moyes is currently on two wins, seven draws and three defeats and saying “we controlled the game” after being outshot eight to 12 at home to a relegated team sounds eerily like his predecessor.",
      "",
      "Southampton\nAfter all that it really could come down to goal difference. Southampton (-57) have some wiggle room over Derby 2007/08 (-69) but Manchester City, Arsenal and Everton’s final game at Goodison Park keeps the drama alive heading into the final weeks.",
      "One record will almost certainly fall. Four sides share the honour of having lost 29 games in a Premier League season. Southampton are on 28 and have just had the league double done over them by the next-worst team. It’s not looking great.",
      "",
      "Liverpool when crowned champions\nLiverpool have played eight games as newly-crowned Premier League champions in 2019/20 and 2024/25 and they should be ashamed by a cigar-puffing, beach-dwelling, slipper-wearing record of W4 D1 L3 F16 A15.",
      "Bournemouth were wining 1-0 at the time of Evanilson’s red card before conceding a late equaliser to Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca will serve a touchline ban during their Champions League qualification race after getting booked against Fulham.",
      "Clinton Morrison doubts Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou “will be in a job on Saturday” if they lose to Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday.",

      "Man Utd are closing in on their first summer departure with Atletico Madrid ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed the Brazil international to leave Old Trafford and move to Real Betis on loan until the end of the season in the winter transfer window.",
      "Man Utd spent around £87m on Antony in the summer of 2022 but he made very little impact in his two-and-a-half seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony contributed just five Premier League goals and three assists in 62 appearances with the 25-year-old making no league starts this season before the Red Devils offloaded him to Betis.",
      "But the Brazilian has been impressing in La Liga with the winger contributing six goals and two assists in 19 matches in all competitions for the Spanish outfit.",
      "Real Betis have been keen to make the move permanent in summer with Man Utd hoping to permanently remove him from their books.",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Atletico Madrid are ‘very close to completing a move’ for Antony with the Spanish understood to have ‘submitted a €40 million offer to Manchester United to secure his services.’",
      "Real Betis ‘hoped to negotiate a permanent purchase at the end of the season’ but rivals Atletico Madrid ‘has preemptively made a compelling offer that has convinced United’.",
      "Atletico have been ‘monitoring the Brazilian player’s progress for weeks’ and manager Diego Simeone is ‘convinced that Antony can provide the speed and directness his team needs to make a competitive leap forward in both LaLiga and the Champions League’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The 40 million euro offer from the Red and Whites, presented in the last few hours, has been welcomed by Manchester United, who are willing to part with the player for a sum that allows them to recoup part of the initial investment made when they signed him from Ajax. The deal, in financial terms, is very close to being finalized, and talks are expected to progress rapidly in the coming weeks.’",
      "Real Betis are ‘unable to compete financially with Atletico’s financial muscle’ and the Verdiblancos had hoped their ‘good relationship with the player and with the United team could facilitate a more affordable negotiation’.",
      "And now it looks likely that Atletico Madrid will complete a ‘luxury addition’ for next season and the potential signing of Antony ‘could be one of the first major moves of what promises to be a busy summer at the Metropolitano headquarters’.",
      "Former Man Utd assistant manager Rene Meulensteen recently advised Antony to stay at Real Betis as he “has no future” at Old Trafford.",
      "Meulensteen said: “Antony has no future at Manchester United. If I was him, I’d stay at Real Betis, without a doubt. He’s never really lived up to the expectations or the price tag at United, but he’s found his feet in Spain. He seems to be a lot happier playing football and in life generally at Betis – which is the most important thing.",
      "“If he returned to Manchester, he’d fall straight back into the rut he was in before he left, which wouldn’t be good for anybody. I can’t see him returning under any circumstance; it’s probably best for all parties that he joins Betis on a permanent deal.”",
      "Spurs in Norway on an artificial pitch? Nothing to worry about, lads. Meanwhile, Mikel Arteta must inspire an Arsenal comeback against PSG.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim is eyeing two Real Betis players as the Red Devils ‘propose a swap deal’ in a £25.5m ‘discount’ for Antony.",
      "Man Utd are hoping to include a Real Betis player in any deal they strike for Antony in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd plan on spending the money they receive from Atletico Madrid for Antony on Borussia Dortmund star Jamie Gittens, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘received’ a huge offer to sell Brazil international Antony with his form for Real Betis ‘not going unnoticed’.",
      "Arsenal are hopeful that they can get a deal for Man Utd flop Antony wrapped up ‘as soon as possible’, according to reports."

      "Arteta and Art class…\nHaving attended Art class, I found Andy H, Swansea’s entry fairly persuasive, but I have to reject one of his premises, i.e., that Arsenal were a “pratfalling mess” when Mikel Arteta arrived.",
      "I think that Andy’s assessment of Arteta’s performance is reasonably fair in itself, but Arsene Wenger’s final league finish was sixth, not fourteenth or seventeenth. A team finishing sixth in any EPL season is hardly a team doing pratfalls. They were a club with a legendary manager who led the Invincibles and transformed English football…which, in return, grew beyond him.",
      "They had plenty of talent when Arteta arrived, if some of it had been misused. They were in no sense a mess; they just needed a new coach. Maybe they needed one a couple of years earlier, but I don’t really know, as I’m not Stewie Griffin*. Arteta has improved them, no doubt, but he hardly applied CPR.",
      "I deleted a whole nostalgic paragraph about having driven for two and a half hours to see Newcastle lose an FA Cup final and Why I Don’t Hate Arsenal, but I was only belabouring things.",
      "On the other hand, five and a half years of watching Mikel Arteta at Arsenal have taught me to detest Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. I have Mailbox form here, as it were, and won’t belabour my beef either, though I will repeat that I always liked him as a player.",
      "But the fact remains that, whatever his failings, Arteta is at the very least a good coach who can really nail it against an opponent like Real Madrid once in a while. He has beaten a lot of good coaches, whatever his transfer market failures. If I were an Arsenal supporter, I think I’d be ambivalent. The wrong upgrade could be disastrous.",
      "Perhaps handing over a bit of transfer control would benefit him. Maybe he should be telling the board and Director what he wants, not who he wants, and let the scouts, the stattos and Edu go find it.",
      "All that said, my club’s won exactly one real pot in my 30 years of support, and it still feels like yesterday. Fans of some clubs think it’s an utter shambles, a travesty of justice, the end of the world when their club don’t win at least one trophy in any given season. It’s beyond me. My expectations just aren’t calibrated the way “big club” supporters I read here or in the socials.",
      "And no offense to those Gunners, but I hope they never will be. It seems to steal a lot of joy. My philosophy has always been that losing is part of sport; if you don’t know losing, what do you really know? (Besides winning, obvs.)",

      "Personally, I look at last season where Arteta’s Arsenal turned in their best league points (and GD?) second only to the Invincibles. That’s pretty good, Man City were very slightly better over 38 games so they won the league. We all know Man City have been an unprecedented level of dominance in the league since well before Arteta joined Arsenal for various sporting reasons – even ignoring the 115 stuff they are strongest club by far.",
      "This season has not gone as well, not just for Arsenal but for quite a few other “big” clubs. Despite all our “Shitness”, we are still the second best team in the league and I think that gets under some folk’s skin.",
      "Anyway, regarding not winning anything – here is the exhaustive list of managers who have won competitions Arteta has not. I am excluding domestic cups and European competitions apart from the Champions League because they don’t count in these conversations. Winning an FA Cup would not change people’s position – “ah but he can’t win the league” etc…besides, just ask Ten Hag or David Moyes whether these comps are enough to keep your job on their own. Critics like to tout the cups as a stick to beat Arteta but would not allow winning them as a defense. They are very nice though but small beer apparently – so onwards!",

      "Rio Ferdinand\nI don’t really like Rio Ferdinand on comms, for many reasons but you can’t question his talent as footballer. An absolute Rolls Royce of a defender. He played alongside Vidic? Yep, and they complemented each other perfectly. Rio was the best centre back of the noughties in the Premier League (lots of fashionable foreign defenders then too). Better on the ball and still less of a bellend than John Terry. He’d be equally lauded today as then if he was playing now. Ball playing centre backs are not a modern phenomenon either (Bobby Moore?). If I didn’t support United I’d say Van Dijk was better (almost as if you combined Vidic and Rio) but I do so I’ll stick by my man.",
      "I also completely agree with J. Nicholson about the embarrassment of United and Spurs pissing the Europa League. But it’s UEFA that should be embarrassed. It all started when they let runners up join the Champions League (literally adding losers ruins the name a bit). What we have now is a European Super League by stealth supported by two lesser European competitions which act as a safety net for teams like United who struggle to qualify the proper way. Much like VAR, we can never go back.",
      "And finally, there is so much nuance to some of the issues that are constantly debated in these hallowed pages and that affect our wonderful game. That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue.

      "However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.",
      "I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.",
      "As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\nLewis, Busby Way",

Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.",
      "From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.",
      "A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years.

      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Monday 5 May 2025 12:52, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are not ready to be competitive in the Premier League and Champions League next season.",
      "United racked up their 16th defeat of the league season, their most for 35 years, with the 4-3 loss at European hopefuls Brentford, a result that mathematically consigns them to a bottom-half finish.",
      "Amorim, who made eight changes and named the third-youngest side in Premier League history, was prioritising Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club, with United 3-0 up on aggregate.",
      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""

      "Brentford increased their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time as they beat a much-changed Manchester United 4-3 in a thriller at the Gtech.",
      "Conversely, it was Man Utd's 16th league defeat of the season, their most since the 1989/90 season, when they also lost 16.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim took charge on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",
      "Brentford:  Flekken (6), Kayode (8), Collins (6), Van den Berg (6), Lewis-Potter (6), Norgaard (7), Yarmoliuk (7), Mbeumo (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (9), Wissa (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Jensen (6), Henry (6), Ajer (n/a), Nunes (n/a), Thiago (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd:  Bayindir (6), Fredricson (5), De Ligt (6), Shaw (4), Dorgu (5), Ugarte (7), Mainoo (6), Amass (6), Mount (7), Garnacho (8), Obi (5).\n\n\nSubs used:  Maguire (6), Yoro (6), Diallo (7), Eriksen (7), Lindelof (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the match:  Kevin Schade.",
      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",
      "\"We've got this momentum, hopefully we can keep it up. It's all about getting the job done and it's one at a time. We had a laser, laser, laser focus throughout four seasons on the next game. It's all about the next game.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think it reflected our season. We started quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances but controlling the pace of the game. We suffered a lot with the throw-ins and set-pieces but we already knew that our team would struggle against this team.",
      "\"We didn't have the height necessary for this kind of game. They scored twice in this kind of moments, even with De Ligt on the floor.",
      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",
