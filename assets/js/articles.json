      "Manchester United are still pushing to sign a goalkeeper before Monday night's transfer deadline – with Aston Villa's Emi Martinez one of their targets.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants an upgrade on Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, with Martinez and Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens having emerged as the two contenders for the No.1 spot. It is understood Argentina World Cup winner Martinez is preferred because of his greater experience, particularly in the Premier League, which is why United are pushing hard for him.",
      "There have been unconfirmed suggestions that Martinez has been left out of Villa's squad for tonight's Premier League encounter at home to Crystal Palace, ahead of his potential exit.",
      "Villa would want around £40million for Martinez, while Lammens, 23, would cost United in the region of £20m, which is a major consideration for United, against the backdrop of Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Martinez turns 33 next week and selling him to United would help Villa in their compliance with PSR and they are understood to be willing to cash in on their experienced keeper if a fee meets their valuation of him.",
      "Onana, who cost United £43m from Inter Milan in 2023, was at fault in United's shock EFL Cup exit at Grimsby in midweek, while Bayindir has also struggled in his outings against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley.",
      "Former United defender Victor Lindelof, who left at the end of last season when his contract expired, is understood to be on the verge of joining Villa.",
      "The Sweden international made 284 appearances for the Red Devils across an eight-year spell at the club.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United centre-back Victor Lindelof is on the verge of a Premier League return with Aston Villa. The Swedish defender left United when his contract expired at the end of June, and has been biding his time while waiting for his next move.",
      "Lindelof joined United from Benfica when Jose Mourinho was manager and ended up spending eight years at Old Trafford before being let go by Ruben Amorim. He played nearly 300 games for the club, winning both domestic cups and making the squad for the Europa League final defeats in 2021 and 2025.",
      "According to The Times, Lindelof is set to undergo a medical with Villa after spending the summer training in his homeland with Vasteras. That might not be the only deal involving Unai Emery's side on deadline day.",
      "Question marks remain over the future of Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez, who is a potential target for United. If the World Cup winner moves on then Emery would look to add a new senior keeper, with reports on the continent suggesting Porto's Diogo Costa is one option.",
      "Emery is also keen on a reunion with Marco Asensio. The Spanish forward impressed on loan from Paris Saint-Germain last season but returned to the French capital over the summer.",
      "Villa have also been mentioned in connection with West Ham playmaker Lucas Paqueta. The Hammers don't want to sell, though, and the Brazilian was named in the starting XI for their game away to Nottingham Forest on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Emery's side haven't been the busiest in the window so far. Evann Guessand has been their highest-profile signing, joining from Nice for £26m, wile other new faces include Dutch duo Marco Bizot and Zepiqueno Redmond.",
      "Lindelof's former club United continued their wait for a clean sheet on Saturday. They did get a first win of the new campaign, though, with Bruno Fernandes scoring a last-minute winner in a topsy-turvy game against Burnley.",
      "\"It is three points, if you look at the game we should solve it in the first half and control the game - but we are fighting to the last minute because of things we overcomplicate,\" United boss Amorim said. \"Look at the first half, we have so many chances to score.",
      "\"You feel you can control the game. But one throw-in, one set-piece. I shook my head, because sometimes football is like this. This was a game we had to win, but we have a lot to do.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag could pay the ultimate price for his poor start to life at Bayer Leverkusen amid claims in Germany that the Bundesliga outfit have already decided to axe the former Manchester United manager.",
      "Ten Hag, 55, signed a contract until 2027 back in May after being selected to succeed Xabi Alonso, who guided Leverkusen to their first ever German title. Ten Hag always had big shoes to fill with Alonso moving onto pastures new - but it now seems the 'experiment' of appointing the Dutchman may be over before it could even get going.",
      "After watching Leverkusen twice blow a lead in their 3-3 draw with Werder Bremen on Saturday, Kicker claim that the club's top brass may shortly take nuclear action with last year's Bundesliga runners-up winless after their opening two league games.",
      "It's noted that there was no statement in support of Ten Hag either before or after Saturday's match, where Werder Bremen struck in the 94th minute to deny Leverkusen victory.",
      "Furthermore, there has been 'criticism' of Ten Hag internally with Leverkusen planning to review their head coach's future after the transfer window closes on Monday, with the report going on to suggest that Simon Rolfes and Co have 'probably already made up their minds'.",
      "Such a move would represent a significant blow for Ten Hag, whose reputation was bruised by a turbulent final few months at Old Trafford. He was expected to be sacked despite winning the FA Cup in his final full season at the helm, only to be handed a contract extension. He was then removed from his post before the end of October after another chastening run of form.",
      "Speaking after Saturday's late collapse against Bremen, Ten Hag said: “The players aren’t ready. We have a new team and some of the players aren’t at all fit enough to play. The team didn’t function at all during the final stage of the game. That’s just the way it is. They need to bring more intensity and get fitter in order to meet my standards.",
      "“After the international break, we face real competition and must perform as a team. That begins with taking responsibility and delivering individual performances. And they have to demonstrate to me that they want to work together.”",

      "New Barcelona signing Roony Bardghji is still yet to be registered by the cash-strapped club seven weeks after joining them. Bardghji, 19, signed for Barca from Danish giants Copenhagen, where he made his name as one of the most talked-about wonderkids in Scandinavian football.",
      "Bardghji's biggest moment came against Manchester United during the Champions League group stage in November 2023. After United blew a 3-2 lead in the Danish capital, contributing to the Red Devils' early exit that season, the Sweden youth international came off the bench and scored a stunning goal to win the game for Copenhagen.",
      "A serious knee injury kept Bardghji out for most of last season, returning in March after 334 days on the sidelines. Barcelona snapped him up in July, yet their financial problems have led to a tumultuous start to his career in Catalunya.",
      "Due to La Liga's salary cap rules, Barca have struggled to register players, as they've needed to offload first. Club chiefs recently took advantage of a rule which allows them to use some of injured captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen's wages in order to sign-off on players.",
      "After Ter Stegen agreed to the move following an ugly dispute with Barcelona officials, United loanee Marcus Rashford and new goalkeeper Joan Garcia were registered the day before their opening game of the season at Mallorca, a 3-0 win. No new players were registered in time for last Sunday's 3-2 victory over Levante.",
      "But this week, ahead of Barca's third league game away to Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, the departures of Oriol Romeu and Inaki Pena have allowed Wojciech Szczesny and Gerard Martin - two players who were regulars in Hansi Flick's squad last term - to finally be registered. That leaves Bardghji as the only exception.",
      "The Kuwait-born winger has been linked with a loan move before the summer transfer window closes on Monday, although he's stated his determination to stay and become a key part of Flick's squad, having been given the No.19 shirt. \"I hope I can stay at Barcelona for many years and perhaps for my entire career,\" Bardghji recently told Marca.",
      "Who should Manchester United sign before the transfer window shuts? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "\"I'll do everything I can to make this happen. I hope I can leave the legacy of my predecessors like Henrik Larsson or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. My team-mates have been really good; they’ve looked after me well, I'm enjoying every day as a Barcelona player.",
      "\"I always try to play the same way, with the same philosophy that Barca has always had, and Hansi's style suits me very well. Honestly, I feel at home.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is on the verge of breaking a Manchester United golden rule that has lasted almost 90 years. Woven into the fabric of the Red Devils’ history and club culture is the production line of academy talents into the first team.",
      "Following the countless names to make the step, the Class of ‘92 were the most famous group of players to ascend, having a seismic impact on English football. Even in the period since those glory years, England internationals like Danny Welbeck, Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford showed that Carrington can still produce high-quality youngsters.",
      "As such, United have managed to maintain an astonishing tradition that is the envy of rival clubs, by including an academy graduate in every first-team squad since October 1937. However, that record now appears vulnerable.",
      "Following Rashford’s move to Barcelona, Alejandro Garnacho’s Chelsea transfer and veteran Jonny Evans’ retirement, Kobbie Mainoo is one of the only players in the current squad to have come through the academy alongside Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson - and was the only one who featured in Saturday's 3-2 win over Burnley.",
      "But even the 20-year-old has now been linked with an exit due to Amorim’s lack of faith in the midfielder. Mainoo was once considered a key component of United's future due to his performances over the last two seasons.",
      "The youngster racked up an impressive collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago. He also claimed the man of the match performance in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024 after scoring the winner.",
      "But, under Amorim, Mainoo has started just 16 games over the past two seasons. Having been left on the bench for two successive Premier League matches, Mainoo finally played in Wednesday's EFL Cup penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby.",
      "He had not played a minute of Premier League football this season before coming on as a half-time substitute in the 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday. That led to frustration on the youngster’s part.",
      "It was recently reported that Serie A champions Napoli were interested in offering the £50million-rated Mainoo a four-year contract. Having seen former United team-mate Scott McTominay make the same move 12 months ago and enjoy huge success, Mainoo reportedly told United bosses he wants to leave on a permanent deal ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline.",
      "Despite United’s negotiations over an extension to his current contract having stalled, the club opted to block his move to Serie A. And Amorim has been vocal about his desire for Mainoo to stay and fight for his place in the team, showing his reluctance to part ways with the team’s last academy graduate.",
      "The Portuguese said in his press conference ahead of the clash with Burnley: \"I want Kobbie to stay. He needs to fight for his place. And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change.",
      "“I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "While a section of fans have expressed concern on social media over United’s long-standing tradition potentially coming to an end, some are unfussed, believing the team’s performances should be a priority.",
      "Should Mainoo get his last-minute move to Napoli, United would still have veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton among their ranks to select for the matchday squad in order to preserve the tradition.",
      "But the 39-year-old, who featured for the academy between 2002 and 2005, is currently behind Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir in the pecking order, while United are reportedly eyeing a last-minute deal for either Emi Martinez or Senne Lammens, meaning the record is likely to be broken with Mainoo’s departure - unless a new academy starlet suddenly emerges.",

      "A 14-year-old goalscoring sensation by the name of JJ Gabriel has burst onto the scene at Manchester United, and fans are calling for the 'star boy' to be slotted into the first team as soon as possible. The young Red Devil stunned fans with his performance in the under-18s Premier League game on Saturday, where United triumphed 4-0 over Derby County.",
      "The teenager scored a 22-minute hat-trick, scoring in the fifth, 14th and 27th minutes to secure three goals before the half-hour mark of the game. Amir Ibragimov, 17, grabbed the other goal via a penalty in the 66th minute, but all anybody could talk about was the young Gabriel.",
      "Fans took to social media to hail the young forward's performance at the weekend, with one claiming he will become United's new star boy after Alejandro Garnacho's departure for Chelsea. They said: \"Chelsea took our egotistic Garnacho away, but La Carrington is cooking another starboy, his name is JJ Gabriel, bagged a hat-trick today. He’s just 14!\"",
      "Another said: \"How did I forget my star boy JJ Gabriel? Invest your stocks now!\" while a third added: \"JJ Gabriel has a hat-trick in 27 minutes for Manchester United Under 18's against Derby. He is 14 years old. Protect him at all costs.\"",
      "With more calls for the Old Trafford hierarchy to \"protect\" the young player at the club, it seems that these protests have been heard by the top brass. Gabriel committed his future to United this summer, as per Sports Illustrated, and is set to stay at Old Trafford until he is 16 years old - when he can sign a professional deal with the club.",
      "As reported earlier this month, the youngster, dubbed 'Kid Messi', will be permitted to train with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad at points throughout the season to bed him into the top level of football and has already been called up.",
      "Technical director Jason Wilcox is understood to have taken an active role in convincing the teenager to stay at United after he met with boss Amorim at the training ground in an effort to make him feel more part of the team.",
      "While it isn't a new thing for academy players to train with the first team - and sometimes graduate early to be a crucial part of the starting XI - the fact Gabriel is already making waves at just 14 suggests his ceiling could be incredibly high.",
      "Gabriel will, however, not be part of United's quest to win the FA Youth Cup this season as players have to be born before the cut-off date of 31 August 2010.",
      "Gabriel, who is the son of former Republic of Ireland international, Joe O'Cearuill, has scored five goals in three appearances for the under-18s team so far this season, including the hat-trick against Derby and goals against Middlesbrough and Everton.",
      "Last season, the youngster scored three goals in three appearances, catching the eye of many with his flair, skill and striking ability at such a young age.",
      "Some United fans have even likened him to Barcelona's Lamin Yamal, as one excited supporter wrote: \"JJ Gabriel is a different level of talent. Man Utd must try to keep him at all costs. Can see why Barcelona want him, could a be LW version of Yamal in future.\"",
      "Meanwhile, another added: \"I really hope that we can hold onto JJ Gabriel - he looks amazing and is only 14. There is a lot of chatter that he may move on. As he's an Irish passport holder, he could join the likes of Barcelona now.\"",
      "Due to Gabriel's holding of an Irish passport, the 14-year-old would be allowed to make the move to a European club from the age of 16 rather than 18 years old - tempting the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid and even Bayern Munich, according to Goal.com.",
      "But with his United deal signed and his prowess showing in a league far above his age, Gabriel may just be the wonderkid the Old Trafford faithful could be seeing a lot more of in the years to come.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

We've already seen plenty of huge transfers, from Liverpool's record-breaking Florian Wirtz swoop to long-awaited moves for Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko, but there's still more work to be done.",
      "Indeed, injuries over the weekend have left some clubs wondering if they might need to dip back into the market. Liam Delap is set to miss a few weeks for Chelsea, while Manchester United are sweating on both Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount.",
      "Clubs in England's top tier have until September 1 to get any new signings confirmed. It's the same across Europe's major leagues, including La Liga in Spain, Serie A in Italy and the German Bundesliga.",
      "There will still be a chance to get sales done after that, with the Saudi Pro League window remaining open until September 10 and the Turkish Super Lig wrapping up one day after that. Clubs will also be able to sign free agents outside the window, providing they were without a club by deadline day.",
      "Hincapie's Arsenal switch looks all but done, and is likely to be the Gunners' final new signing. The move is set to be a loan with a view to a permanent move next summer - worth around £45million.",
      "The Ecuador defender will be an option for his new club at centre-back or left-back. He was an unused substitute for Erik ten Hag's Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday as they threw away a 3-1 lead to draw with 10-man Werder Bremen.",
      "Hincapie's arrival in North London is due to be accompanied by an exit for Jakub Kiwior. The Poland international is set to join Porto on loan, with an obligation to move to the Dragao next summer.",
      "By selling Garnacho on Saturday, Manchester United drew a line under one of this summer's big transfer sagas. More could follow, with Real Betis' stand-off over Antony persisting, while Hojlund's Napoli switch is drawing closer.",
      "Danish striker Hojlund has been sidelined by the arrival of Sesko, and it has become clear he isn't part of Ruben Amorim's first-team plans. AC Milan were linked earlier in the window, but Napoli are now poised to win the race and offer him Champions League football.",
      "The Serie A holders will bring Hojlund in on loan, with an obligation to buy at the end of the season. He arrived in Italy over the weekend with an announcement looking imminent.",
      "United's main priority, after strengthening their front-line before the start of the season, is to add a new goalkeeper to their ranks. Altay Bayindir has started in the league so far, with Andre Onana between the sticks in the Carabao Cup, but neither has convinced.",
      "Belgian stopper Senne Lammens and Aston Villa star Emi Martinez appear to be the leading contenders. Martinez would be the choice if Premier League experience is the main goal, with Lammens the younger model with a high ceiling.",
      "Galatasaray have also been linked with Lammens, who has missed Antwerp's last two league matches. However, the Turkish side could yet end up bringing in Ederson from Manchester City.",
      "The big one for much of the window, Isak's move is drawing closer. Newcastle have a new record signing after Nick Woltemade's £65m arrival from Stuttgart, though they may still need a second new forward before allowing Isak to leave.",
      "Sweden star Isak was absent again on Saturday, while Woltemade watched from the stands away at Leeds. A second blank in two away games emphasised the Magpies' need for reinforcements up top, but it looks like a return for Isak won't form part of that plan.",
      "Last season's top scorer has made it clear he feels his future lies away from St James' Park. A league record bid from Liverpool - surpassing the £120m including add-ons which Newcastle knocked back earlier in the window - can still do the trick.",
      "Isak made his case earlier in the window with a bold social media statement, and now Wissa has done the same. Newcastle have been targeting the Brentford star, and he appears to feel suitable offers have already arrived.",
      "“I received a formal offer from another Premier League club and communicated I wanted to join. I was under the impression, from all my conversations with Brentford, that there was a mutual agreement to part ways,\" Wissa wrote on Instagram.",
      "“Yet as the window comes to an end, the club has now significantly changed its position, going against what was communicated. This has left me in a difficult and frustrating position. The promise that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. It saddens me to have to write that, and I maintain total respect for the club and its fans.\"",
      "Aside from the Isak deal, Liverpool have work to do in defence. Giovanni Leoni has joined from Parma, but Crystal Palace captain Guehi would add a level of experience which the young Italian lacks.",
      "Guehi played 90 minutes in Europe on Thursday as Palace continue using the England international as normal while waiting for a resolution. Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has spoke of the challenge of finding a replacement, despite links with Manuel Akanji, but Guehi's contract situation could yet force the London club's hand.",
      "“From my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi replacement who can play straight in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,”Glasner said. “When we see our foundation of success in the last few months, it’s our defence … Marc is a crucial part. Getting the right replacement in now is almost impossible.”",
      "Jackson had been all set to join Bayern on loan, even jetting out to Germany. An injury to Delap has left the striker's Chelsea exit in the balance, though, despite protests from his agent, Diomansy Kamara.",
      "Senegal forward Jackson, who hasn't featured for Chelsea this season, remains keen on a move to the Bundesliga. A loan with an obligation or a straight purchase - rather than the agreed loan with an option - could yet see the deal completed.",
      "If Chelsea do still allow Jackson to leave, Delap's injury is expected to force them into the market for a new striker of their own.

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt insists the players are firmly behind under-fire boss Ruben Amorim and want him to stay. The immediate pressure eased on Amorim with Saturday's dramatic 3-2 win over Burnley, which came courtesy of a 97th-minute penalty from skipper Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That was United's first win of the season and it came on the back of their humiliating EFL Cup penalty shootout exit to League Two Grimsby in midweek. That upset turned up the heat on Amorim, but De Ligt said the players have faith in their head coach and admitted they must take much of the blame for their poor start to the season.",
      "Asked if United's players want Amorim to stay, De Ligt said: “Yeah, of course. I mean, as a player, you're responsible for the results. They always speak about the manager, obviously, but I think as players we also looked each other in the eye after Grimsby and said to each other, ‘Guys, the performance of this week is not acceptable’.",
      "“It will be really, I think, bad to say that it’s the manager’s fault. It's mostly us and we know that. So yeah, obviously we still stand behind him, and he stands behind us, so we keep going like that. I think the result for today makes that feeling even more.”",
      "United face two massive tests when they return following the international break, with a trip to local rivals Manchester City followed by a showdown with Chelsea at Old Trafford. “I think the only thing that counted today was a win,” De Ligt added.",
      "“Everybody saw how. We know we could have done that better, but the win was the most important thing. I don't think there's much been said [since the Grimsby game] because everybody knows how the feeling was.",
      "“I think everybody from outside could also understand what the feeling is if you lose a game like that. So, yeah, it's not easy. We know that. We were really disappointed, in ourselves especially, so then to win was I think the only cure that could a little bit help the defeat of Wednesday.",
      "“We had a lot of big chances in the first-half and we didn't score all of them, but we created a lot of big chances. I think we conceded just one shot from Hannibal [Mejbri], so that was really good.",
      "“The only thing is that the game is 90 minutes, today even more, so that's something that we have to improve on. But as I said, the only thing that counted was a win, so with that I'm really happy. If you win, that's the best feeling, and we did.”",

      "Burnley co-owner JJ Watt was not a happy man after Manchester United claimed a last-gasp win over the Clarets on Saturday. Bruno Fernandes scored from the penalty spot deep into added time, after Lyle Foster and Jaidon Anthony had dragged the visitors back in contention.",
      "Anthony went from hero to villain as he was penalised for a tug back on Amad. The foul was missed in real time, but awarded after a VAR check.",
      "While the winger definitely had hold of Amad's shirt, Watt's issue concerned where the foul had taken place. \"It was outside the box…\" he argued on social media, though the officials felt contact had continued into the penalty area.",
      "A number of fans disagreed with the former NFL star, who has been a minority owner at Turf Moor since 2023. \"Even if pulling starts outside the box but continues inside the box then it’s a penalty,\" one said.",
      "\"Ended inside the box. Think that’s the rule on shirt tugging,\" wrote a second. A third, meanwhile, argued United should have had a penalty earlier in the match after a clash between Kyle Walker and Mason Mount, with VAR overturning on-field referee's decision on that occasion.",
      "Burnley manager Scott Parker also voiced frustrations after the late penalty award. “In the modern day and the way football is these days, it’s become very sterile,\" he said.",
      "“That’s the way the game has gone - multiple checks of every single second and phase. It is what it is but of course we’re hugely frustrated and disappointed with how the game has ended.”",
      "Burnley have lost both away games in the league but this was a closer-run thing than their opening day reverse at Tottenham. South Africa striker Foster got off the mark for the season after scoring five times in the Clarets' last Premier League campaign, but he too was left frustrated by the manner of his team's defeat.",
      "“I'm disappointed for the game to end the way it ended,\" Foster said. \"I feel like we deserved something from the game, for it to end in that way I think it was a bit unjust. It is what it is, unfortunate. We played really well, and I think we can be proud of that.”",
      "The striker, who also had a goal disallowed for offside, added: “I’m grateful to have scored and more than anything for the performance by the team. That’s why I feel like it stings so much to walk away with nothing.”",

      "Rio Ferdinand has thrown his support behind Ruben Amorim at Manchester United and urged fans to stay positive. The ex-Red Devils defender hopes some harsh words were exchanged and fines dished out following the club's FA Cup exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "Following their unfortunate opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal, many anticipated a transformed United squad, boosted by the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, would build on their 15th-place finish from the previous campaign. Yet Amorim's troops have struggled from the off, with alarm bells ringing after their 1-1 stalemate with Fulham.",
      "Days following that outcome, in what proved a monumental shock, they crashed out of the FA Cup on spot-kicks to Grimsby. Come Saturday, a 97th-minute Bruno Fernandes spot-kick spared them from another deflating display, as they edged past Burnley 3-2, temporarily silencing speculation about boss Amorim facing the axe.",
      "Ferdinand, who turned out 455 times for the Red Devils, weighed in on demands for Amorim's dismissal prior to the Burnley encounter. Whilst he called for confrontation in the changing room, jokingly admitting he'd expect some financial penalties, the 46-year-old firmly backed Amorim and stayed hopeful about the Portuguese boss's reign.",
      "\"I'm hoping that in the changing room, he [Amorim] has had some choice words with those players, someone's been strangled, someone's been put in a headlock, someone's been fined,\" Ferdinand began, speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents channel.",
      "\"I'd like to think there's been some really, really solid hard conversations had, almost fights. I don't mind a fight, have one. Because I think moments like that, when it's on edge, when emotions are running high, when people are feeling embarrassed.",
      "\"There's been a lot of people talking, saying 'Oh, Ruben Amorim, give him the sack now.' Before a ball was kicked, everyone was optimistic, and I'm the same. Optimistic and hopeful. I'm hopeful that we're gonna improve.",
      "\"You can't sack someone after three games; it doesn't make sense,\" he continued, speaking before the Burnley win. \"You've allowed them to invest in three new strikers, and you're going to say after three games, when they're not even fully fit, that you're going to sack someone.",
      "\"It doesn't make sense to me. I don't see INEOS doing that. No way. I can't see it. They're more sensible than that. There are emotional people who pay good, hard-earned money who deserve to be entertained and deserve better performances and results. I get that.",
      "\"We all feel like that. But let's not be stupid. Let's not jump on the bandwagon and start getting all emotional about it, and say 'Right, I'm gonna start a vendetta.'",
      "\"Yes, there have been bad results, but when you try to turn things around at football clubs, especially one the size of Manchester United, that's been in turmoil and on a downward spiral for many years now, 10 or 12 years, do you think it's going to take six months or a year to turn that around? No. If we just keep changing managers every six months or every year, it's going to be the same thing for the next twenty years.\"",
      "Plenty have questioned Amorim's approach and relentless deployment of attacking wing-backs, but Ferdinand refuses to accept any criticism of the manager's reluctance to alter his formation, as he continued: \"The formation has been an issue for a lot of people. 'Should there be some flexibility in that?'",
      "\"But this manager will tell you, 'Yeah, we may start with three at the back. But there are moments in the game that we are playing four at the back, and we're shifting round.' It changes in terms of shape in and out of possession.",
      "\"I think you've got to allow the club to go through a period of pain if we feel there's a chance to get through the other side, and you're gonna see some sunlight. If you're allowing the manager to spend the money that we have, allowing him to let people go, then there has to be an element of patience through turmoil, and that's where we are right now.\"",
      "After a challenging few days, Amorim's squad managed to finish the week positively following a narrow three-point haul against Burnley. Despite relinquishing a one-goal advantage on two occasions, Fernandes rose to the occasion in the final moments to convert the decisive penalty and secure the club's maiden triumph of the campaign 3-2.",
      "\"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" the United boss revealed. When questioned whether these were lengthy concerns, he responded: \"I don't know, I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo may now have reason to stay at Old Trafford. The England international was linked with a move before deadline day, but injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount potentially offers him a chance for a run of games.",
      "Cunha, a £62.5million summer signing from Wolves, picked up an injury in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Burnley. It was Joshua Zirkzee who took his place on that occasion, but another option to make up for the Brazilian's absence involves pushing Bruno Fernandes forward and installing Mainoo in central midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "That's exactly what happened later in the game when Mount's afternoon also came to an early end. Now, according to The Mail, the pair of injuries may end up standing in the way of a Mainoo exit - though United have yet to learn how long they will be without Mount and Cunha.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim, for his part, has maintained he wants Mainoo to stay at Old Trafford. \"I want Kobbie to stay, He needs to fight for his place,\" the boss said.",
      "\"And we need Kobbie, so that is not going to change. I understand that the players that are not playing in this moment are disappointed. Everyone will have the same opportunity to play. You have to fight during the week.\"",
      "Despite the injuries, United claimed a narrow win over Burnley. Bruno Fernandes converted a stoppage-time penalty to settle the clash after the Clarets had trice equalised.",
      "The victory ensures Amorim's side will go into the international break in mid-table, but there has been talk of more transfer business - both ins and outs. A new goalkeeper could yet arrive, while Antony is among the players who could yet leave the club.",
      "\"I was frustrated like any Man Utd fan, we had chances to score more goals, create more chances,\" Amorim told Match of the Day after his team's victory. \"Today, the football was fair - we were the better team.",
      "\"Some moments are really decisive. Sometimes we were not playing so well, but you can see the effort of everyone on the pitch wanting to win.\"",
      "United's first match after the international break is a big one, with Amorim's side taking on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. City will go into the game ahead of United if they avoid defeat on Sunday against Brighton.",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson's legacy as arguably the greatest manager in English football history has only been solidified by Manchester United's dramatic downfall since his retirement.",
      "Since the legendary Scot said goodbye to Old Trafford in 2013, not only have the Red Devils failed to clinch a Premier League title, but a combination of boardroom chaos and dismal on-pitch performances has slowly eroded the aura that Ferguson so meticulously built.",
      "A significant factor in this decline has been poor player recruitment, with United often splashing out exorbitant sums for underperforming stars.",
      "Fans fume at latest VAR controversy as Premier League issue explanation - 'Game's gone'",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma costing PSG millions as Man City stance becomes clear",
      "Despite shelling out over £200million on new talent this summer, United supporters are yet to be convinced that the club's fortunes will change.",
      "Ecuadorian winger Valencia was snapped up after catching Ferguson's eye at Wigan Athletic. Although £16m might seem like a drop in the ocean in today's transfer market, it was a hefty fee at the time.",
      "Valencia, who spent a decade at Old Trafford and played over 300 times, proved to be exceptional value for the money. Initially a right winger, he was converted to a right-back and even captained the side under Jose Mourinho before moving abroad in 2019.",
      "He has since moved into coaching in retirement.",
      "The Canada-born midfielder's career had been plagued by injuries, and his time in the Premier League was no different. Hargreaves managed only 39 appearances across a four-year stint for the Red Devils.",
      "After leaving United, he had a brief spell at Manchester City but played just one Premier League match before being released.",
      "Carrick, most recently the head coach of Middlesbrough, was already considered one of England's best technical midfielders when he was signed by United - and it's fair to say he lived up to the hype.",
      "The former West Ham and Tottenham midfielder evolved as a player over the years after joining in 2006 and even captained the side in the latter stages of his career.",
      "Carrick won five Premier League titles and the Champions League, cementing his place as a club legend by the time he retired after 12 years at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite a shaky start at United, Sir Alex Ferguson's 2011 signing of De Gea turned out to be a masterstroke.",
      "The current Fiorentina star went on to become one of the most outstanding goalkeepers in the club's history, winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award four times.",
      "He clocked up a total of 545 appearances before leaving in the summer of 2023, proving to be an unshakeable presence between the sticks during his prime years.",
      "When it comes to bang for your buck, few on this list can rival De Gea's longevity and success.",
      "During his five-year stint at United, Van Nistelrooy was a goal-scoring powerhouse. Signed from PSV Eindhoven in 2001 for a then-record British fee, the highest praise anyone can give the Dutchman is that he effortlessly filled the boots of Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole.",
      "His tenure at United wasn't as laden with trophies as it coincided with a period of transition for the club, with Arsenal and Chelsea instead taking home the silverware.",

      "He had the opportunity to manage his former club temporarily following Erik ten Hag's exit last year, before a disappointing spell at the helm of Leicester City, who he couldn't prevent from being relegated.",
      "The audacious capture of Arsenal captain Van Persie, right from under their noses, made the Dutch striker one of United's most contentious signings during the Fergie era.",
      "However, fans quickly overlooked his past as the current Feyenoord boss swiftly became a favourite at Old Trafford, still celebrated today for his debut 2012/2013 season.",
      "He scored an impressive 30 goals that year, helping to secure the league title for Ferguson in his final attempt, making him a steal at just £24m. Van Persie continued to spearhead United's attack for another two years before transferring to Fenerbahce.",
      "Rooney was one of English football's brightest talents when he signed for United as a teenager with a hefty £27m fee from his childhood club, Everton. But even then, Ferguson and his team knew they had a gem on their hands.",
      "The England ace became United's top scorer of all time during his 13-year tenure at Old Trafford, netting 253 goals in 559 appearances, surpassing all those who had played before him at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "His managerial career hasn't matched his playing days, though, with Rooney now serving as a pundit on Match of the Day for the BBC.",
      "There are a few flops on this list, but Veron's £28m transfer to United is rightly considered one. The midfielder became England's priciest player back in 2001 but failed to meet expectations during his stint at the club.",
      "Despite struggling to replicate his stunning form from Italy, he made 82 appearances and won the Premier League before moving to Chelsea after two seasons. Veron is still widely recognised as Ferguson's biggest transfer mistake.",
      "He now serves as the chairman of Estudiantes de La Plata in his native Argentina.",
      "Rio Ferdinand became both the world's most expensive defender and the priciest British footballer in history when he moved from United's fierce rivals, Leeds, in 2002.",
      "However, it proved to be money well spent, with Ferdinand establishing himself as one of the greatest defenders of his generation. He spent 12 years at Old Trafford, making over 450 appearances before returning to London to finish his career.",
      "Ferdinand's formidable partnership with Nemanja Vidic was the foundation that allowed United to win the 2008 Champions League and numerous other trophies during some of the best years of Ferguson's lengthy tenure.",
      "He now discusses his former club extensively on his YouTube channel, having left TNT at the end of last season.",
      "But perhaps not everyone knows that, at £31m, the striker is Fergie's most expensive ever signing.",
      "Despite his laid-back and occasionally exasperating style, the former Spurs star was a huge success at Tottenham before being lured away to boost United's attacking prowess.",
      "He scored 56 goals in 149 outings for the Red Devils, clinching two league titles during a four-year spell, before returning to London with Fulham. He now serves as a Betfair ambassador and regularly discusses his former club in the media."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has arrived at the defence of his goalkeepers following their error-strewn start to the season. The Portuguese coach has suggested any critique must be aimed at the whole team with Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir facing a 'difficult job' defending their goal this term.",
      "The Red Devils claimed their first win of the season against Burnley at Old Trafford, but Bayindir could not escape the 3-2 victory without more questions being raised. The 27-year-old was at fault for Jaidon Anthony's goal in the 66th minute which drew the scores level at 2-2.",
      "Bayindir failed to push a save wide which allowed Anthony to take advantage for an equaliser. The mistake follows weak goalkeeping against Arsenal which allowed Riccardo Calafiori's goal and an uncertain performance against Fulham.",
      "Onana dropped to the bench against the Clarets after committing two errors of his own in United's catastrophic defeat against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. But Bayindir's return would not have sparked confidence.",
      "And despite persistent links to a new goalkeeper this summer, Amorim attempted to channel criticism away from his shotstoppers. \"Guys, they are humans,\" said the head coach following the win over Burnley.",
      "\"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",
      "Amorim was happy to gather three points ahead of the international break. United's boss could not help but have some frustration however.",
      "\"It is three points, if you look at the game we should solve it in the first half and control the game - but we are fighting to the last minute because of things we overcomplicate,\" he said.",
      "\"Look at the first half, we have so many chances to score. You feel you can control the game. But one throw in, one set piece. I shook my head, because sometimes football is like this. We now have two weeks with a lot of opportunities. This was a game we had to win, but we have a lot to do.\"",

      "Manchester United are making a shock £40million bid for Aston Villa keeper Emi Martinez. The Reds rejected the chance to sign the Argentine international earlier in the summer when it was deemed that a deal would be too expensive when his £200,000-a-week wages were thrown into the mix.",
      "Instead, United set their sights on Royal Antwerp’s highly-coveted young stopper Senne Lammens, after beating a number of top European rivals for his £20million signature. It was believed that Lammens would be signed before Monday evening’s transfer deadline. The 23-year-old is seen as the man who will replace Thibaut Courtois as Belgium’s No.1.",
      "But United now look ready to sanction a costly short-term solution with Martinez instead of planning for the future. Martinez celebrates his 33rd birthday on Tuesday and his age and combustible character have prompted Villa to look to cash in.",
      "United feel that signing the former Arsenal keeper is a gamble they have to take, even though the club are flirting with PSR problems having already spent more than £200million on new signings this summer.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim does not trust £43million Andre Onana or Turkish back-up Altay Bayindir. Onana was axed from United's team for the 3-2 win over Burnley at Old Trafford after a dodgy display in the shock Carabao Cup exit at Grimsby in midweek.",
      "But Bayindir, who was at fault for Fulham's equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last week, blundered again when the Clarets levelled for a second time.",
      "Interestingly, Villa are themselves looking to make a late deadline-beating move, to take West Ham's Lucas Paqueta to the West Midlands. Unai Emery has been pushing club chiefs to strengthen his squad but PSR issues have meant the Villans haven't been able to add how the Spaniard has wanted.",
      "But having already cashed in on homegrown midfielder Jacob Ramsey, moving out Martinez in the next 36 hours will give them breathing space moving forwards, even as they seek to add Paqueta. They've been holding talks over a loan move with a £50m transfer obligation next summer, and while the Brazil international is keen on the move, West Ham don't like the current terms. Villa being able to pay more cash now and making the transfer permanent from the off would help.",
      "A new goalkeeper would likely also arrive, although Emery may be happy to let new veteran stopper Marco Bizot hold the fort until January if they can't land the replacement for Martinez that they want.",

      "Should all of those leave, it could potentially open the door to more new arrivals for the under-fire Ruben Amorim. A midfielder and a new goalkeeper are potentially on the agenda but some serious work needs to be done for those two signings to be completed.",

      "United striker Rasmus Hojlund is set to bid farewell to Manchester United after agreeing a move to Serie A champions Napoli. The Italian side will sign the Dane on loan with an obligation to buy included in the agreement.",
      "Napoli will hand the Red Devils a £5m loan fee for Hojlund, as part of an overall package that could see United earn more than £43m. The Italian champions would be forced to pay £38m should a number of conditions be met.",
      "Despite that, United would still be in line to lose a huge amount having spent around £72m to sign him from Atalanta. Hojlund, 22, has scored just 26 goals in all competitions since then.",

Speaking on Friday, Wils said: \"Senne is following an individual program, in consultation with all parties. That’s a logical decision. Since this could be a major outgoing transfer, we want to minimise the risk of injuries.\"",

      "Talk was rife inside Old Trafford in the aftermath of the seismic ­Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby on Wednesday night that Amorim might be ready to walk away during the international break regardless of the result against Burnley. That prospect may have subsided for now after the boost of a dramatic first victory of the new season.",

His exit has been on the cards since he grew increasingly exasperated with his role under Ruben Amorim - despite being a regular under the Portuguese for much of last season - and finally spoke out after May's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, a match which he started on the bench.",

And now he has his move, to long-time admirers, with Chelsea having initially sought to do a deal in January. As well as the £40m, United also hold a 10 percent sell-on clause.",

      "Ben Wilkinson was appointed as City U21 boss in 2024 and made a strong start to his tenure last term.",
      "Follow below for live match updates from Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Superb burst from Mather down the left and into the box, but it comes to nothing.",
      "United have been much better at the start of this second half.",
      "J. Fletcher came close to scoring before and that goal could have put the game out of City's reach.",
      "We're back under way for the second half at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "That's the whistle for the break here.",
      "Obi's goal is the difference at the break",
      "Obi pounces on the City defender, bursts into the box and finishes brilliantly.",
      "That's what he can do if he is given a chance in front of goal.",
      "\"Back yourself Bendi, you've got the beaten of him son,\" shouted Binnion earlier.",
      "He wasn't wrong because Mantato just had Noble on toast there.",
      "City have been wasteful and will be really disappointed to go into half-time at 0-0.",
      "Have United weathered the storm? It feels like it.",
      "United have not created a chance in this game and we're almost 30 minutes into the contest.",
      "Binnion is clearly considering making changes at the break. He'll be disappointed with United's start to this game, but City haven't been able to take advantage and the score is level.",
      "City have been much the better side and United are struggling to match their intensity.",
      "Obi hasn't been in the game and is being heavily marked when he picks up the ball.",
      "City should be leading. Devaney just made a wonderful goalline clearance. Armer also made a good block to deny McAidoo's effort.",
      "Binnion is up on his feet and being vocal on the touchline because United are struggling.",
      "McAidoo cut inside and his shot was goalbound, but Armer made a good block to stop it.",
      "Mantato was away on the left wing and the ball should have been played to him.",

      "United are expected to sign goalkeeper Abdulla Al-Hammadi on a free transfer.",

      "The Fletcher twins start for United and the Heskey brothers start for City, which is an interesting sub-plot to the U21 Manchester derby. It should also make you feel old... Darren Fletcher will probably be here to watch the game and I'll keep an eye out for Emile Heskey.",
      "It's interesting to see Mantato at left-back. He's got so much attacking quality that he almost feels wasted in that role, but he does play there for England. Obi is set to lead the attack. The youngster has removed United from his bio on Instagram and might be slightly annoyed at his lack of first-team opportunities after being around the squad last term. Obi is just 17 years old and must earn his stripes.",

We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt has thrown his backing behind head coach Ruben Amorim amid speculation over his future.",
      "United's League Cup elimination by fourth-tier Grimsby Town on Wednesday plunged the club into an early-season crisis but they recovered with a last-gasp 3-2 win against Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "Odds on Amorim to leave United were shortened in midweek and the Portuguese admitted on Friday that \"sometimes I want to quit\", though United sources claimed that was tongue-in-cheek.",
      "Bruno Fernandes converted a 97th-minute penalty to secure United's first win of the campaign against promoted Burnley ahead of the September internationals. United resume their season at Manchester City on September 14.",
      "When asked if he hoped that Amorim would remain in charge, De Ligt replied: “Yeah, of course. I mean, as a player you are responsible for the results.",
      "\"They (outside the club) always speak about the manager, obviously, but I think as players we also looked each other in the eye after Grimsby and said to each other ‘guys, the performance of this week is not acceptable’. It will be really, I think, bad to say that it’s the manager’s fault. It's mostly us and we know that.",
      "\"So yeah, obviously we still stand behind him, and he stands behind us, so we keep going like that. I think the result for today makes that feeling even more.",
      "\"I don't think there's been much said (among the players) because everybody knows how the feeling was. I think everybody from outside could also understand what the feeling is if you lose a game like that.",
      "\"So, yeah, it's not easy. We know that. We were really disappointed, in ourselves especially, so then to win today was I think the only cure that could a little bit help the defeat of Wednesday.",
      "\"I find it quite good (playing under Amorim). I feel good, I feel physically good.\"",
      "United had 20 more attempts at goal than Burnley, who scored twice from six efforts until Jadon Anthony was penalised for tugging Amad's shirt inside the area in added time.",
      "Had Burnley held on, United would have failed to win any of their first three Premier League games for the first time since 2014.",
      "\"I think the only thing that counted today was a win,\" De Ligt added. \"Everybody saw how. We know we could have done that better, but the win was the most important thing.",
      "“I think pretty much that first half was really good. I think we had a lot of big chances. Obviously we had some and we didn't score all of them, but we created a lot of big chances. I think we conceded just one shot from the penalty spot from Hannibal, so that was really good.",
      "\"The only thing is that the game is 90 minutes, today even more, so that's something that we have to improve on. As I said, today the only thing that counted was a win so with that I am really happy.\"",
      "Fernandes missed from 12 yards in the 1-1 draw with Fulham last week but converted both kicks in the marathon shootout defeat at Grimsby before notching his 39th penalty goal for United against Burnley.",
      "“I couldn't do it, I think, as a penalty taker,\" De Ligt said of Fernandes' calmness. “Really happy with Bruno today that he stepped up to the penalty and that he scored a goal. It is really important for us.\"",

      "Hello and welcome to our live updates on the latest Manchester United transfer news, views and gossip on Saturday, August 30.",
      "The summer transfer window is due to officially shut on Monday (September 1) at 7pm. United know they need to move quickly to wrap up any remaining deals - and it seems their next summer signing could be just around the corner.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens looks set to make his switch to M16 after missing his team's match against Westerlo on Saturday. The 22-year-old is expected to complete a £17million transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "This purchase is likely to cast further uncertainty over the futures of both Andre Onana and Altay Bayındır. United had also been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma, but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper now appears set for Manchester City.",
      "The Reds have also been heavily linked with a move for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, although Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler has once again insisted that the Cameroonian is not departing.",
      "In other news, Reds skipper Bruno Fernandes continues to be a target for clubs in Saudi Arabia, while the futures of Antony, Jadon Sancho, and Rasmus Hojlund remain uncertain.",
      "Stay tuned for all the latest from Old Trafford throughout the day....",
      "It's all haappening and it's looking better for Man United.",
      "Fabrizio Romano is now reporting that Aston Villa have made a formal approach to Royal Antwerp to sign Senne Lammens.",
      "It's said he is the main option alongside Diogo Costa to replace Emiliano Martinez, if he leaves for Manchester United.",
      "Leeds United have emerged as a late contender to sign Man United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo before the window slams shut.",
      "Former goalkeeper Paul Robinson has claimed the England international would be a 'statement signing' for the Whites. Speaking to MOT Leeds News, he said:“ There was talk about him signing a new contract, then there was talk of him moving on, and then the word that was coming out was he’s getting his head down, working hard and concentrating on Manchester United.",
      "“I think it would be a difficult deal to do because of the relationship and the feeling between the two clubs. It’s sometimes hard to win over a set of fans. I don’t see it being an easy deal to do.",
      "“Would it be a quality addition? Yes, it would absolutely be a quality addition, but I think there are just too many things that trip this deal up.”",
      "Manchester United are continuing talks in an attempt to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp.",
      "Lammens has been left out of successive Royal Antwerp squads and discussions with United continue. The goalkeeper has not agreed personal terms, but it's hoped a breakthrough can be reached.",
      "Galatasaray have been linked with a move for the Belgian shot-stopper ahead of the deadline.",

      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United will assess injuries to Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount after winning against Burnley.",
      "Cunha was forced off in the first half against the Clarets with what seemed to be a hamstring injury. Mount was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at the interval after also picking up an injury.",
      "Speaking at his post-match press conference, United boss Ruben Amorim provided an update on the pair and said: \"I don't know [how they are]. We'll check them. We need those guys really bad to be competitive.\"",
      "Read more here",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has completed his move from Manchester United to Chelsea.",
      "The winger was at Stamford Bridge to watch his new club beat Fulham in Saturday's early Premier League game and has wrapped up his £40million switch.",
      "Garnacho's move to Chelsea has been expected for most of the summer and the Blues have been long-term admirers of the 21-year-old.",
      "Read more here",
      "The Athletic's has provided an update on United's transfer plans ahead of Monday's deadline",
      "\"They've clearly got a bit of an issue in terms of whether there's a market for Andre Onana. It doesn't seem to be the case at the moment, you never know before the deadline. Maybe more plausible, you can move on Altay Bayindir there, but he's playing at the moment.",
      "\"It's plausible more than one comes in but that would give them an excess of goalkeepers, then they really have the issue of the Africa Cup of Nations on the horizon, and they want to upgrade in that area that's been long understood. And so Senne Lammens of Royal Antwerp is a player they've looked at and have aninterest in, I don't think the situation has ever been as advanced as some have suggested, but let's see what develops on that front.",
      "\"And then of course there are continued reports around Emi Martinez, who they made a loan inquiry for earlier in the window. It didn't develop then. Let's see if it does now. The suggestion from Villa until this point has been they expect Emi Martinez to stay despite what we saw from him at the end of last season in that very emotional scene on the pitch that looked like a departure was coming.",
      "\"So yeah, there could be a bit of activity in that area for Man United. The midfield is of interest whether there could a last minute loan or they stick with their current options. So United are one of course to keep an eye on.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has explained why he overlooked £66million striker signing Benjamin Sesko when Mathues Cunha was forced off injured against Burnley.",
      "Cunha went down in the first half during Saturday's 3-2 Premier League win over the Clarets and was replaced by Joshua Zirkee, with Sesko remaining on the bench.",
      "The Slovenia striker did come on in the second period, replacing Casemiro with just under 20 minutes remaining. Amorim's handling of Sesko has also been a talking point this season. United paid big money to sign Sesko from RB Leipzig, but the striker has yet to start in a Premier League fixture.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United needed a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes to see off Burnley at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "The 3-2 victory over Scott Parker's team will come as some relief for Reds boss Ruben Amorim after Wednesday night's dismal League Cup exit to Grimsby Town. United were twice pegged back by the newly promoted Clarets but Reds captain Fernandes stepped up to net a late winner from the spot after Amad was fouled in the Burnley box.",
      "Amorim's men will now head into the international break and will return with daunting fixtures against rivals Manchester City and Chelsea. They then face kinder matches on paper against Brentford and Sunderland before a tough trip to Liverpool.",
      "Here is a look at what the national media had to say after United's win over Burnley.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly preparing a surprise £40million offer for Aston Villa's goalkeeper Emi Martinez. The Reds had previously passed up the opportunity to sign the Argentine international earlier in the summer, deeming the deal too costly when his £200,000-a-week wages were considered.",
      "Instead, United turned their attention to Royal Antwerp's highly sought-after young goalkeeper Senne Lammens, having outbid several top European competitors for his £20million signature. It was anticipated that Lammens would be signed before Monday evening's transfer deadline.",
      "The 23-year-old is viewed as the successor to Thibaut Courtois as Belgium's No. 1. However, United now appear ready to approve an expensive short-term solution with Martinez rather than plan for the future.",
      "Read more here",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was \"really happy\" to score his first goal for Manchester United on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo was signed for £65million, plus £6m in add-ons, from Brentford this summer. The forward notched 20 goals in the Premier League last season and got off the mark in the top flight for United against Burnley.",
      "The Cameroon international scored with a simple finish to make it 2-1 in the second half, netting almost immediately after Lyle Foster had equalised for Burnley at the Stretford End.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United forward Antony has posted an update on social media as his move to Real Betis stalls.",
      "The Brazilian has been training away from United's first team this summer after asking to leave Old Trafford. Antony spent the second half of last season on loan at Betis, scoring nine goals and providing five assists in 26 appearances.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of Manchester United this morning.",
      "The Reds finally got their first win of the season yesterday with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley at Old Trafford. Those three points will come as a relief to Ruben Amorim and his team.",

      "Stick with us throughout the day for all the latest.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has completed his move to Chelsea and has signed a long-term contract at the club.",
      "The Blues have paid around £35m for the winger.",
      "We will bring you the reaction...",
      "The Mirror claims Napoli have prepared a four-year contract for Mainoo, who has reputedly informed United that he wants a permanent move to Serie A.",
      "However, United have so far resisted the deal, wary of a repeat of Scott McTominay’s remarkable resurgence after leaving the club.",
      "Elsewhere, Fabrizio Romano claims that Mainoo once again asked United about the possibility of a loan move in the final 48 hours of the summer transfer window.",
      "The Athletic's David Ornstein has provided an update on Lammens.",
      "Ornstein said: \"Lammens is a player of interest but it's not as advanced as some people have suggested. They've also got an issue there, can they move on Andre Onana, it doesn't look like it.",
      "\"Altay Bayindir, possibly, so that's one to watch before the deadline.\"",
      "Hojlund is set to join Napoli on a season-long, with includes an obligation to buy.",
      "Hojlund was axed from Ruben Amorim's plans despite featuring in pre-season. Speaking in the USA, Hojlund outlined his desire to fight for his place but was subsequently omitted from the squad against Arsenal, Fulham and Grimsby.",
      "Read more here.",
      "ABC Sevilla report that after a preliminary agreement on €25m, Man United requested that Betis cover an additional €6m, believed to be owed to Antony and his agents.",
      "They add that Betis will not resubmit their offer until Antony and United have reached an agreement on the €6m, and they do not wish to be involved in those discussions. Meanwhile, Estadio Deportivo wrote: \"Just when the negotiation was considered finalised, everything went up in smoke again due to a small print regarding amounts owed to the Brazil international that Old Trafford is trying to foist on the Verdiblancos, a position they are, quite literally, incapable of assuming.Everyone is confident that it will eventually happen, but the news as of August 30th is that there is still no agreement.\"",
      "Sport Mediaset report that Sancho appears unlikely to play again in 2025.",
      "They suggest he could remain at Old Trafford beyond the summer window, even though he is aware he would have little to no chance of featuring under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Speaking to the media on Friday, relayed by TuttoMercatoWeb, he said: \"Call him if you have his number… You know everything, I don’t know what the margins are now. We don’t have to beg anyone, ever: it applies to everyone, Sancho is a possibility, but we are a possibility for him. If they don’t think so, he’ll stay where he is.\"",
      "Sport Mediaset adds that the manager’s comments were the ‘final nail in the coffin’ for Sancho, but the Serie A club have other plans. Roma are said to be 'making one last push to sign him' and are expected to contact his agent within the next few hours.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says a verbal agreement between all parties has been reached for the transfer of Hojlund to Napoli.",
      "\"Rasmus Hojlund to Napoli, here we go!,\" he wrote on X. \"Verbal agreement done between all parties involved.",
      "\"Loan deal for €6m fee with buy option clause to become mandatory under certain conditions worth €44m. Hojlund said yes to Napoli days ago, set for medical in next 24h.\"",
      "Sesko, along with several other Man United players, has dropped a team news hint ahead of their clash with Burnley.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are still in search of their first victory in the Premier League following a defeat and draw to Arsenal and Fulham respectively. The match at Old Trafford will be their final one before the September international break.",
      "Ahead of this afternoon's match, Sesko has posted a pre-match graphic preview of the fixture to his Instagram story. Historically this suggests that the 22-year-old striker, whom United signed from RB Leipzig, will be involved in some capacity.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Inter Milan have reportedly joined the race to sign Jadon Sancho. TEAMtalkclaim the Italian giants are looking to reinforce their attack before the window closes.",
      "The 25-year-old has been linked with AS Roma recently, but he has yet to complete his move to Italy. Sancho is currently training away from United's first team with the former Borussia Dortmund star keen to leave Old Trafford this summer.",
      "Read more here",
      "Had the clash with Grimsby gone according to plan from the start, there is a strong likelihood Bryan Mbeumo would have remained on the bench. However, Amorim had to call upon him at half-time and he got United back into the game with his first goal for the club.",
      "Fellow summer signings Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko started at Blundell Park, highlighting the level of quality United had on the pitch, but they were, just like the rest of their teammates, largely ineffective.",
      "Nevertheless, they have been brought to Old Trafford to try and increase United's attacking output, meaning Amorim must persevere with them. With that said, the time has come for him to deploy Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko as a front-three from the start for the first time.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United have just a week left to strengthen their squad before the summer transfer window closes at 7pm on Monday, September 1.",
      "It may be early days in the 2025/26 campaign, but all evidence so far suggests that the Reds still have plenty of work to do. That will surprise few after such a disastrous campaign last term, and yet the scale of United's rebuild often causes astonishment.",
      "The key areas that need filling are goalkeeper and a new central midfielder, with both positions exposed in the two Premier League matches Ruben Amorim's side have played so far. Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have both struggled over the last year or so, and there will be hope that Senne Lammens can step up if his move from Royal Antwerp is completed.",

      "Mainoo broke through as one of Europe's brightest talents under Erik ten Hag in 2023/24. The midfielder scored in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City before earning a call-up to Gareth Southgate's England squad for Euro 2024 where he started in the final against Spain.",
      "But the 20-year-old has struggled for game time since Ruben Amorim replaced Ten Hag at Old Trafford in November last year.

      "However, it's worth noting that Brighton are reportedly keen to retain the Cameroon international for at least another year and have reportedly slapped a price tag of more than £100million on him. And Brighton's firm stance has been reinforced by their decision to name him in their starting line-up for Sunday afternoon's clash at home to Manchester City.",

      "Manchester United won 3-2 against Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim was placed under huge pressure after losing to Grimsby Town earlier in the week, and knew he needed to secure a win against the Clarets ahead of the international break.",
      "Burnley thought they would leave Old Trafford with a point having twice equalised, but Amad was brought down in added time to win a penalty. Bruno Fernandes converted and Old Trafford breathed a sigh of relief at the whistle.",
      "Here are the moments you might have missed.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the game. Banners and flags were unfurled, and one flag had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction after Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the text. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around,\" to the tune of Bonnie Tyler.",
      "Amorim sounded like he was close to tendering his resignation after the Grimsby defeat. Some fans voiced understandable concerns about the 40-year-old, but he still retains support from matchgoing fans.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee quickly picked up the ball while VAR decided whether to award a late penalty to United. The Dutchman handed it over to Fernandes, who paced around the box as he tried to focus his mind.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty against Fulham last weekend and atoned for that miss to secure an important three points. It was only a win against Burnley, but it was crucial after the Grimsby debacle.",
      "United's captain screamed in relief at full-time and was embraced by Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United had enough chances to put the result beyond doubt in the first half. But they never make it easy for themselves and could not extend their advantage.",
      "Burnley equalised in the 55th minute, but Mbeumo produced an immediate response to score his first league goal for United. Mbeumo was mobbed by his attacking colleagues, while Amorim did not raise a smile. He knew there was more work to do and buried his head in his hands shortly afterwards when Fernandes dragged a shot wide.",
      "United's head coach knew his side needed a two-goal lead because, more often than not, they allow their opponent back into the contest. And Amorim's fears were realised when Jaidon Anthony scored to make it 2-2.",
      "The cameras in the press box showed Omar Berrada looking unhappy in the directors' box. Amorim subsequently blew out his cheeks and could hardly watch as Fernandes stepped up to convert a late penalty.",
      "Shortly after United opened the scoring against Burnley, Cunha went down with an injury.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee were sent to warm up. Cunha returned to the dressing room with what seemed to be a hamstring issue and was consoled by the substitutes at the tunnel entrance.",
      "Cunha was applauded by supporters as he headed down the tunnel and his body language hinted he might be out for several weeks, which would be a huge blow for United.",
      "The Brazilian has made a strong impression since signing from Wolves. It felt like only a matter of time before Cunha would score his first United goal, but it seems he will be unavailable in the coming weeks.",
      "Mount had a brilliant five minutes in the first half. He tracked back to recover the ball to create a chance for Mbeumo and did the same moments later when setting up the Cameroon international again.",
      "Mbeumo came close to scoring on both occasions but could not find the back of the net, so Mount took matters into his own hands minutes later and made a piercing run into the Burnley penalty area.",
      "Kyle Walker appeared to bring Mount to the ground and the referee pointed for a penalty. Mount celebrated winning the spot kick to the Stretford End, but his celebrations were premature.",
      "The incident was reviewed by VAR. The referee announced it was not a foul when the presumption was it had been reviewed to determine whether it was a penalty or a free-kick. It was a bizarre decision from VAR and Mount deserved something for his good work.",
      "Mount was excellent in the first half but was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo at the interval. Mount must have picked up an injury because, based on his performance, Amorim wouldn't have brought him off.",
      "Mainoo's future has made headlines this week. The youngster's contract situation has stalled and there are doubts about where he fits into Amorim's system, so it's not a surprise that he wants to leave on loan.",
      "The academy graduate wants minutes and Amorim has said he is challenging Fernandes for a place in the starting team. Fans are concerned that Mainoo could eventually leave on a permanent basis and Old Trafford gave a deliberately loud cheer for the 20-year-old when he was introduced.",

Amorim has watched his goalkeepers make mistakes against Arsenal, Grimsby and Burnley this term, but defended his 'keepers after the win over the Clarets, insisting it's hard to be a goalkeeper in this current United side.",
      "\"Guys, they are humans,\" said Amorim. \"Manchester United, everything is in use. Everybody talks about the goalkeeper. And you can see, I can change the goalkeeper in the situations that happen.",
      "\"We are in that moment. I think it is hard to be a Manchester United goalkeeper in this moment. But if you look at the first goal, we can defend it better. We suffered a quite similar goal against Fulham, because we don't do the full rotation of the team when the ball is on the other side.",
      "\"All these small things have nothing to do with the goalkeeper. So, the players are struggling a little bit with all the things around the club. That is normal. So it's not just the goalkeepers. I think everybody has to improve.\"",

      "\"The sound of the fans when we are pressing and winning balls and corners, and you sprint to get a corner, you sprint to get a throw in, it's nothing to do with the tactical and technical aspects. So today, I just need to watch sometimes the first minutes to understand the mindset of the team.\"",

      "14-year-old goalscoring prodigy JJ Gabriel is making serious waves at Manchester United, with supporters urging for the 'star boy' to be promoted to the first team as soon as possible and to be 'protected at all costs'.",
      "The young Red Devil left fans in awe with his performance in Saturday's under-18s Premier League match, where United claimed a 4-0 victory over Derby County. The teenager netted a hat-trick within 22 minutes, scoring in the fifth, 14th and 27th minutes to fire his side into a 3-0 lead before the half-hour mark.",
      "Amir Ibragimov, 17, scored the other goal from a penalty in the 66th minute, but all eyes were on young Gabriel. Supporters took to social media to hail the young forward's weekend performance, with one predicting he will become United's new star boy following Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea.",
      "They said: \"Chelsea took our egotistic Garnacho away, but La Carrington is cooking another starboy, his name is JJ Gabriel, bagged a hat-trick today. He's just 14!\"",
      "Another fan said: \"How did I forget my star boy JJ Gabriel? Invest your stocks now!\" while a third added: \"JJ Gabriel has a hat-trick in 27 minutes for Manchester United Under 18's against Derby. He is 14 years old. Protect him at all costs.\"",
      "With growing demands for the Old Trafford hierarchy to \"protect\" the young player, it appears the top brass are way ahead and have already taken action. Gabriel secured his future with United this summer and is expected to remain at Old Trafford until he reaches 16, when he becomes eligible to sign a professional contract with the club.",
      "As revealed earlier this month, the teenager, nicknamed 'Kid Messi', is set to be called up to first-team training this season. Gabriel and his family were recently introduced to Ruben Amorim, while the highly-rated youngster was also invited to watch United's game against Arsenal in the directors' box after he committed his future to the club.",
      "Technical director Jason Wilcox is believed to have played a key role in persuading the teenager to remain at United after arranging a meeting with manager Amorim at the training facility to make him feel more included within the squad.",
      "Whilst it's not uncommon for academy prospects to train with the senior team - and occasionally progress early to become vital members of the starting eleven - the fact Gabriel is already creating a stir at merely 14 years old indicates his potential could be extraordinarily high.",
      "Gabriel will not feature in United's campaign for the FA Youth Cup this season, however, as participants must be born before the cut-off date of 31 August 2010.",
      "The young forward, who is the son of former Republic of Ireland international Joe O'Cearuill, has netted five goals in three outings for the under-18s side already this season. This includes the hat-trick against Derby and goals against Middlesbrough and Everton.",
      "During the previous campaign, the youngster scored three times in as many outings, impressing fans with his flair, technical ability, and finishing prowess despite his tender years.",
      "Certain United supporters have compared him to Barcelona's Lamine Yamal, with one enthusiastic fan writing at the weekend: \"JJ Gabriel is a different level of talent. Man Utd must try to keep him at all costs. I can see why Barcelona want him. He could be an LW version of Yamal in the future.\"",
      "Another supporter said: \"I really hope that we can hold onto JJ Gabriel - he looks amazing and is only 14. There is a lot of chatter that he may move on. As he's an Irish passport holder, he could join the likes of Barcelona now.\"",
      "Given Gabriel's Irish passport status, the 14-year-old would be permitted to transfer to a European side at 16 rather than waiting until 18. This had attracted interest from the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich before United convinced him to stay.",

      "Manchester United forward Matheus Cunha has been spotted leaving Old Trafford walking freely - despite being forced off in the first half of their 3-2 win over Burnley on Saturday.",
      "The Reds earned their first win of the season against the newly-promoted side, owing to Bruno Fernandes' injury-time winner. Ruben Amorim's men were twice pegged back by the Clarets after an own goal from Josh Cullen and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "However, in the first half, Cunha was forced off with what appeared to be a hamstring injury in the 31st minute.",
      "The Brazilian was replaced by Joshua Zirkzee before heading straight down the tunnel.",
      "Speaking after the final whistle, Amorim admitted his concern at the forward's injury. \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury,\" the United head coach said.",
      "Asked if they were long-term issues, he replied: \"I don't know, I don't know but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",
      "In the aftermath of the game, Cunha was spotted walking outside of Old Trafford freely.",
      "A video surfaced online of the forward looking fine and smiling to fans as he made his way out of the car park.",
      "Cunha has, meanwhile, been named in Brazil's World Cup qualifiers next month by Carlo Ancelotti. The five-time world champions take on Chile on September 5, before facing Bolivia five days later.",
      "United will be hoping that Cunha is okay to face Manchester City in two weeks' time.",

      "Ruben Amorim has refused to promise that he will remain in charge of Manchester United after the September international break.",
      "League Two Grimsby Town eliminated United from the League Cup 12-11 in a penalty shootout on Wednesday night, having led 2-0 until the 75th minute in the 2-2 draw. That prompted an emotional post-match assessment from Amorim, who admitted \"something has to change\".",
      "United host Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday before the first round of internationals this season and resume their campaign against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on September 14.",
      "Amorim said at his pre-match press conference that \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\", a comment that United sources claimed was tongue in cheek and a rationale for his emotional nature after matches.",
      "The United head coach is expected to hold further discussions with members of the club's leadership team during the internationals. United usually start planning for the summer transfer window the following year in September.",
      "Amorim said during pre-season that to \"walk away is more an ego thing\". When asked if he can say with absolute certainty that he will be the United manager after the international break, Amorim replied: \"I don't know what is going to happen. That is my idea [to stay], but again, I am not going to promise you nothing, what is going to be the future.",
      "\"But I'm the manager of Manchester United and I think that is not going to change. I said that sometimes there is an ego thing, I don't say that I will put my ego to a part, or in front. You were there, and you understand.",
      "\"Guys, I'm being honest with you, sometimes I'm so frustrated with the team that I think in one thing, and then I return to my normal behaviour! So I will not promise you that.",
      "\"I will live this day by day, so I'm tired of saying that I'm not going to behave like this or that. I'm going to be myself and I have a lot of passion and I want to succeed more than anyone.\"",
      "Amorim stressed he remains confident that he is the right man to make United a credible force again but that he was \"shocked\" by the level of performance at Blundell Park.",
      "\"Yes (I am confident). It depends on the day!\" he laughed. \"But I'm confident because I saw these players play really well in tough matches and I see it in training, the training is so much better.",
      "\"I was not surprised, I was shocked in the last game, I was shocked. That's why you see that game, this is not our team, the way we are doing things.",
      "\"So I'm always confident in the way I manage the team. And then I'm trying to remind myself if Bruno (Fernandes) scores that penalty (at Fulham), if we have three first opportunities against Fulham, we score a goal. Things will be really different.",
      "\"And sometimes it's that small difference that changes the narrative and you can see it in one week, it looks like a different club.",
      "\"There's no excuse (for the Grimsby debacle), because I didn't put just 11 players that don't play so much, they played in pre-season, it was not just guys that are from the academy, a mix, no, it was in the right position.",
      "\"I could play that team the next game. We had Kobbie (Mainoo), Manu (Ugarte), Harry Maguire, (Matheus) Cunha, (Benjamin) Sesko, Amad, Diogo (Dalot), Patrick (Dorgu). So that is the frustration of a coach, so that's why it's hard.",
      "\"I don't know what happened, but in the normal day, so much better.\"",
      "Amorim was in a jocular mood at his pre-match press conference, despite the humiliation at Grimsby. He admitted sometimes \"I just need 10 minutes with myself alone\" to talk him out of quitting.",
      "\"I don't need anyone, but I'm going to be like that. When you say I want to quit, it's that, 'f*****g, I want to quit, I don't love the players'. I hate sometimes my kids, so I'm going to be like that! That is not going to change.",
      "\"Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a funny thing, I'm going to suffer. We just need to win some games. So we cannot change that fact. We need to focus on the next game, and if we start winning, things are going to be easier to do.\"",

The first 3 games of his first full season ended in a win, loss and a draw – including a 2-0 loss to Burnley. It took him 3 years to bring in Salah, VVD and a proper keeper in Alisson. It took him 4 years to win a trophy.",
      "I have no strength at the minute to respond in detail to the uneducated idiots who proclaim that the formation or system, of 3 at the back, is the issue. The last time City won the league, they were effectively playing a formation that consisted of 3 at the back (3–2-4-1 with inverted fullbacks). Ruben needs time to tweak his system to adapt it to the PL, in the same way that any manager new to the league does.",

      "Nick Woltemade: From Bundesliga Bench to Tyneside Dreams (A Black-and-White Fantasy)\nI write to you today as a concerned football fan and part-time emotional support therapist for long-suffering Newcastle supporting friends regarding the growing whispers of Nick Woltemade being eyed as *the* solution to their striker shortage.",
      "Let’s be honest here. Nick Woltemade sounds less like a centre-forward and more like a password you’d get if you smashed your forehead against the keyboard while trying to log into Football Manager after three pints. Yes, he’s tall. Yes, he’s German. But we’ve all seen this movie before—and no, I’m not talking about the 2014 World Cup Final. I’m talking about **“The Obertan Illusion: Part Deux.”**",
      "This smells like what happened when Sir Alex Ferguson (usually a man of genius) decided that **Manucho**—a name that still haunts Old Trafford like a forgotten MySpace login—was going to be the next big thing. Tall? Check. Foreign? Check. Scored once in Angola? Triple check. Manucho had all the hype and none of the Premier League minutes. Sound familiar?",
      "Now, I’m not saying Woltemade will definitely follow in Manucho’s footsteps and disappear into a Bundesliga B team before we can finish pronouncing his name. But in the harsh light of Premier League reality, signing him to solve their goal-scoring crisis feels less like a bold footballing move and more like a deleted scene from 8½, where the director is spiralling into madness trying to find meaning in a striker with two career goals and the gait of a confused giraffe.",
      "Let me be clear: this isn’t anti-Woltemade propaganda. It’s just that Newcastle need a proven striker, not someone who sounds like he moonlights as a Berlin-based techno DJ on weekends.",
      "If the plan is to sign Nick Woltemade to “develop for the future,” then fine—but don’t pretend he’s the cavalry. That’d be like sending in a kazoo to back up the brass section. And let’s face it, if Nick really was the answer, we’d all be asking a much stranger question.",

The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",

      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",

Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.

They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",

      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",

      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",

      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Always felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",

Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",

      "Feels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",

      "Ruben Amorim is under increasing pressure at Manchester United with rising concerns of another botched summer at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim’s side have no win from their first three games of the season, with the penalty shootout defeat at Grimsby in the Carabao a stunning nadir for team and manager. The sight of him, 2-0 down to League Two opposition and fiddling about with magnets on his tactics board, already has a McClaren’s Umbrella feel to it.",
      "If Amorim is done for, the next question becomes who could take over at Manchester United? We have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund boss was high in the reckoning for the Tottenham job, mostly we suspect because he is available. The same criteria could get him the nod here, and it’s fair to say that former Dortmund bosses have generally done okay in Our League.",
      "",
      "Has done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should, they definitely won’t.",
      "",
      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until next summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",
      "",
      "",
      "Has extended his Germany contract until after Euro 2028, which would appear to rule him out, but the lure of the elite club game can be strong and Nagelsmann in the Premier League has long felt inevitable somewhere down the line.",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an “interesting” club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Backed in over recent days as talk continues to swirl around his Nottingham Forest future. He’s a fine manager, but we simply cannot see United going for this at all. Especially given how his previous attempt to manage a Big Six banter club turned out.",
      "",
      "Would ‘knows the club’ trump the fact that Carrick has not long been sacked by a Championship club? It didn’t work out brilliantly for Frank Lampard at Chelsea, but it remains a curiously beguiling CV booster even at the very heftiest of clubs.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",
      "Southgate has been pretty clear about feeling mighty comfortable about never taking another managerial job. That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "That FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has taken the Austrian high up all the lists, and now right to the very top of the silliest of all of them with Spurs off the table for at least the next few months.",

      "The Saturday 3pm slot has been decimated and desecrated more than ever this Premier League season, but it refuses to go quietly.",
      "The third Saturday of the season delivered in style, with a thrilling late win for Sunderland, a desperate face-saving late win for Burnley, the sight of Jack Grealish falling in love with football again in real time, and Spurs crashing Spursily back down to earth with a shocking performance in defeat at home to Bournemouth, who somehow keep on trucking despite having the heart ripped out of their team over the summer.",
      "Andoni Iraola might just be a genius, while Ruben Amorim looks more lucky general after a late VAR intervention spared United more blushes after a truly mortifying week.",
      "Here’s the F365 3pm Blackout on a belting afternoon of fun and games…",
      "It says a great deal about Manchester United these days that even when you sit and ponder what a 97th-minute winner might mean as a sliding doors moment for club, player and manager you still come to the conclusion ‘Probably not much’.",
      "There just seems too much too fundamentally broken at Old Trafford – literally and figuratively – for a spawny late home win over a promoted side to mark any kind of significant corner-turning. It will mean slightly less noise and attention through the international break – and gratitude must be extended from one banter club to another here as Spurs gamely take on the mantle after a truly abysmal effort against Bournemouth – but we’ve been here so many times with United, under so many managers.",
      "It’s not even the first time Ruben Amorim’s team have performed absurd acts of late escapology; it’s never really amounted to anything much before, it’s unlikely to do so now. The sheer amount of times they get themselves into these situations remains more compelling than the admittedly often eye-catching times they manage to extract themselves.",
      "But that doesn’t mean it isn’t important. Relegation six-pointers are always big games, and at the end of the day it doesn’t really matter how you win them.",
      "But this was about as unconvincing a win as it’s possible to imagine against a team that had been so thoroughly sorted out on their previous away day. And by United’s banter-club rivals to boot.",
      "Twice Burnley were able to peg United back after falling behind, exposing yet again the fragility at the heart of this team.",
      "The slapstick nature of United’s first goal – ricocheting home off the unfortunate Josh Cullen – and cruelty of the winner, a penalty awarded by VAR in the very last moments of added time, will also temper any talk of this being a game that marks a significant piece of actual progress or development for United.",
      "They have avoided further humiliation at the end of a week that has contained a season’s worth of it already. But no more than that.",
      "",
      "Another late, late Wilson Isidor goal at the Stadium of Light and, while the gloss-applier in a thumping win over West Ham was certainly enjoyable this one might just carry a bit more weight in the final analysis.",
      "Having fallen behind in the 77th minute, to emerge from this game with all three points is a seismic effort from Regis Le Bris’ play-off winners. It also marks a second home win for them against teams among the more obviously vulnerable of the previously Settled Seventeen.",
      "Nothing looks settled now with all three promoted sides showing they are ready and willing to compete. The idea of it being impossible to do so has already been slightly exposed, while it also seems relevant to note that not one of the six teams to perform the promotion-relegation double in the last couple of years has subsequently looked out of place in the Championship.",
      "The fear of a new normal was valid, with each passing season only helping the sides already in place get more and more comfortable, but it really is starting to look more quirk than permanent arrangement, a combination of an undeniable strengthening of the lower reaches of the Premier League with a series of painfully ill-equipped promoted sides.",
      "With all three promoted sides showing their teeth after a summer where the Premier League’s big beasts have shamelessly feasted on the rest, neither of those factors appears to be in play this season. Which could make for an awful lot of fun.",
      "",
      "One of the great features of Spursiness is the way it so often seems to be specifically designed to torture the club’s fans into genuine madness.",
      "And they do love to make sure the whiplash is as severe as possible when the rug is pulled from under a fanbase the club itself seems to genuinely despise. Two wins from two had been followed by the sort of statement signing that prompts inevitable overexcitement.",
      "Xavi Simons was in the building but unavailable, on precisely the sort of occasion where precisely his sort of football was required. Yet if Spurs could just find a way past Bournemouth they would have likely gone into the international break top of the league and full of joy.",
      "Long-term Spurs watchers will be ahead of us here, but those two words ‘international break’ are enough to tell you that simply couldn’t happen.",
      "Spurs have now ensured their supporters have spent the last seven international breaks stewing on a defeat – and usually a particularly wretched one. The last time they won directly before an international break was a scarcely deserved 1-0 win in October 2023 against Luton, who have since been relegated twice.",
      "Since then, Spurs have lost before international breaks to Wolves (from 1-0 up at 90 minutes), Fulham (3-0), Newcastle, Brighton (from 2-0 up at half-time), Ipswich (at home), Fulham (again) and now Bournemouth in a game that should have ended far more compellingly than 1-0 to the visitors such was their dominance.",
      "Andoni Iraola’s side controlled the game to an astonishing degree after a half-awake Spurs defence with Cristian Romero inattentive and a dawdling Djed Spence playing Evanilson onside to score what would prove to be the only goal.",
      "That it remained the only goal was mostly down to a lack of clinical finishing from the visitors, because Spurs created nothing.",
      "Iraola really is a genius; to have had the heart ripped out of his defence the way he has this summer and then set his team up to so utterly nullify Spurs was a huge achievement, even allowing for the role Spurs played in their own downfall by appearing to regard such concepts as ‘ideas’ or ‘movement’ as essentially cheating.",
      "This was a world away from the varied but excellent performances under Thomas Frank against PSG, Burnley and Man City, and a perhaps necessary reality check for just how far off proper, sensible clubs last year’s 17th-place finishers remain.",
      "By the time Spurs mustered their first shot of any kind just before the hour mark, Bournemouth had already had 15. The final tally, even as Spurs threw players and long balls into the penalty area with increasing frequency and desperation, still read an absurd 19-5 in Bournemouth’s favour.",
      "Not one of Spurs’ efforts troubled Bournemouth. All of Spurs’ effort will have troubled Spurs.",
      "",
      "A happy Jack Grealish is something surely all of us can get behind. Okay, maybe not Wolves fans.",
      "But for the rest of us there is undoubted joy in watching him simply Enjoying His Football again as he took his assist tally for the season to four with two more in an entertaining win over Wolves. Some players really are just more effective as the brightest shining light in a more ordinary team than as another cog in a brilliant machine.",
      "There’s no shame in that. There’s nothing wrong with that. And Grealish is one such player. He doesn’t turn 30 until next month; there really could be an awful lot left to come in a career that now has all the baubles and trimmings of being part of Man City’s stunning run of recent success.",
      "But one suspects that what Grealish might achieve at Everton might just bring him far more joy than trophies and medals ever could. Although he might miss the parades."

      "",
      "The signing of Nick Woltemade means Newcastle are very unlikely to bring in Strand Larsen, with Wolves always deeply reluctant to sanction any move. Wolves boss Vitor Pereira is not ruling out his departure, though, and Craig Hope reported on Friday that the striker isn’t playing against Everton this weekend, which certainly adds fuel to the fire, while not aligning with the club’s stance on his exit. Maybe they’re just waiting for the window to close and for this all to blow over after the player’s ‘polite’ request to be sold. But he’s just too similar to Woltemade and Yoane Wissa is a more realistic option.",

Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement.

The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend.",

      "Romano wrote: “No medical, no travel imminent for Antony at this stage as Real Betis and Manchester United are still negotiating. Details of permanent move, 50% sell-on clause, salary, exit conditions being discussed. Betis on it with their best efforts but still waiting for green light.”",
      "And an official statement from Betis soon followed, confirming not only that no agreement had been reached but that they have ‘withdrawn the offer’ for the 25-year-old.",

      "Plenty of you believe Ruben Amorim should either resign or be sacked, with three replacements touted in the Mailbox, but he’s also not the problem in the minds of many, and as we all struggle to come up with a solution to a broken Manchester United, there’s one obvious fix.",
      "There’s also a bit of Newcastle anger at Liverpool and some Champions League frustration, but this is indeed another Amorim, Manchester United edition.",
      "Send your thoughts on the Old Trafford mess or anything else to theeditor@football365.com.",

      "There’s something fundamentally wrong about the United spirit. It’s bigger than squad revamp, or structural development. It’s the psyche.\nIn the Fergie era, playing against a team with John O’Shea and Fredrico Macheda, you still held your breath, knowing that United were capable of springing up surprises.",
      "Since Fergie’s departure, there’s a kind of trepidation coaches face with managing the team. Every coach since then, has tried to pick out scapegoats responsible for dampening the team spirit and there’s been much talk on players who are hungry enough to win for the team. In spite of it, the sloppiness lingers. The team spirit remains lackadaisical. Players do the bare minimum with the only consistent player across several seasons being Fernades.",
      "The reason I adore Mourinho’s time with United is based on the simple fact he worked the boys to a Europa trophy. You could see the way some of the players limped towards their medals. He pushed them hard. It reminded of what it meant to play for Ferguson. You either worked your butt off or moved. Other coaches treat them as snowflakes.",
      "Amorim’s recent interview has shown he is not fit for the job. His morale is low. His drive, beaten up. He has not shown any sense of urgency by tweaking his formation. He is like the proverbial mad man doing the same thing over and again while expecting the same results.",
      "This is business, not a charity organization. If he can’t inspire this team, after ostracizing other players in his revamp, he should resign.\nVictor, Nigeria. Glory Glory Man Utd.",
      "",
      "What (the f..k) is wrong with MUFC? Your inbox is overflowing with vitriol, hand wringing and hundreds of different interpretations but I have YET to see one viable solution. We’ve changed owners, infrastructure, coaches, players, playing style and goodness knows what else yet nothing seems to have worked.",
      "Maybe, as someone (somewhat harshly) said, we’ve just reverted back to the mean, i.e. pre Fergie days, the days of Duxbury and Blackmore, or the 70’s team that got relegated, before we developed (or more accurately, marketed!) this rubbish about DNA. The media follows and scrutinizes every nuance (“his facial expressions look like he’s given up”) and former players constantly pound on about how things used to be. They remind me of the MAGA folk with their constant mantra of “Make United Great Again”. Let’s me honest, during the Fergie years, we were blessed, spoilt and damn lucky. A whole bunch of things came together at the same time. The stars were aligned. But WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO EXPECT TO EVER BE THAT GOOD AGAIN. And this is the simple fact that everyone seems to be ignoring.",
      "The current owners suck every penny possible from the club while the players drive up in luxury cars.  I’m sure it’s a toxic place to work at the moment. We’ve had countless managers in the last few years. Does anyone seriously think a new manager is the solution? And as Amorin said, you can’t change all 22 players. “Open Heart Surgery”? This patient has flat lined.",
      "The only solution, as far as I can see, is to stick with Amorin and go down. This will shed the prima donnas and allow us to re-build with young, hungry youth who still think it is a privilege to play for the shirt (which ironically is what Amorin did at Sporting). Last season we were (un)lucky not to go down and just a few months later, Gary Neville thinks we will make the Top Four! Maybe a season or two out of the spotlight is about the only thing that hasn’t been tried. Then we will really see who wants to play for MUFC making JUST 50k a week!\nAdidasmufc (If it forced the Glazers to sell, it might even be worth it)",
      "",
      "So the Man Utd manager merry go round looks like it’s cranking up again right on time. I’d expect the players to come out and give another terrible performance against Burnley just to twist the knife and ensure there is no option but to sack Amorim. 2-0 or 3-1 to Burney I would guess with a goalkeeper howler the icing on the cake – probably an Olympico.",
      "Whether you want him to stay longer or not, like him or not, it is pretty ridiculous to blame the manager. Yet another high profile manager who has failed.",
      "So it must be the players then? According to Transfermkt we have the 5th most expensive squad in the league. And we were 5th last year too yet finished 15th. So it surely cannot be the quality of the players.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the players attitude is terrible and has been for a long time regardless of who is in charge. They do manage to pick themselves up for the big games and occasionally get a commendable draw to fool us into thinking there’s some hope. Attitude is not the players fault. Your attitude is driven by your compensation and working conditions. Clearly Utd players are extremely well compensated so even clearer is that their working conditions must be absolutely atrocious. Yes, it must be terrible to pick up 200 k per week to kick a ball about I hear you say. Grimsby players are happily kicking a ball about with smiles on their faces for significantly less money. So are most of the other teams in the premier league.",
      "So yeah, let’s just get a shiny new manager again, spend a few hundred million on his type of players and listen to the club bulshit us that they have a long term plan and that it will take a few transfer windows to fix. Don’t worry, we’ll win the league in three years time lads, we have a plan… does the 3 years start again with the new manager? Asking for a friend…",
      "The way the club is run, we deserve to be relegated but that still wouldn’t make those in charge stop and think that maybe it’s never been the pl;ayers or the manager, they’re just the easy targets of a club where so many senior club positions have seen well renowned people come and go with such regularity that clearly there is political fuck-tard-ery hapenning that is ruining the club from the inside. We have no right to think we should be title contenders every year but the amount of money the club has compared to the rest does mean that the current state of the club can only be caused by severe incompetenece at board level.\nJon, Cape Town (Get relegated, Glazers out, maybe we might win a few games in the Championship, especially if all our current players defect and we have to bring through our youth.

      "When Rúben Amorim walked into Manchester United, I’ll admit it: I let optimism in through the front door. Not blind optimism, not naïve giddiness, but a conscious decision on how to live life and how to relate to football. Supporting United, after all, isn’t just about results. It’s about how you choose to hold yourself through the cycles of joy and pain.",
      "Lets take a little journey through the season thus far",
      "Arsenal: Pleasure in the Pain",
      "A loss is a loss, and a title race probably died before it was ever born – but the performance brought more pleasure than pain. United played well. Fine margins swung the contest: VAR blessing Arsenal with a questionable goal, a penalty shout ignored, Dorgu’s shot pinging off the post, Raya standing tall in goal. There was enough there to feel alive again, to sense possibility.",
      "Fulham: A Half to Remember Against Fulham,",
      "Disappointment on paper but a bright first half. Cunha already looks like he could be sensational. Amorim nailed it in his analysis: United became too focused on holding onto the result rather than playing. That’s coaching clarity – an honesty I value more than lip service.",
      "Grimsby: oh God Grimsby! Goalkeepers and Perspective",
      "Then came Grimsby. What do you even say? The truth is simple: United need a goalkeeper. Hard to find, harder to bed in, but the difference it makes is night and day.And yet as bad as it was and jeez loueeeze Onana why! — United clawed back to 2-2, showed fight, and were a penalty away from advancing. Embarrassing? Of course. Defining? Not really. Ole reached semis and finals without winning them. Ten Hag delivered two trophies, but that wasn’t enough to make me shed a tear when he left. In fact i cheered. He was an odd man!  Football moves on.",
      "On Amorim",
      "Here’s the crux: I love Amorim. It could be another false dawn. He could be sacked tomorrow if results don’t turn. His post-Grimsby interview carried a chill that United fans know too well. But that doesn’t shake me.  Because how you support your club is personal. For me, it’s not about playing small or coy. I grew up in the glory days. I will die on the hill that football is cyclical, and United will be back. Juventus were relegated, came back, and won multiple titles. Why should Manchester United be any different?So yes, results are awful. Amorim’s future is uncertain. But Manchester United aren’t a pity project. We’re a behemoth, and behemoths rise. Sunnier days will come.",

Russell Martin’s first 9 weeks at the club have been so calamitous, bewildering and humiliating that he has surely now completely destroyed his reputation as a coach. Once he’s finally jettisoned from the Ibrox hot seat he’ll hopefully never darken the door of a dugout ever again.",
      "Without going into detail about our inevitably pathetic start to this season under Martin (because I know that know one is bothered about Scottish football other than Johnny Nic), I wanted to touch on the strangely similar fates of Rangers and Man Utd, two former perennial league challengers who suffered equally if slightly different humiliations on Wednesday night.",
      "Both clubs emerged as the dominant force in their countries in the 90s, both big spenders who could pick and choose who they wanted and hoovered up trophy after trophy, becoming the panto villains of their leagues. Then in the 2000s, both were suddenly pegged back by domestic challenges – in Scotland from a Larsson-inspired O’Neill side and from Wenger/Mourinho respectively in England. The trophies weren’t as easy to come by in this decade though both clubs did manage 3 titles in a row amongst some other great moments.",
      "Then the wheels come off. For Rangers this is 2012, admin, relegation to the Scottish third division and a painful and mind-numbing climb back up to the top flight. For United, 2013 and the retirement of Fergie. Obviously their 2010s weren’t as totally abject but it’s clearly when the rot set in.",
      "Since then both clubs have had little glimmers of hope – the odd trophy, a league title for Rangers, both have reached EL finals – but currently both find themselves with unwanted and disliked ‘system’ managers with neither the players to play these systems, nor the ability to coach them.",
      "Maybe they’re still the clubs which best represent the UK in 2025. Both fallen giants, one with a huge global reach but with supporters who must be wondering why they should still bother to respect their adopted club, the other undone by financial mismanagement and dodgy tax practices. Both currently owned by Americans.",
      "So what lies in store for these two 90s giants? Do we sit tight and await the arrival of some sort of new generational manager to rescue us? Hope that our rivals fail so badly as to allow us to catch up? What does it mean when the classic glory-hunter clubs stop achieving glory?",

      "2. The Bruno dilemma. Amorim didn’t have the guts to move on from Bruno at the pivotal moment when the money could have been reinvested. Instead, the team remains unbalanced around him.",
      "3. Favoritism over competition. He preaches competition but picks his favourites regardless of form. That’s how you lose the dressing room — just ask Ten Hag or Solskjaer.",
      "4. The “donut guy” effect. Amorim is the classic office donut guy: bad at his job but really nice, so people look the other way. He gives media and YouTubers open access, which shields him from proper criticism.",

I’m rather hoping it’s the latter, because I’d be quite keen to see Kobbie Mainoo in black and white. I do think that Manchester United supporters should keep faith in Mbeumo and Sesko, though.

We can definitely agree that it set the tone for the utter dismantling of everything that had been built.",

He completely destabilised the team that was seeming to be coming together. He might have even got something out of Sancho, because there’s a lad that needs an arm round the shoulder not being shouted at. He did choose to sign Maguire though, so he’ll always have that mark against him. But sacking Ole was wrong, for me. The facts of his tenure prove it.",

We replaced “he has no style” with *this*, after all, and mostly because he never got the media onside. But we should have also listen to Rangnick (also more points per game than Amorim).",

Whoever comes next needs to be someone who picks the team up again. We aren’t in a position of expecting success – although inevitably there are many “fans” who think otherwise – but we absolutely have a squad that should be at the upper end of the league.

The arrogance and ignorance of billionaires in full effect.",

      "“For sure, 100 per cent, we are a much better team with Cole, no doubt,” he said. “But when Cole is not in the game, we need to find different solutions. Last week we found different solutions, and hopefully tomorrow we can again find different solutions.”",

      "Spurs will desperately be hoping the Netherlands international can add some sparkle and guile, because the boos will only get louder if Tottenham put in more performances like this.Declan Olley",
      "It would have been interesting to hear the thoughts of new signing Nick Woltemade as he watched Newcastle's goalless draw at Elland Road.",
      "But he was not watching the Magpies at their best. Without the creative sparks of Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak - who may still leave the club by 7pm on Monday - and missing the string-pulling of Joelinton, Newcastle fell a bit flat.",
      "The absences were noticeable. There were just eight shots, two on target and no big chances created. As they did in their opening game against Aston Villa, there was a lack of goals that desperately needs to be filled.",
      "And that could be answered easily after the international break. Woltemade will be in line for a debut, while Gordon and Joelinton's returns will likely not be far behind.",
      "And Isak could still be in those famous white and black stripes, although that situation may take a little more time to resolve. Watch this space.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Before facing Everton in their opening game of the Premier League season, Leeds boss Daniel Farke said the atmosphere at Elland Road would be a huge part of them being able to beat the drop.",
      "And he's being proved right.",
      "In their two home games, Leeds are unbeaten, winning against Everton and now drawing against Newcastle. Admittedly, neither were at their best, but when you are newly promoted and points mean prizes, Leeds will not mind.",
      "Elland Road has long had a reputation for being a difficult place to play when the fans are in full voice. Whatever fate may have befallen their team, Leeds fans have never stopped making their ground a horrible place for opposing teams.",
      "In fact, all three of the promoted clubs are giving their visitors something to think about. None of them have lost at home yet this season.",
      "If Leeds are to beat the drop - and based on the evidence so far, that is a real possibility - then the home form will be key in that. So far, so good.Charlotte Marsh",
      "Inevitably, Marco Silva cut a frustrated figure on the touchline for the vast majority of the game at Stamford Bridge. Pacing up and down the touchline, arguing his team's case to officials and constantly shaking his head.",
      "At half-time, he almost resisted the urge to approach Rob Jones on the pitch and pulled himself back down the tunnel. Across the second half, you could even see him stewing in the dugout, laughing to himself in disbelief following the lengthy VAR delay that went against his side.",
      "However, in his post-match press conference, he gathered himself and, before discussing the grievances he had from the game, he chose to focus on the positives.",
      "Fulham were the better side in the first half; they deserved their lead which got snatched away from them and you could tell they were deflated after the restart.",
      "But he was right to focus on the positives. The transfer window has been difficult to navigate, with just one signing so far, but his side have impressed in the early stages of the season, despite not having the points to show for it.",
      "They battled back against Brighton. They did the same against Manchester United and could have won that fixture quite easily. They should have walked away with something from this game.",
      "When it rains, it pours. Luck is against them at the moment, but they have the quality in this side, as well as the potential new recruits that Silva expects to arrive before Deadline Day, that will turn that in their favour soon enough.Patrick Rowe",
      "Wilson Isidor will understandably steal the headlines for Sunderland with his dramatic late winner. However, while the super-sub will take the spotlight, a glimmer remains on the real star of the show for the Black Cats.",
      "Enzo Le Fee was arguably the most important piece of the puzzle in Regis Le Bris' play-off winners last season, but in order to adjust to Premier League football, an overhaul of the squad has meant the midfielder has played a lesser role to start the season.",
      "Across the win against West Ham and the defeat to Burnley, Le Fee managed a combined 40 minutes of play. Yet, his head coach backed him to start over Simon Adingra and the Frenchman made sure to repay the faith shown in him.",
      "Despite operating off the left-hand side, Le Fee effectively acted as an added midfield player when Sunderland transitioned into their defensive phases. His work rate was hard to top, epitomised in the first half as he sprinted half the length of the pitch to produce an immaculate slide tackle to stop a Brentford break right in its tracks.",
      "His work off the ball was eventually awarded with a goal, showing Kevin Schade how to finish from the penalty spot. But what he produced throughout the contest was a reminder to those with a short-term memory why he quickly became beloved at the Stadium of Light last season.Callum Bishop",
      "Brentford looked a demoralised outfit after Sunderland's last-minute heroics put them to the sword on Wearside. But the biggest turning point came far earlier when Kevin Schade missed a penalty for the Bees early in the second half.",
      "The decision for Schade to take it was a strange one. Igor Thiago - Brentford's big-money striker who scored a penalty against Forest in the Bees' opening fixture - seemed the obvious choice from the spot. But Schade, who has never scored a penalty in his professional career, stepped up instead. He produced a weak effort, inviting Roefs to save and send the Stadium of Light wild.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews had implored before the game that any opportunity to let the lively home fans into the game was to be avoided. But that's exactly what Schade's miss prompted. Brentford cowered in big moments from then on, conceding just three minutes after Thiago netted their eventual opener and losing in stoppage time to a Wilson Isidor winner.",
      "Asked about the penalty dilemma after the game, Andrews said that he had been conscious of the fact the Bees lost their usual penalty taker in Bryan Mbeumo over the summer. Yet, the fact that a former set-piece coach hasn't identified a first choice in the Cameroonian's place makes for a rather surprising admission that could continue to prove costly.Noah Langford",
      "Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri were always going to be big losses alongside Nelson Semedo. At present, the drop off in class is all too evident. Wolves pushed for an equaliser, causing some chaos, but a point would have been scarcely deserved.",
      "Pumping long balls towards the giant Sasa Kalajdzic looked the best bet, but Wolves do not have players of the quality of Grealish or Ndiaye in the final third and it shows. It will be a struggle even with Jorgen Strand Larsen. Without him, hopes could be dashed.",
      "That seems to be the sentiment among supporters who have seen their side extricate themselves from trouble in two of the past three seasons but see a side whose trajectory is very apparent. \"Back the team or sell the club,\" they sang to the owners.",
      "Asked in the press conference about those chants and whether he feels backed, Vitor Pereira said: \"They are trying to help the team. I hope until the end of the market they try to add at least two players to help us because we need more solutions. Especially in attack.\"Adam Bate",

      "Leny Yoro did not feature in Manchester United's disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup; United still searching for their first win of the season after defeat to Arsenal and a draw at Fulham in the Premier League; they host Burnley on Saturday",
      "By Danyal Khan - @danyalhkhan",
      "Saturday 30 August 2025 18:07, UK",
      "Leny Yoro says \"little mistakes\" are costing Manchester United in what has been a difficult week for the team ahead of their Premier League match against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "Optimism after positive signs against Arsenal have been tempered after a disappointing week with a draw at Fulham followed by a disastrous loss to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, with United still searching for their first win of the season.",
      "Yoro, who has been a bright spark of Manchester United's present and future having signed for the club last summer from Lille, did not travel for the tie against Grimsby and admitted it has been challenging week at Old Trafford.",
      "\"This game is in the past now and we need to move forward and think about Burnley. The team is ready to hold their heads up and we're looking forward to the game.\"",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was pretty clear with his comments after his side's defeat at Grimsby, saying \"something needs to change\" and although he later admitted he may have got a little carried away, Yoro acknowledged the team are not helping themselves in games.",
      "\"It's difficult because I think without the Grimsby game - against Fulham and Arsenal I think we were a bit unlucky in these games because we did well, honestly,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to score and we conceded goals we can avoid - I think these are the small things we need to improve.",
      "\"If we don't concede these little mistakes, we will win games - it's just little mistakes we need to change.\"",
      "With the positive energy created over the summer and during pre-season slightly negated, United could find themselves heading towards a potential crisis if they fail to beat Burnley on Saturday.",
      "However, one message that has been clear having spoken to Amorim himself and many of the players is that they feel the team is closer than ever, and that might be just a decisive factor in navigating this tricky start to the season for United.",
      "Yoro said: \"Once we enter Carrington, we focus on ourselves and the spirit of the team.",
      "\"The team spirit is really important for our team and we saw in pre-season when we were always together - we built a spirit.",
      "\"This type of game [Grimsby] helps also to have a good spirit because we need to stay together no matter what the result is.",
      "\"We need to reflect this on the pitch and try to do everything to do it.\"",
      "It is no secret Yoro has a close relationship with former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand.",
      "The former United legend was credited for being a convincing force in bringing Yoro to Old Trafford, who admitted when signing for the club he spent 10 minutes on the phone with Ferdinand which helped make up his mind on picking United as his next club.",
      "But over the last 12 months, Yoro's evident development has received not just praise but also comparisons to Ferdinand in terms of his defensive style and comfort on the ball - a comparison Yoro is not upset about.",
      "Yoro said: \"When you are compared to Rio, I think you can just be happy with this.",
      "\"If I can have the same career he did here, I think it's not bad!",
      "\"I'm really happy with this comparison and I know him personally as a person and as a player - it only benefits me.",
      "\"United are one of the best clubs in the world, it was not too difficult for me to choose and I liked the project, I know we will be good in the future.\"",
      "While Yoro individually is showing clear signs of progression, one goal he will have his sights on is next summer's World Cup. He has been capped at every level for France from U17s to the U23s but he is yet to appear for the senior side.",
      "Although France have had incredible depth in most positions for almost a decade, centre-back could be a position that may be up for grabs come next summer - and that is certainly a target for the 19-year-old.",
      "\"Of course it's a dream to play for the France team, especially play in a World Cup,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"I'll try and do my best this season to achieve this and I know maybe with time it'll be more calm, so I just need to be patient to continue to work and have good performances.\"",

      "Image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo celebrating in February 2024 went viral but 16 months on all three could be heading for the Manchester United exit door; what went wrong for promising young trio and who is to blame for their failure to fire for Ruben Amorim?",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 13:32, UK",
      "Instantly iconic. But now, for the wrong reasons.",
      "The image of Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo, sat on the advertising boards at Old Trafford in celebration in February 2024, appeared to showcase Man Utd's bright future.",
      "A year-and-a-half on, Hojlund and Garnacho look set to leave before the end of this transfer window, Mainoo is out of the first-team frame in the Premier League, while the club lurches into another crisis.",
      "How did it come to this? And who is to blame?",
      "Hojlund, then aged 21, had opened the scoring against West Ham. Alejandro Garnacho, just 19, struck two more. Kobbie Mainoo, the 18-year-old academy starlet, would go on to start a Euros final for England a few months later.",
      "Their combined celebration for Garnacho's first goal was a cheeky dig back at West Ham's Mohammed Kudus, who had marked his goal in the reverse fixture a couple of months earlier in similar fashion.",
      "But it came to stand for more than that. This was a snapshot of hope, an image to believe better times were ahead.",
      "Hojlund was in the hot streak of his Man Utd career, in the midst of a run which saw him bag seven goals in six games.",
      "Garnacho recorded his best figures for goal involvements that season, scoring seven in the Premier League - including that Puskás winner at Everton - and the opener in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Mainoo also netted at Wembley, seemingly confirming his rise would inevitably take him to the top.",
      "Sitting down with then-United boss Erik ten Hag in the days after the Old Trafford photo was taken, the Dutchman sounded a warning to the trio.",
      "But unquestionably the feeling at that point was optimism. \"We have some exciting players,\" said Ten Hag, when he was asked about the celebration. There was a smile from a manager who is typically more interested in tactical talk than emotions.",
      "He could see the importance of the symbolism and also what it meant to Man Utd supporters.",
      "After all, this is a club which prides itself on its history of developing and honing young talents.",
      "Yet, fast forward to the final days of this summer's transfer window and Hojlund is off to Napoli, Garnacho to Chelsea and Mainoo - that prized, homegrown asset - can't get in the first team, has requested a loan and is expected to be the subject of offers from elsewhere.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho, in particular, feel victims of circumstance - and Ruben Amorim's fixation on 3-4-3.",
      "The Englishman isn't trusted in the central midfield two - despite playing a similar role alongside Declan Rice at the Euros. Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte are favoured there.",
      "He got a runout in the disastrous defeat to Grimsby but it is clear Amorim isn't convinced he has the attributes for the position.",
      "A short-lived experiment to play Mainoo off the striker seems over too, with United spending big on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. With Fernandes also deployed in that more advanced role, Mainoo, again, could count him fourth-choice in another position.",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, finds himself a winger for a team which no longer uses them - and a wing-back role never looked like a conversion to maximise his talents.",
      "There have been strops at substitutions and friction off the field but attitude is not a core reason for his exit.",
      "For Hojlund, too many misses have ultimately been his undoing, with Benjamin Sesko now signed to lead the line. However, he could justifiably point to a far from fully-functioning attack around him.",
      "And there should also be sympathy for a young forward who was never intended to carry the weight of being United's lead striker, having arrived in a summer when they intended to also go for Harry Kane.",
      "Interestingly, Hojlund had more goals than Kane when he turned 22 but United want to move on.",
      "It is not hard to imagine this trio following Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay and Antony in rejuvenating their careers away from Old Trafford.",
      "They are all talented and will surely enjoy good times again. And that will raise more questions about the environment and culture at United - and perhaps, down the line, regrets.",
      "Where, for instance, will Mainoo be in a couple of years time, when Fernandes, Casemiro and Ugarte will likely have departed?",
      "Would Amorim's successor - whether he arrives sooner or later - not wish to have a winger with Garnacho's threat?",
      "The pair could be jettisoned in favour of the ideas of a head coach with the worst Man Utd managerial record in the modern era.",
      "It has been the story of United since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement: veering from one direction to another with little thought of the long-term plan.",
      "Hojlund, Garnacho and Mainoo looked set to be the future when they were pictured together on that promising day at Old Trafford. Just 16 months on they are out of the frame.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho was one of five Manchester United players to be left out of first-team action during pre-season; Chelsea have already spent over £250m this summer, with fellow attackers Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, Estevao and Jamie Gittens joining Enzo Maresca's squad",
      "Friday 29 August 2025 11:57, UK",
      "Chelsea have agreed a £40m fee with Manchester United to sign Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The forward was undergoing a medical on Friday.",
      "The deal, which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee, represents the fourth-largest sale in United's history after those of Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria - and the club's largest ever sale of an academy graduate.",
      "A compromise over Garnacho's valuation had to be reached as United valued him at £50m - which was more than Chelsea were prepared to pay.",
      "United negotiated the fee up from an initial Chelsea offer of £25m and are understood to feel it is a good, pragmatic deal, delivering their largest sale fee for five years. They also believe it is a good solution for the player, who has been pushing strongly to leave.",
      "It is understood he leaves with United's best wishes.",
      "Garnacho turned down offers from other clubs because he wanted to move to Chelsea. The winger was told he could leave at the end of last season and he is not training with Ruben Amorim's first-team squad.",
      "\"We've reported in the past that Chelsea were considering opening bids of £25m.",
      "\"I know some Manchester United supporters were very angry with those reports.",
      "\"It's all been sorted out now. It's a £40m fixed fee and United will also retain a 10 per cent sell-on clause for the player.",
      "\"This is a significant deal for United. They are often criticised for not getting enough for players and not making money from selling players.",
      "\"This is the largest ever sale for a Manchester United academy product.",
      "\"From United's perspective, they are very, very happy because a £40m fixed fee is a very good deal for them, for a player who didn't really have a future at the club.\"",
      "Speaking earlier this summer, United boss Amorim said: \"You can understand and you can see he's a really talented boy, and sometimes things don't work out.",
      "\"You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling, I think it's clear that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership, and I can understand that. So I think it's not a problem.",
      "\"Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge, so we try to make everything OK to all the parts. To the club, to the coach and to the players. It's a natural thing in football.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
