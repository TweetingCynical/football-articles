      "Rio Ferdinand has praised both Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw for the way they reacted to criticism from Roy Keane. Following a 3-0 defeat to Manchester City, former United captain Keane pulled no punches when assessing Shaw's performance.",
      "He claimed the England centre-back had 'given up' during the contest, which led to a goal, and that he had 'got away with murder' for years at United. Such criticism from Keane after a loss is nothing new, but Shaw chose to address the comments following the victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford a week later.",
      "The left-back explained that he agreed with the former captain's feedback and that he 'did not need Keane to tell him' when his performances were not up to scratch. Maguire made his 250th appearance for United against City, and after being celebrated prior to the Chelsea win, the defender insisted that Shaw is an 'excellent player' as he launched a stern defence of his teammate.",
      "And speaking exclusively to MEN Sport ahead of fronting Talking Future's new initiative Half Time Talks, Ferdinand heaped praise on the pair for how they responded to Keane's comments.",
      "He said: \"Personally I think it is great from Harry Maguire because that is the job of a captain/senior player to come in and defend your players if you think that they are being unfairly treated. I also think Luke Shaw coming out and speaking himself is what I like.",
      "\"I like to see players come out and go: ‘You know what, I am not having that or actually, they are right. I was under par for the level that I have set myself.’",
      "\"I am sure he will put in a performance this week Luke Shaw that will make you think: ‘He is made of the right stuff.’ I just think that Luke Shaw is a magnificently talented player, he has just been so unfortunate with injuries that he has never been able to maintain his fitness and it goes back to that word again, consistency.",
      "\"If you can’t be consistent with appearances and being available, it is going to be difficult for you to really stamp your authority and really sustain the level of performances that is required for a top club.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Brentford and Manchester United star Sergio Reguilon is without a club at just 28 years old. Reguillon joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2020 but after starring for Spurs for two seasons he was then loaned out to Atletico Madrid, United and the Bees.",
      "Despite an initial bright start in north London, Reguilon lost his place under former manager Ange Postecoglou. He now remains a free agent after his release from Spurs in July, following the expiration of his contract, and making just six appearances in his final year at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Looking to reignite his career, the Spanish star only made 12 appearances for the Red Devils after joining on transfer deadline day in 2023. His arrival at Old Trafford materialised only after United failed to sign primary target Marc Cucurella, who joined Chelsea.",
      "The Spaniard had an inconsistent time working under ex-United boss Erik ten Hag. He came in and out of the team before United ended his time with the club prematurely in the January transfer window of 2024.",
      "His time at United was such a contentious signing with some that former Red Devil Roy Keane once became embroiled in an argument with ex-Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp, after the latter had claimed that Reguilon was a good left-back.",
      "Keane, referring to the player's one season stint at Real Madrid in 2018/2019, then said: \"Is that why Real Madrid let him go? Why did Real Madrid let him go?\" Redknapp then doubled down on his take as he replied: \"Does that matter? Just because Real Madrid let him go doesn't make him a good player? He's a fantastic left-back.\"",
      "Despite his brief spell at Old Trafford, Reguilon harbours no ill feelings towards United. \"It has been great to play for Manchester United and I just want to say thank you to the club, the fans and my teammates,\" he said upon leaving, adding: \"It was a privilege to play for this huge club. I wish all the best for the Red Devils.\"",
      "After departing United, Reguilon then joined Brentford in January 2024, where he made 16 appearances before leaving in the summer and returning to Spurs for the final year of his deal. Upon arriving at Brentford, Reguilon praised their former boss Thomas Frank, who is now in charge at Tottenham.",
      "He said: “I'm very happy, I think this is what I need now in this moment in my career. I want to meet my team-mates and play with them, and now just enjoy my football on the pitch.",
      "“Thomas was key in this move, for me. I'm in a moment where I need to play consistently and I think this club can give me that. These six months, I will do everything for the team, but it’s also important for my future. I'm happy after my conversation with Thomas; he knows me very well.",
      "“We had many conversations about everything. I remember the first time was more than 40 minutes talking about football, about everything.\"",
      "Reguilon is now on the hunt for a new club and had been linked with Everton. However, the Spaniard is more likely to return to his home country, with Seville and Real Sociedad thought to be interested.",
      "Two of Reguilon's former clubs will meet on Saturday lunchtime when the Bees host Ruben Amorim's United at the Gtech Community Stadium in the Premier League.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber has thrown his support behind Benjamin Sesko after the Slovenian's sluggish beginning at Old Trafford. The 22-year-old joined United from RB Leipzig during the summer transfer window in a deal potentially worth £73.7million.",
      "The Red Devils pipped Champions League outfit Newcastle United to Sesko's signature, whilst Arsenal had also shown interest in the forward before choosing to snap up Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead. Sesko has struggled to find his feet at M16, failing to find the net in six outings for Ruben Amorim's side thus far.",
      "The Slovenia international was also hauled off at the interval against Chelsea last weekend following Casemiro's dismissal just before half-time. And Webber, who understands the pressures of playing up front for United having made three appearances for the club between 2000 and 2003, has defended the young striker.",
      "\"I feel it's sometimes unfair for Sesko, and I felt the same with [Rasmus] Hojlund. When you're asking somebody at that age to come in and be the starter for Man United and lead the line - it's an unfair expectation. The price tags would suggest differently because that's the market, and as a striker, it's such a specialist position that you need to know how to play it.",
      "\"If you look across the board, the strikers in the Premier League who have done well, you take Harry Kane for example, when he was in the Premier League, he did his legwork, he went to places where he didn't score so many goals, but everywhere you go, you're building and you're adding to your arsenal.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins, who has been a consistent performer now in the Premier League, did his legwork. You look at [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, who came in; they've gone and done their legwork prior, so none of them came in at 21, 22, and were just scoring 20 to 30 goals consistently every year.",
      "\"So I feel that it's a tough school for him to come in and just hit the ground running. That said, I do think he's got the ability to do so. It's got to come from him as well, and working at your game every day, analysing your video, having presence on the pitch, speaking to your team-mates, and telling them what you demand from them as a striker.",
      "\"He's had a slow start. Trying to acclimatise very quickly to the Premier League, and it doesn't help when you've not had a consistent preseason either. But I do think that he's got all the tools to be a very good striker for Manchester United. I do feel that he needs a bit of time.\"",
      "Regarding United's campaign overall, Webber insists nobody should get ahead of themselves but acknowledges Amorim's squad must piece together a sequence of victories to establish some desperately needed belief.",
      "\"I think what you'll find in the Premier League this year is everybody will beat everybody. I know Liverpool are out on their own at this moment.",
      "\"In terms of United, you just have to literally, and it's very clichéd, focus on the next game and just try and improve and get things better and build a bit of momentum. It's been a while since the club's been on a run where they've won a lot of games consistently and feel that feeling of confidence going into every single game.",
      "\"I think that's gotta be the first step, looking at making sure we can win consecutive matches and put a smile back on everybody's face.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Jeremy has covered football, rugby and cricket World Cups, as well as Wimbledon, the golf majors and the Olympics.",
      "Up to now, the life of Bryan (Mbeumo) has felt anything but biblical. Surreal, yes, which would be in keeping with the 1979 film made famous by Monty Python .",
      "But just like leading character Brian Cohen, Mbeumo has been mistaken for being some sort of Messiah, where Manchester United are concerned. Mbeumo went from being a big fish in a small pond, to someone with everything to prove when he left Brentford to join United this summer - a move which left lingering resentment between the two top-flight outfits.",
      "He also swapped one of the best run football clubs in the Premier League, for one of the most dysfunctional. United's problems have been desperate and dark in recent times. Which means Mbeumo could be forgiven for feeling a bit more comfortable when he returns to more familiar surroundings on Saturday.",
      "Mbeumo deserves a warm welcome when United take on Brentford. He scored 20 goals in what proved to be his swansong, and helped leave Brentford in a much stronger position than when he joined them in 2019. And he might have felt ready for that next step.",
      "But nothing can prepare someone like Mbeumo for what awaits them at one of the biggest clubs on the planet. But also one that is now one of biggest underachievers as well.",
      "The pressure and demands placed on those who choose to make Old Trafford their new home are on a par with Real Madrid at times.",
      "United supporters demanded success, because Sir Alex Ferguson did what he did to embed it in the club's DNA. And the shirt has worn heavy on the shoulders of United players since the club last won the Premier League title in 2013.",
      "Mbeumo chose to be part of this, having rejected offers from other clubs to force through a move to United.",
      "You have to be built of stubborn and strong stuff to make it in the red half of Manchester. And Mbeumo has made a bright start, winning the 'player of the month' award for August.",
      "He has scored twice in six appearances, but one of these counts for nothing, because it came in United's humiliating and humbling Carabao Cup defeat to minnows Grimsby Town. The inquest which followed was long and loud.",
      "And it will have opened Mbeumo's eyes to how much noise surrounds his new club on a constant basis. The scrutiny is relentless - and can reduce some players to rubble.",
      "And with Mbeumo hailed as one of those signings who can help lead Ruben Amorim's team back to where United have an entitled belief they should be, that pressure is now immense.",
      "And this weekend, along with many more in the future, will show us whether Mbeumo will stand or fall.",

Amorim, the man at the helm at Old Trafford, has faced a barrage of criticism this season following a series of mixed results.",
      "The only Premier League losses so far have been against Arsenal and Manchester City. However, the lacklustre draw against Fulham and the less-than-convincing win over Burnley have left fans feeling underwhelmed.",
      "Last weekend's 2-1 triumph over Chelsea at Old Trafford eased some of the pressure on Amorim, but any slip-ups against struggling Brentford will undoubtedly reignite questions about the Portuguese head coach's suitability for the role. In an exclusive chat with The Mirror as part of the Talking Futures – Half Time Talks initiative, Ferdinand expressed his cautious satisfaction with United's performance so far.",
      "\"I think I am more satisfied than anything,\" he revealed. \"I am not jumping and punching the air, going crazy because we still lack that consistency.",
      "\"But I think the run of games that we have had, I think there is nobody in the league who has had a harder start to the season in terms of opponents. But, to get seven points like that was rather remarkable really and I think that's a positive to take out of it.",
      "\"At the same time, as a football club, you only really get taken seriously when you show a level of consistency with results and I think that is something which is a definite ask and demand of these players.\"",

      "On Saturday, he faces the Bees for the first time, albeit without Frank in the Bees dugout. He has made a good start to life at Old Trafford, finding the net two times and quickly becoming a key member of Amorim's squad.",
      "The Cameroon international admits playing under a different manager has been a challenge, but one he is relishing. Asked about how his new boss compares to his last, Mbeumo said: “Really good. I've found some similarities between them.",
      "“He always tries to do training in a fun way and I think this is really important – to get some fun at football – because it makes life more enjoyable.",
      "“A new manager is a challenge for me. The training sessions are intense. He wants us to do a lot, do big efforts, and that can only help us to be ready on the pitch. I like it.",
      "“I think it's important to improve and get better each day I'm here, and that's what I always do. With time, the team can be better and we're going to work really hard for that. We know we're in a difficult moment, but we just need to stick together.",
      "“They [team-mates] have welcomed me straight away. They're a big part of it. Changing city or club always needs a bot of time, but everyone helped me a lot.",
      "“When I first arrive somewhere, I don't like to be loud or show myself a lot, but I can go with people well and now that's what I've done. It's been great. It's a big club – everything about it – and I'm really happy.",
      "“The team-mates and staff and everyone at Carrington are lovely people, so you really want to come and work here every day. So it's really good.”",
      "Mbeumo joined Brentford from French club Troyes in 2019 and admitted it took him to time to adjust to the change of culture as well as the differences on the pitch in terms of playing style.",
      "“The culture is obviously different, so it was a big change, and the food as well!” said Mbeumo. “It's so different. The language as well, even though I could speak a little bit of English before.",
      "“But especially the food. The porridge was different. I'd never had it before I came here Do I have it every morning now? No!",
      "“I would say Ligue Two is more tactical that the Championship. But the Championship is more physical and with intensity. And the same with England in general. In the Premier League, there are more intense games than in the French league.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are gearing up for a second win on the trot as they head to Brentford this Saturday. Ruben Amorim's team have a golden opportunity to build momentum ahead of a hectic schedule and add to the woes of Keith Andrews' squad.",
      "United managed to edge past Chelsea thanks to first-half goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, despite Trevoh Chalobah's late strike causing a few jitters. However, after finding the back of the net, Casemiro saw red for a second yellow card offence, ruling him out of this weekend's early kick-off in London.",
      "Despite a mixed bag start to the season, United find themselves in 11th place, just three points shy of the Champions League spots. With only two games remaining before the October international break, the Reds will be back in action with a trip to Liverpool on 19 October.",
      "Even though there's over three months until the January transfer window swings open again, rumours continue to swirl around United. We have therefore delved into the latest chatter.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has dismissed reports suggesting that Liverpool could swoop in and steal United's targets Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton.",
      "In recent weeks, rumours have been swirling that Liverpool are on the hunt for a new midfield signing, with two Premier League stars in particular catching their eye. However, a reporter has poured cold water on the idea that either player will be heading to Anfield.",
      "\"At the moment, I'm not really aware of Liverpool pushing for a deeper lying midfielder - if anything, if Liverpool were to add it might've been more of an attacking midfielder,\" he revealed to The United Stand. \"With the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, we know they're going to be in demand, my understanding with Wharton is that there is a gentleman's agreement in place allowing him to leave Crystal Palace next summer so that's obviously one to watch.",
      "\"I think Wharton could leave Palace next summer and with Carlos Baleba, there's going to be two aspects, one is naturally the market pushing towards trying to sign him with multiple suitors - Manchester United fans shouldn't be surprised by that.",
      "\"One of the reasons they did all the leg work during the final weeks of the window was to put them in the strongest position because I do think they'll be moving for Carlos Baleba. You don't commit to what would've been £100million plus spend and walk away because there will be a point in 12 months when that player is for sale.",
      "\"The second aspect is price, even though, many may feel that £100m is a lot of money and may get the deal done, my data and approach suggest this is a player that may command a Moises Caicedo-type fee, £100m or more, in 12 months time. That projection of value priced Baleba out of the market and stopped anyone bidding because Brighton felt that no one is going to match the valuation from a year's time and therefore, the player is not for sale.\"",
      "He added: \"If Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, they don't have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they need to worry about finding £100m plus or even closer to £115m to £120m, hoping Brighton want to sell.",
      "\"Will they be head-to-head with Liverpool? We'll have to wait and see, I think Liverpool will be more inclined to go for a Morgan Rogers-type player, if it isn't Liverpool, there will be other suitors and Brighton will think there's more suitors and his price will go up but also his form, adds to the valuation as well. Man United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in.",
      "\"Could it be Baleba and Wharton or two other midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, Casemiro could leave, Bruno Fernandes could go to Saudi Arabia and third of all because there is a question mark over the future of Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "United's midfield is in dire need of a revamp, and it seems as though Amorim missed the chance to strengthen his options during this summer's spending spree. However, the opportunity to bolster the forward-line was too tempting after last season's goal-scoring issues.",
      "The January transfer window, or more likely, the summer one, present two vital opportunities for the club to bring in quality players that will enable them to compete with the best in England and Europe.",
      "Tutto Juve reports that Juventus defender Gleison Bremer is on the radar of both United and Liverpool, but the Italian club have no plans to let him go.",
      "The Brazilian centre-back is considered an essential part of the squad in Turin as the Italian heavyweights aim to reclaim their spot at the top of Serie A.",
      "The report suggests that Liverpool are eyeing the defender as a potential addition to boost their defensive prowess, given the uncertainty surrounding their pursuit of Marc Guehi. United are also mentioned in the article as rivals to Liverpool.",

      "Barcelona forward Marcus Rashford had a heartwarming reunion with his former Manchester United teammate Eric Bailly on Thursday night, following another impressive performance for the Catalan giants. Rashford notched up his third assist in as many La Liga games, helping Barca to a 3-1 victory over Real Oviedo that maintained their unbeaten start to the season.",
      "Rashford helped Barcelona secure another three points and also had an opportunity to reconnect with an old teammate. Bailly has been playing for Real Oviedo since the summer, after a rocky spell following his departure from United in 2023.",
      "His contract with Besiktas was abruptly terminated due to what the club cited as 'poor performances and incompatibility with the team.' Rafaela Pimenta, Bailly's agent, expressed 'shock' at the decision, arguing that it was unfair given the centre-back's injury woes during his brief stint in Turkey.",
      "However, the Ivorian made the move to Spain, playing for Villarreal for a year and a half before signing with his current club last summer. After Barcelona's triumph, a beaming Rashford shared a quick chat and swapped shirts with Bailly, before joining his new teammates in their celebrations.",
      "The pair enjoyed a close bond during their time at Old Trafford, featuring together in 87 matches for the Red Devils. In 2022, Bailly revealed a private message from the winger which declared how much he missed him while the Ivorian was out on loan at Marseille.",
      "The defender replied: \"This message can make my day. Miss you too Rashy.\"",
      "The pair are set to be reunited again come January when the two sides meet again in the return La Liga fixture. Rashford has so far managed to grab two goals and three assists since joining Barcelona on loan in the summer.",
      "But it hasn't all been plain sailing for the England international. He was dropped from Barcelona's starting line-up last week after turning up late to a team meeting ahead of the fixture.",
      "Rashford was demoted to the bench for Sunday's game against Getafe - but that didn't stop him having an impact as he set up Dani Olmo's goal in the 3-0 win. Barcelona manager Hansi Flick said: \"For Rashford, it's normal not to play. Matches are every three or four days. We have to manage his minutes.",
      "\"You saw that with Fermin [Lopez]. He played many minutes, and we have to take that into account. We got three points, 3-0. Everything is great. We must focus on our game.\"",

      "In recent years, whenever Liverpool have been squaring up against their arch-rivals Manchester United, there's one certainty you could almost always tick off your bingo card.",
      "The sight of legendary Red Devils gaffer Sir Alex Ferguson witnessing the latest defeat at the hands of a team he battled so fiercely to knock off their perch has become a favourite - and frequent - spectacle for telly broadcasters. Sure enough, whenever the Reds are getting one over on United, the cameras swiftly pan to a glum-looking Ferguson in the crowd.",
      "Of course, he's not the only one. With United's struggles ongoing, more than 12 years after Ferguson's retirement and their most recent Premier League title, Red Devils co-owner and Ineos boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe is also often an easy target for the cameras when enduring his club's latest misfortune on the pitch.",
      "But that's not just limited to Old Trafford, with Ratcliffe and INEOS owning multiple clubs across Europe. As a result, the 72-year-old found himself cursing one Liverpool star this week despite the fact that the Reds weren't even playing.",
      "Kostas Tsimikas joined AS Roma on loan from the Reds last month and was handed his first start for the club against OGC Nice - one of Ratcliffe and INEOS' other clubs - in the Europa League this week.",
      "The Greek star wasted no time in leaving his mark as he provided an assist against the Ligue 1 side, delivering a brilliant cross from the left flank for Gianluca Mancini to fire home what proved to be the decisive goal.",
      "The centre-half netted Roma's second strike in the space of just three minutes to double their advantage. Despite Terem Moffi's late penalty consolation, the Serie A side clung on for a 2-1 triumph to get their Europa League campaign off to a winning start.",
      "After Tsimikas' delivery led to Mancini's opener, television cameras quickly cut to a clearly frustrated Ratcliffe watching from the stands as the United co-owner saw his second-biggest investment suffer a setback.",
      "Ratcliffe's INEOS group assumed control at Nice in August 2019, but have experienced patchy results in France. Their best league position under his ownership stands at fourth in Ligue 1, whilst their most impressive European showing came with a Conference League quarter-final appearance in 2023/24.",
      "Ratcliffe has faced criticism for his sporadic attendance at Nice fixtures previously, though he was clearly present at the Allianz Riviera on Wednesday evening, having also sparked debate by confessing his lack of enthusiasm for French football earlier this year.",
      "\"I don't particularly enjoy going to watch Nice because there are some good players, but the level of football is not high enough for me to get excited,\" he revealed to The Times back in March.",
      "Meanwhile, Tsimikas took to Instagram after the match to share a snap of himself celebrating Mancini's goal, complete with yellow and red emojis in a nod to Roma's home colours. Liverpool fans have recently spotted that he's updated his bio on the social media platform to 'Scouser in Rome', showing his ongoing love for his parent club.",
      "Despite being on loan at the Serie A team following Liverpool's acquisition of Milos Kerkez, Roma do not have an option to buy him outright at the end of the season.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes was on hand to offer praise and advice to one of the club's young talents after an impressive showing in training. It comes amid news that Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim has made plans to trim his squad further by placing three players on the transfer list.",
      "Fernandes impressed with his display in last weekend's 2-1 win over Chelsea, with the skipper marking two big milestones over the course of the match, scoring his 100th United goal in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "His performance came after a difficult few weeks for the Portugal international, who has struggled to find his best form after being moved into a deeper role by Amorim this season. However, Fernandes is still highly regarded as a leader by those at the club and beyond, and he showed his class in training this week with an interaction with academy product Sam Mather.",
      "It comes as three of Fernandes' team-mates were identified as likely departures in 2026, with Amorim prepared to let the trio go as he cuts down the bloated squad he inherited from previous United head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "After his impressive display against Chelsea, Fernandes looked full of energy in training again this week, with an official report on the United website saying the Portuguese star displayed \"an astonishing amount of precision, and sometimes cheek, when rifling opportunities into the net on a regular basis\".",
      "However, one moment in training saw the midfielder celebrate the talents of another player, with Mather impressing the first team skipper with a fine effort during a shooting drill.",
      "According to the same report, the 21-year-old \"connected sweetly\" with the ball to \"thunder one shot low into the bottom corner of the net\" during training at Carrington.",
      "The goal was enough to see the academy product earn \"personal praise\" from Fernandes, with the former Sporting CP star impressed with what he was watching.",
      "Salford-born Mather, who plays on the wing, has featured in United's Premier League 2 side, but was keen on a move away from the club over the summer, with his heart set on playing senior football. He was reportedly in talks with Turkish side Kayserispor over a deadline day move, but that failed to materialise.",
      "United boss Amorim is also set to show three senior players the exit door in 2026, and the trio will walk away for nothing.",
      "After selling the likes of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony on permanent deals over the summer and letting others, including Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana, leave on loan, more big names are set to depart to free up funds to help improve the Red Devils' midfield.",
      "With club bosses keen to slash the wage bill, Casemiro is set to lead the departure list when he becomes a free agent at the end of the season. Having been signed for £70 million from Real Madrid in 2022, he has been a regular under both Ten Hag and Amorim but now looks set to leave on a free.",
      "Jadon Sancho is another who will become a free agent next July, having moved to Aston Villa on loan for the 2025/26 campaign. Signed for £73 million three years ago, he is also set to walk away for nothing with United unlikely to trigger the option to extend his contract by a further year.",
      "Also seemingly heading for the exit door is left-back Tyrell Malacia, who has endured a torrid time with injuries since moving to Old Trafford for £13m in 2022. After a summer move to Turkey fell through, he looks set to leave on a free as well.",

He was alongside an Old Trafford regular in Ferguson with the pair having gone up against each other numerous times in their careers.",
      "Both men were managing back in the 1990s and have seen the game develop into what it is today.",
      "Much was made of the dialogue between the two individuals and Allardyce claims the majority of their chat centred around the game as well as what changes they would make.",
      "He said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast: “We talk about why we think United have dropped off, talk about how they need to push up.",
      "\"There are things we chat about in general about what’s happening in the game, and say what we think. Do we think they’ll get a sub on?\"",
      "United's win came with both teams down to ten men after Robert Sanchez and Casemiro were both sent off in the first half.",
      "The Brazilian dismissed for two yellow card offences, which led to a tense finish for the hosts, and Allardyce admits he'd have hauled off the veteran midfielder.",
      "He said: “I would’ve taken Casemiro off after his yellow. Have you seen how many times he’s been sent off? A man of his experience and his age who can’t control himself, he’s just an old player. He’s not an experienced player.",
      "“He’s been doing the same things for all his career that he should’ve cut out years ago, and particularly now he’s not as quick as he used to be, he should be using his experience to make sure that doesn’t happen, but he’s not. He’s doing the same old things he’s always done, diving in, jumping in.\"",
      "Despite Ferguson and Allardyce often going up against each other the Scot did have admiration for the one-game England manager, who remains a friend.",
      "Back in 2010 he was hugely critical of Blackburn's decision to axe him when they were lying 13th in the top flight.",

      "The club would have preferred to see Sancho leave permanently, but, despite interest from Italy, they could not find a deal that suited both club and player. Sancho is in the final year of his contract at Old Trafford, but United can extend his deal by another year.",
      "According to National World, Villa are trying to take advantage of that situation. Emery is pleased with what he has seen so far from Sancho.",
      "The Midlands side also secured a free transfer from United this summer. Victor Lindelof arrived at Villa Park after his contract expired.",
      "Since Sancho arrived at Villa, Emery has set ambitious targets for the winger. The Spanish boss believes a recall to the England squad under Thomas Tuchel could be on the cards - the forward has managed just one appearance since his United switch in 2021.",
      "\"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best, Emery said earlier this month. \"And if he does that, then he'll come back to the national team.",
      "\"Every player wants to be part of the national team. When he was at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic.",
      "\"And he played with the national team 25 matches, more or less. Of course, he's still young.",
      "\"He's still hungry to show his capacity to play with his skills, his qualities. Hopefully, we can exploit here, again, his best.\"",

      "Dabo is on the books at the Be Sport Academy who have had previous ties to Barcelona. While the midfielder is on the radar of the Spanish club, it is thought that United are on the verge of completing the deal.",
      "United have widened their academy recruitment in recent years, which is partly motivated by Brexit rules which prevent them from signing players from other clubs in Europe. Back in January they agreed a £3.3m fee, rising to a potential £7m with add-ons, with Cerro Porteno to sign Diego Leon.",
      "The deal saw Leon would complete his move from Paraguay in the summer window. Leon impressed coaches at Carrington and exclusively worked with the first team in pre-season and has talked up his hopes of appearing for the club this term.",

The disciplinary action from Hansi Flick came just days after Rashford netted his maiden goals for the Spanish giants, though the Barcelona boss insisted he was simply rotating his squad.",

      "\"You're a bully, and you get accused of bullying and stuff.\"",
      "Rooney then shared his thoughts on the changing culture within football dressing rooms. \"What happened to speaking the truth and saying, like, 'What are you doing?' Having a go, because when you used to have a go at me, [I'm thinking] 'I'm not letting him do that again'. Or I'd have a go at you,\" he said.",

      "Jadon Sancho was quick to heap praise on former Manchester United team-mate Antony after the Brazilian netted a late equaliser for Real Betis in their Europa League clash with Nottingham Forest. Antony made a triumphant return to Betis following a successful loan stint there last season, sealing a permanent move in the closing stages of the summer transfer window.",
      "Since his full-time switch to Spain, the Brazilian has featured in both league matches and bagged his first goal against Ange Postecoglou's side on Wednesday night. In the 15th minute, Antony demonstrated his creative prowess by setting up Cedric Bakambu's opening goal.",
      "Despite Igor Jesus putting Forest ahead with two goals within five minutes, Antony emerged as the hero of the night for Manuel Pellegrini's squad. He scored a well-executed equaliser in the 85th minute.",
      "Sancho, who also left the United 'bomb squad' over the summer, was among those excluded from Ruben Amorim's team and had to train separately from the main squad alongside Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. The winger joined fellow Premier League side Aston Villa on loan until the end of the season.",
      "On social media, Sancho captured Antony's late equaliser against Forest and posted: \"Hermano! *fire emoji* *clapping hands emoji\". 'Hermano' is Spanish for brother.",
      "Antony has since replied to the message. Reposting Sancho's response, he added in a caption reading \"High foot\", along with eyes, and laughing and red heart emoji, he also tagged both Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Antony's European exploits for Betis follow his instrumental role in guiding them to the Conference League final last season. He netted four times and provided three assists before falling at the final hurdle to Sancho's Chelsea.",
      "Betis made a concerted effort to sign Antony during the summer transfer window, with the deal appearing to be off at one stage. A potential move to Saudi Arabia was rumoured, but it was consistently reported that Betis was his preferred choice.",
      "His start with the Spanish side since completing a permanent move has been slow with no goal contributions in his first two La Liga games. Antony will hope that the equaliser against Forest will now kickstart his season.",
      "Real Betis are back in action on Sunday when they take on Osasuna in La Liga (8pm kick-off).",

It was a big, a needed result but I think, as well as being very grateful for the three points, I think he'll think about his players, 'when I was under the cosh, you actually came out fighting.'",

      "Kobbie Mainoo is determined to win his starting role back at Manchester United this season.",

      "Mainoo is desperate to start regularly for United again after slipping down the pecking order.",
      "The 20-year-old wanted to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, but United did not entertain his request. The MEN have been told Mainoo did not want to leave his boyhood club permanently, and only wanted a loan for the sake of regular minutes in an important season.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, September 26.",
      "We have a busy day coming up for United fans with Ruben Amorim set to address the media this afternoon ahead of Saturday's early kick-off against Brentford in the Premier League. The Reds will be hopeful that they can keep their momentum going after defeating Chelsea last weekend.",
      "While the focus is clearly on the pitch, talks over transfers has remained with Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba as two of their midfield targets. Players contracted to United are also at the centre of major updates with a Kobbie Mainoo decision speaking volumes.",
      "There has also been plenty of verdicts delivered on Marcus Rashford with most of those fairly negative, but Barcelona's stance is clear",
      "Stay tuned for all of the latest live updates throughout the day...",
      "Manchester United will be without several members of their squad for the clash against Brentford.",
      "Amad, who will not feature after being granted compassionate leave after suffering a family bereavement.",
      "\"Amad is not here, someone in his family passed away and we are giving all the support to him,\" he said.",
      "\"For Amad, we are here for him, it's a tough moment. In these kind of moments it's not the most important thing [football]. We can win without Amad, but also we want to win for Amad.\"",
      "Noussair Mazraoui and Lisandro Martinez are both sidelined through injury. Casemiro will serve a one-game suspension for the red card he picked up in the win over Chelsea.",
      "Former Denmark international Mikkel Beckmann believes a move away from Manchester United may be an option for highly-rated forward Chido Obi.",
      "He told Viaplay: \"The reserve team matches… it doesn’t taste particularly good. It’s like when we have our Future Cup matches at home. It’s the reserves who play, and it’s just far from the same as playing first-team football,” he said.",
      "\"I just don’t think the time is right for Amorim to suddenly try Chido Obi out at United.",
      "“He is very, very far from the first team at United. I would like to see him play some senior football at a higher level than just reserves at United.”",
      "Chido Obi was in and around the first-team pictures last season under Ruben Amorim but has largely remained with the under-21s this season after an influx of attackers.",
      "Marcus Rashford grabbed another goal contribution for Barcelona in the 3-1 La Liga win over Real Oviedo on Thursday evening.",
      "The England international was back in the starting XI after being benched for their last encounter for being slightly late to training. That arrived just a few days on from his stunning brace in the Champions League against Newcastle.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has issued an update to Instagram.",
      "The 20-year-old, who wanted to leave the club on loan this past summer, has been a trending topic in recent weeks with his future seeming uncertain. However, MEN Sport have since revealed that he is working hard at Carrington to impress Ruben Amorim having also hired a new private chef.",
      "The latest update has come on his Instagram story with Mainoo reposting an update from Leny Yoro that shows the duo together in a number of photos. Mainoo is also in the replies of the French defender's post.",
      "A post shared by YL15 (@lenyyoro)",
      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Amad and Noussair Mazraoui will both miss Manchester United's trip to Brentford in the Premier League.",
      "\"Licha [Lisandro Martinez} is out. Casemiro is out because of the red card. Amad is not here because someone in his family passed away. We are giving all the support to Amad and understood he needed to return home,\" he said.",
      "Diogo Dalot is in line to replace Amad with the Portugal international returning to training on Thursday. Mazraoui meanwhile, has been ruled out.",
      "\"He [Mazraoui] is out also. He will not be back until the international break,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with moves for Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba of Crystal Palace and Brighton, respectively.",
      "When speaking on the United Stand, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a verdict on interest in both.",
      "At the moment I'm not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deeper-lying midfielder if anything, should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "With the likes of Wharton and Baleba, we know that they're going to be in demand. With Carls Baleba, there's going to be two aspects.",
      "One is naturally the market pushing towards trying to sign him with multiple suitors, and Manchester United fans shouldn't be surprised by that.",
      "The second aspect is obviously price, and even though many may feel £100m is a lot of money and something that could get a deal done, Brighton's data and Brighton's approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moisés Caicedo-type fee, £150m or more in 12 months' time.",
      "I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. I don't see a January sale for Carlos Baleba. The slow start to the season has maybe been influenced by some of the summer speculation.",
      "There's other names that could be available mid season if Manchester United have the funds from potentially a Kobbie Mainoo exit, we'll have to wait and see what transpires.",
      "Manchester United could face competition for the signature of Carlos Baleba if they opt to actively pursue his services next summer.",
      "Interest in the Brighton star was made clear towards the latter stages of the most recent trading period and now SportsBoom are claiming that Spurs have joined the race for Baleba but that he still would prefer a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Alternatives for United include Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton.",
      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United news and transfers live blog brought to you by MEN Sport.",
      "Transfer rumours have continued to circulate around Old Trafford with a move for a marquee midfielder expected. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton features very high on the club's shortlist.",
      "There is also plenty to look at regarding the futures of Marcus Rashford and Kobbie Mainoo following very different weeks for the two United academy graduates.",
      "To also learn of the latest updates ahead of the trip to Brentford!",
      "Further to the update surrounding Baleba, Jacobs gave United a boost in their hopes to sign Wharton in the summer.",
      "The journalist believes that Wharton has a gentleman's agreement with Palace to leave the club at the end of this season.",
      "Should this be the case, it would be a shock if United do not try and pursue a move for the ex-Blackburn Rovers man.",
      "Some nerves have been jangled recently after reports emerged suggesting that Liverpool were willing to challenge United to sign Carlos Baleba next summer.",
      "However, journalist Ben Jacobs understands this is not the case.",
      "Talking to The United Stand, Jacobs claimed that Liverpool are not looking at the possibility of adding a deeper midfielder due to the ongoing success of Ryan Gravenberch.",
      "Panic soon began to spread after Obi was dropped to the bench to face Athletic Club especially after he made a promising breakthrough into the first team squad last season.",
      "But speaking recently to the MEN, academy head coach Travis Binnion urged fans to be patient with the striker and his development.",
      "It's not easy for him because people look at him like he's a big kid. The key thing there is he's still very young, he's still learning his game. Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that. The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball. They [City] will say they are not scared of him, but they defended two versus one against him all day. I'm pleased he got his goal because you can toil up there, not touch it, not do a lot, but he got his goal and set us on our way. I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Obi was rested against Athletic Bilbao this week for the U21s.",
      "The striker seemed disappointed as he was named on the bench for the contest against the Basque club in the Premier League International Cup.",
      "However, it is understood the decision was made to rest him due to United's U21s having a busy schedule.",

      "Manchester United are said to have drawn up fresh plans for the new Old Trafford and removed the canopy from their plans after it caused controversy when the new designs were revealed earlier this year.",
      "Concept images and videos of the club's 100,000-seater stadium was revealed in March, featuring a vast, umbrella-like canopy - designed to create a modern, sustainable destination alongside a public plaza. The canopy, supported by three masts, would be visible from the outskirts of Liverpool on a clear day.",
      "At the time, it brought mixed reaction with United's fanbase. Critics described the massive structure to a circus tent, and the canopy alone was estimated to cost between £300million and £400m to construct and install.",
      "Fast forward a few months and the club are considering different options for their new stadium, according to The Athletic. It's reported that the so-called 'vast umbrella' was scrapped due to space constraints.",
      "\"The brief to Norman Foster here was to build the world’s most iconic football stadium,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe explained at the time. \"It had to be a stadium which was recognisable around the world.",
      "\"We said to [architect] Norman that we would like a stadium where when anybody in the world sees that stadium, they’ll know it's Manchester United. It’s more than a new stadium.",
      "\"Everyone knows the Eiffel Tower, everyone wants to visit. Everyone in the world will want to come visit this stadium. I think the design of the stadium is a 10 out of 10. I think it’s a really special design.\"",
      "Following a review, sources have reportedly described the updated designs as more in keeping with traditional stadium aesthetics. However, discussions are still said to be ongoing and Foster's design is 'still on the table.'",
      "Discussions are believed to have taken place with Freightliner, which owns much of the land to the west of the current stadium that had been earmarked for part of the new stadium footprint and around 17,000 homes.",
      "However, the report adds that Freightliner is demanding around £400million ($535m) for the land and while the company are reputedly willing to relocate the freight terminal to a new site, it is 'so far holding out for a major windfall.'",
      "But if United now move forward without the canopy, the project would require less Freightliner land, allowing construction to progress more quickly.",
      "Meanwhile, the stadium's exact location is also under consideration, as each option requires 'different amounts and configurations of land.'",
      "\"The government has identified infrastructure investment as a strategic priority, particularly in the north of England, and we are proud to be supporting that mission with this project of national, as well as local, significance,\" Ratcliffe said after United launched their campaign for government funding.",

      "Since Ineos invested in the club, there has been increased activity in markets outside of Europe. Sekou Kone was signed from Mali in 2024, Diego Leon arrived from Paraguay this summer and United have struck a preliminary agreement to sign Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco.",
      "The defensive midfielder plays for Fortaleza CEIF, has captained Colombia's Under-17 team and helped his nation reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring.",
      "United have identified Orozco as an exciting young talent with potential to progress to the first-team. However, Orozco will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year, so he will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July.",

      "Kone was signed for around £1m from Mali club Guidars FC. He was first scouted by United in November 2023 at the Under-17 World Cup in Indonesia. Multiple staff members watched Kone throughout that tournament as Mali beat Argentina to claim a third-place finish.",
      "Having followed Kone at the U17 World Cup, another United scout attended an Under-18 tournament in Morocco in April 2024 where Kone featured as one of the players of the tournament. It's understood the recommendation to sign Kone came after this tournament.",
      "The likelihood is that Orozco was tracked by United at the U17 South American Championship. Scouts were impressed by Kone's displays for Mali and Orozco has shown great potential with Colombia.",
      "Orozco will arrive in Manchester with a similar profile to Kone: young, raw and possessing huge potential. These kinds of transfers are essentially low risk and high reward for United.",
      "The best-case scenario is that a signing breaks into the first team and establishes himself in the Premier League. The worst-case scenario is that he is below first-team standard but is still sold for a profit.",
      "United are planning for the future and trying to explore markets further afield more often. Other Premier League clubs have made more use of non-European markets and have landed some gems.",
      "Brighton have been the standard-setting team in the league for recruitment for some time now, and the Seagulls' data-driven approach has unearthed some wonderfully gifted players.",
      "United wanted to sign Moises Caicedo in December 2020, but the £5.5m asking price was too steep. Brighton agreed a deal and sold Caicedo to Chelsea just two-and-a-half years later for £115m.",
      "Ineos' decision-makers will be praised if Kone, Leon or Orozco can develop their games like Caicedo did. The only downside is they need time and patience to grow, which is something rarely afforded at United.",
      "Jason Wilcox is hugely influential behind the scenes and different sources have indicated he was already doing the director of football job before he was officially given the title.",
      "In February, United appointed Christopher Vivell as director of recruitment on a full-time basis following his interim spell in the role and he became a regular attendee of academy games.",

      "Al Wahda FC have until the end of the weekend to agree on a deal to sign Manchester United youngster Sam Mather.",
      "Mather received an offer from Al Wahda after missing out on a permanent move to Kayserispor.",
      "United have insisted on including a buy-back clause into the deal, which is common practice for departures from the academy, and the transfer hinges on whether the UAE club agree to that clause.",
      "Al Wahda have been told they must decide this weekend or Mather will stay at United.",
      "The UAE side have been informed of the deadline so there is no more uncertainty for the youngster.",
      "Mather has trained with the first team at Carrington all week ahead of the Brentford game, raising the possibility of the 21-year-old being named on the bench at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Casemiro is suspended, Noussair Mazraoui has been ruled out due to injury, and Amad will stay at home in Manchester while he continues to receive support following a family bereavement.",
      "Kayserispor were in advanced talks to sign Mather on Turkey's transfer deadline day, but United felt they didn't have enough time to complete the transfer and the deal collapsed.",
      "Mather targeted a move to Europe throughout the summer window and received enquiries from clubs in Germany, Sweden and Turkey.",
      "The winger has outgrown academy football and wants to compete in a senior environment. Playing in the AFC Champions League would be a sweetener for Mather to make the switch to the UAE.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has praised both Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw for their reactions following Roy Keane's scathing critique of the latter following Manchester United's defeat to Manchester City. After the loss at the Etihad Stadium, Keane held no punches when assessing Shaw's performance.",
      "He concluded that the full-back turned centre-back had 'given up' during the contest, which led to a goal, and that the England international had 'got away with murder' for years at United. Such criticism from Keane after a loss is nothing new, but Shaw chose to address the comments following the victory over Chelsea at Old Trafford a week later.",
      "Shaw explained that he agreed with the former captain's feedback and that he 'did not need Keane to tell him' when his performances were not up to scratch. Maguire made his 250th appearance for United against City, and after being celebrated prior to the Chelsea win, the defender insisted that Shaw is an 'excellent player' as he launched a stern defence of his teammate.",
      "Speaking exclusively to MEN Sport ahead of fronting Talking Future's new initiative Half Time Talks, Ferdinand heaped praise on the United duo for how they responded to Keane's comments.",
      "\"Personally I think it is great from Harry Maguire because that is the job of a captain/senior player to come in and defend your players if you think that they are being unfairly treated,\" he said. \"I also think Luke Shaw coming out and speaking himself is what I like.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I like to see players come out and go: ‘You know what, I am not having that or actually, they are right. I was under par for the level that I have set myself.’",
      "\"I am sure he will put in a performance this week Luke Shaw that will make you think: ‘He is made of the right stuff.’ I just think that Luke Shaw is a magnificently talented player, he has just been so unfortunate with injuries that he has never been able to maintain his fitness and it goes back to that word again, consistency.",
      "\"If you can’t be consistent with appearances and being available, it is going to be difficult for you to really stamp your authority and really sustain the level of performances that is required for a top club.\"",
      "Both Shaw and Maguire will be hoping to impress on Saturday lunchtime when the Premier League returns with a trip to Brentford for the Reds.",

      "Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has admitted he was shocked that Manchester United didn't pursue a move for Nicolas Jackson. United were mooted with a move for the Senegal international during the summer transfer window as his future looked set to be away from Chelsea.",
      "However, a move didn't materialise with Bayern Munich eventually managing to get a deal over the line in a dramatic twist - following uncertainty after injury to Liam Delap. Ruben Amorim's side were one of the busier clubs in the market and their area of focus was on attacking firepower with Benjamin Sesko joining Bryan Mbeumo and Mathues Cunha.",
      "Though, only the former Brentford striker has found the back of the net in the opening five Premier League matches while Cunha returned from injury for the 2-1 win over Chelsea.",
      "Hasselbaink netted 87 goals in 177 appearances for the Stamford Bridge club, and he rushed to Jackson's defence, claiming that he was surprised that he wasn't the target for a move to United or Newcastle.",
      "\"I’ve always liked Nicolas Jackson,\" he began speaking to Betway. \"I think he could bring something to the team, but obviously two strikers have come in and he felt that he was not going to play as much as he was.",
      "\"He wanted to leave and you can understand that. I think Chelsea were happy to sell him.",
      "\"I was just surprised that Newcastle or Man Utd didn’t try to get him.",
      "\"But he asked to leave, and I don’t know what I can say about that really. He’s at another club outside of England and I think Chelsea wish him well.\"",
      "Jackson completed a move to Bavaria on deadline day, in a deal which will keep him at the Bundesliga side on loan until the end of the season.",
      "Reports suggest that the 24-year-old's short-term switch will become permanent if he makes a set number of appearances - landing Chelsea £56.2million for the former Villarreal talisman.",
      "However, he has yet to find the back of the net in his first three appearances in Germany, including a late cameo against his parent club in the Champions League as Harry Kane's double saw off Enzo Maresca's side in a 3-1 win.",
      "Sesko is also goalless in his early United career after a slow start to life in the Premier League. The 22-year-old has made six appearances, one in the Carabao Cup, starting in his last two top-flight outings but failing to find the target with Amorim's side enduring an indifferent start to the campaign.",
      "Despite his stuttering start to life in M16, the Portuguese tactician has already defended him in an exciting admission.",
      "\"When you are in a club like this, you want to have the best players but you also have to imagine the future,\" he said at the end of last month.",
      "\"That is so exciting – I like to know the players, I like to see the videos of the players and to try to get all the information, but you want that confirmation and I felt Sesko was even better than what I was thinking.",
      "\"I have to be careful, Sesko is going to be our striker for many, many years so we need to put that in his head and let him settle down, to stay calm and enjoy his day because he’s really like you said, obsessed.",
      "\"I’m really happy – not just with him but with Cunha, Diego (Leon), and Mbeumo – we know that we have the players and we know that in our future we are going to have that base and that is really important for us.\"",

      "Former Manchester United striker Danny Webber has backed Benjamin Sesko following the Slovenian's slow start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old arrived at United from RB Leipzig in the recent summer transfer window for a fee which could rise to £73.7million. The Reds beat Champions League side Newcastle United to Sesko's signature, with Arsenal also interested in the striker before opting to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead.",
      "Sesko has endured a slow start to life at M16, with no goals in six appearances for Ruben Amorim's team so far. The Slovenian international was also substituted at half-time against Chelsea last weekend after Casemiro's sending off shortly before the break.",
      "And one player who will know about the striker position at United and its challenges is Webber, who made three appearances for the Reds between 2000 and 2003.",
      "\"I feel it's sometimes unfair for Sesko, and I felt the same with [Rasmus] Hojlund. When you're asking somebody at that age to come in and be the starter for Man United and lead the line - it's an unfair expectation. The price tags would suggest differently because that's the market, and as a striker, it's such a specialist position that you need to know how to play it.",
      "\"If you look across the board, the strikers in the Premier League who have done well, you take Harry Kane for example, when he was in the Premier League, he did his legwork, he went to places where he didn't score so many goals, but everywhere you go, you're building and you're adding to your arsenal.",
      "\"Ollie Watkins, who has been a consistent performer now in the Premier League, did his legwork. You look at [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, who came in; they've gone and done their legwork prior, so none of them came in at 21, 22, and were just scoring 20 to 30 goals consistently every year.",
      "\"So I feel that it's a tough school for him to come in and just hit the ground running. That said, I do think he's got the ability to do so. It's got to come from him as well, and working at your game every day, analysing your video, having presence on the pitch, speaking to your team-mates, and telling them what you demand from them as a striker.",
      "\"He's had a slow start. Trying to acclimatise very quickly to the Premier League, and it doesn't help when you've not had a consistent preseason either. But I do think that he's got all the tools to be a very good striker for Manchester United. I do feel that he needs a bit of time.\"",
      "On United's season as a whole, Webber insists no one should be getting carried away but admits Amorim's side need to string a run of wins together to build some much-needed confidence.",
      "\"I think what you'll find in the Premier League this year is everybody will beat everybody. I know Liverpool are out on their own at this moment.",
      "\"In terms of United, you just have to literally, and it's very clichéd, focus on the next game and just try and improve and get things better and build a bit of momentum. It's been a while since the club's been on a run where they've won a lot of games consistently and feel that feeling of confidence going into every single game.",
      "\"I think that's gotta be the first step, looking at making sure we can win consecutive matches and put a smile back on everybody's face.\"",

      "The time has come for Ruben Amorim to put his faith in Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "United are five games into the new Premier League season and Mainoo has yet to start any of them, the midfielder having played just 76 minutes coming off the bench.",
      "An unused substitute in the first two league games, Mainoo's only start was in United's humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby.",
      "Even when Amorim deviated from his preferred central midfield pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes for the 3-0 derby defeat at Manchester City, dropping the former, Mainoo was overlooked, with Manuel Ugarte getting the nod ahead of him.",
      "The irony of that decision is that when Mainoo eventually did come on at the Etihad Stadium, just after the hour mark, he brought more energy and mobility to United's midfield, underlining the folly of Amorim's decision to start the hapless Ugarte over him.",
      "Now, with Casemiro suspended for Saturday's lunchtime trip to Brentford following his sending off in Saturday's chaotic 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford, Amorim has a major selection dilemma in midfield - whether to start Mainoo or Ugarte.",
      "Given Amorim has insisted he will continue to deploy skipper Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, despite it not playing to his attacking strengths, it seems a straight choice between Mainoo and Ugarte as to who partners him in the middle.",
      "Given Mainoo is not a holding midfielder and defensive duties are not second nature to him, it seems inevitable that Amorim will go with Ugarte for the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium, to give United greater security and a ball-winning mentality in the middle.",
      "Another option would be to play both Mainoo and Ugarte in central midfield, but given Amorim's reluctance to play Fernandes further forward and therefore displace one of his first-choice front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – all big-money summer signings – that scenario seems unlikely.",
      "Mainoo's desire to go out on loan before transfer deadline day, because of a lack of playing time, was entirely understandable, even if it gave the impression of a player with a questionable mentality, unwilling to prove himself and meet the challenge to fight for his place.",
      "At 19, Mainoo started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain but was not even included in Thomas Tuchel's latest Three Lions squad because of his outcast status at United. In a World Cup year, Mainoo's fear that he will miss out on next summer's tournament in the US is entirely justified, if Amorim continues to overlook him.",
      "The Brentford game, therefore, is the perfect platform for Amorim to show he means it when he says he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, even though he has pointed out the young prodigy still has to improve in many areas, not least in his defensive mindset, tracking back and positional discipline.",
      "But on Saturday, with Casemiro unavailable and Mainoo relishing the chance to start a first league game of the season, Amorim has the opportunity to change the dynamic of United's team. Given Amorim's pragmatism and unwillingness to change from his formation and personnel, Mainoo is primed for more disappointment, but starting him may be the bold step that can finally kickstart United's season.",

United were underwhelming in the Manchester derby, losing 3-0 to their fierce rivals. And, unsurprisingly after such a heavy loss, the critics were out in force to pick apart the Reds' failings.",
      "One man who caught particular criticism from Keane was Shaw. The former United captain insisted the full-back, who is currently being utilised in a three-man defence, 'gave up' allowing Phil Foden to score. Addressing those criticisms after defeating Chelsea a week later, Shaw admitted: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin.",
      "\"He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player.",

      "Maguire is obviously no stranger to being criticised while playing for United. When he was captain, the Englishman was often mocked online, taking the criticism of him to a whole new level.",
      "In an interview with United's official club website after surpassing 250 appearances for the club, Maguire defended Shaw.",
      "\"You don’t play at this club 250 or 300 times if you’re first and foremost not a good player,\" the centre-back explained.",
      "\"Luke’s an excellent footballer, and every manager that comes in, he gets questioned a lot. That’s what happens at this club.",

      "Carreras was on the books at Old Trafford from 2020 until 2024 after being picked up by United's academy from Real Madrid. However, the Spaniard was not given much of a chance to impress in the first-team.",
      "The left-back never made a senior appearance for the Reds and was loaned to Preston North End and Granada before an eventual spell at Benfica revitalised his career. After enjoying half a season in Portugal, Carreras signed permanently with them in the summer of 2024.",
      "His only full season in Portugal proved to be a hit and Real chose to strike while the iron was hot and snapped the full-back up. Now back in the Spanish capital, Carreras has been impressing and Alonso cannot help but praise the former United man.",
      "\"I was optimistic [about his signing],\" Alonso told the media on Monday. \"His personality and competitive nature have pleasantly surprised me.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He makes very few mistakes, he is very focused, he has great mental quality, great tactical and technical quality too, he is very complete. The instant impact he has had is surprising, it is fantastic news.",
      "\"We also have Fran [Garcia] and Ferland [Mendy] for that position, but his performance is excellent.\" Carreras has not missed a minute in La Liga for Los Blancos this season and that form has led to his value sky-rocketing.",
      "According to transfermarkt, Carreras has a market value of £30.5m after being snapped up for £43m in the summer by Real. United full-back Diogo Dalot meanwhile, who has been an ever-present at Old Trafford and has been utilised at both right and left wing-back prior to his injury, is only worth £26m in the current market.",
      "As for Patrick Dorgu, who was signed by Ruben Amorim to be the first choice on the left flank, he has a current market value of £21.8m. After Carreras signed for Real in the summer, United did manage to bank an extra £7.5m thanks to their sell-on clause but they may well come to regret selling him.",

      "The spell at Villa Park managed to revitalise Rashford and managed to earn him a season-long loan to Barcelona this season. At the beginning of the summer, the duo informed the Reds that they wished to leave the club.",
      "Sancho had been expected to join Chelsea permanently at the end of last season but he was returned to Old Trafford after failing to reach an agreement with Enzo Maresca's side on his wage. It has been claimed that the former Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund man contacted Rashford to discuss moving to Villa.",
      "Rashford is thought to have given the West Midlands club a glowing recommendation and the deal was completed at the start of this month. On Sunday, Sancho made his first appearance for Villa in the Premier League but it did not go according to plan as Unai Emery's side failed to beat 10-man Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Reflecting on the fixture on Tuesday afternoon, Sancho wrote: \"Unfortunate not to get the win over the weekend, head up and go again to make things right!\" Rashford was quick to send his support to his former teammate, replying with a red heart emoji to the winger's message.",
      "Sancho will be hoping to receive further minutes for Villa on Thursday night when his new team host Bologna in their opening Europa League fixture of the season.",

      "Christian Eriksen believes former Manchester United players can be too critical in the media.",
      "Eriksen said goodbye to Old Trafford on the final day of last season. He wrote a farewell post on social media to thank United fans for their support during his three seasons at the club.",
      "The creative midfielder won the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in Manchester. Eriksen's contract with United officially expired at the end of July and he signed for German club Wolfsburg on a free transfer.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Eriksen reflected on his time at the club and suggested recent trophy wins have been underappreciated because of United's successful history.",
      "Eriksen said: \"It probably depends who you ask. If you ask a fan, they want to be back to winning the league every year for the next 20 years like they did... this time of football it is almost impossible, to do that with so many other clubs having that many good players around. It's tough.",
      "\"I think obviously they want to get back to that to being stable as a top club, but even being there, winning the FA Cup and the Carabao in the last two seasons is something that any other club would be proud to have done.",
      "\"Then there is also the size and the image and the feeling at United - it's like it's not good enough. I think hopefully that will change. Even the Carabao [Cup] is a small thing, but at that moment it is a big thing.\"",
      "When asked about whether the opinion of ex-players has an impact on United, Eriksen said: \"You see how big the club is, how much people want to be involved with the club, even on the media attention. I think even now we speak about United here. It's just the power of the club.",
      "\"Obviously the more opinionated, the more feelings towards the club are negative, the tougher it is, because the fans follow their heroes on the TV and it doesn't help the players at the club.",
      "\"At the same time at United, as a footballer, there's always someone who has an opinion on one or the other, but you're just playing football. You try to focus on that bit, and I think United were good at that. The focus was on the game itself and not so much what people say.\"",
      "Roy Keane criticised Luke Shaw after the Manchester derby, claiming he \"gave up\" for Phil Foden's opening goal before suggesting the defender \"has been getting away with murder for years.\".",
      "Speaking after the Chelsea win, Shaw responded: \"I think people have opinions. Sometimes you just have to take it on the chin. He’s got a lot of experience, he was one of the best captains ever for Manchester United and, of course, it hurts. But for me criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it but I think he was right.",
      "\"Last week, I wasn’t at my level at all and I don’t need Roy Keane to tell me. After the game, I knew that. But of course it hurts. The most important thing is knowing how good I can be and I think the manager knows that and the managers who I played under in the past know that.",
      "\"I’m always in the team, I’m always playing, so there must be something the managers [see and] must believe in me. I’m not getting any younger and I need to be consistent, I’ve had lots of ups and downs and it’s about keeping that consistently high level because I know I can do that.",
      "\"And that’s why last week hurt me a lot because I know that’s not my level and I think the criticism is completely understandable, I take it on the chin and listen to it and I move on.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is a man now famed for his honesty in press conferences. If anything, he’s too honest.",
      "The Manchester United chiefs weren’t all that enamoured with his response to questions about Kobbie Mainoo’s future, for example, nor his threats last season to walk away from the club if results didn’t improve.",
      "That integrity is a key part of his charisma, which was supposedly a key draw for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses when selecting the Portuguese boss as their replacement for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But again, with Brentford incredibly offering up an opportunity for Amorim to earn back-to-back Premier League wins for the very first time, when asked by a reporter in the press conference what the key to consistency is for Manchester United, we would advise Amorim against “complete honesty” when it’s an admission of ignorance.",
      "“It is normal that the fans don’t know what is going to happen in the next game. To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don’t know how it’s going to be and I’m the manager of the team! The best way of dealing with that is every game is the last one.”",
      "We enjoy self-deprecation as much as anyone, and understand that it’s no more than a jovial, throwaway comment from a man under pressure; someone quite frankly embarrassed that after ten months in charge of one of the biggest clubs in world football he’s yet to win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Without similarly cheeky lines he may not still be in the job, with his press conference manner the key to this aura of stability and confidence he’s managed to fabricate for himself despite the chaos on the pitch.",

      "And of course, like any other football manager, he doesn’t really know what’s going to happen in any game. It’s presumably why he loves football, if he does indeed still love it.",
      "But five games into a new season in which there’s been no great sign of progress after leading them in their worst campaign in living memory, not knowing whether his team is going to be any good or not feels awfully close to the bone of contention that he doesn’t know how to turn things around at Old Trafford.",
      "No Manchester United fan will be turning up for this clash at Brentford tomorrow with any clue as to how their team perform on a scale from not bad to terrible, but should the manager not have more than “an idea”? Or at least put the brutal honesty on hold and claim that he does?",
      "Because as much as anything, we’re not sure it’s an admission the famously fragile Manchester United players will be using as any great motivation to break this two-game hoodoo."

      "We must be honest and concede that it’s not quite as chunky a Big Weekend as the last couple, but it’s another where the fixture computer’s capriciousness could leave Arsenal again fearing the worst and playing catch-up at a ground with bad recent memories for Arteta and co.",
      "Meanwhile every weekend is Big for Big Ange Postecoglou as he has another stab at getting a first win to go with all the lovely attacking football he’s got Forest playing now.",
      "And in not unrelated news, beleaguered Wolves head to London hoping for a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham.",
      "",
      "We once again find ourselves with some degree of sympathy for Arsenal and the machinations of the fixture computer. Liverpool once again have first-mover advantage on a weekend when Arsenal’s task is a difficult one.",
      "Liverpool have no penalty kick themselves at Selhurst Park, but if they can win – via late shirt-removing methods or otherwise – then Arsenal face another Sunday afternoon when any slight slip will come with outsized consequences.",
      "Arsenal could be eight points adrift by the time they kick off at a stadium where their recent record is not good. Arsenal lost twice at St James’ Park last season without scoring a goal, in the league and again in the Carabao Cup semi-finals, extending a record in Newcastle that now reads one win and four defeats on their last five visits.",
      "For Newcastle, this game represents a test of what has been a few weeks of tentative promise since the cruel late defeat to Liverpool. That was a game that featured 83 per cent of all goals scored in Premier League games involving Newcastle this season. Three of their other four games have finished goalless, along with a 1-0 home win over hapless Wolves.",
      "This is a game that should give a pretty clear indication of whether the last few weeks have represented recovery and growth, or just not playing any of the top teams for a bit. At least domestically; there was plenty of encouragement too in a narrow Champions League defeat to Barcelona.",
      "The fact Liverpool have already won here adds another dash of intrigue and jeopardy for Arsenal; it already feels like an achievement that even at this early stage they must match. And a game where all evidence from Newcastle’s efforts outside that Liverpool defeat suggest Mikel Arteta will simply have to release that infamous handbrake of his.",
      "",
      "We’re really not sure how much longer Viktor Gyokeres scoring the wrong kind of goals is going to keep providing a covering narrative for the fact the big-money striker Man United chose after missing out on the Swede still doesn’t have any goals, at all, against anyone up to and including Grimsby Town.",
      "Sesko played the full 90 minutes of that match before infamously stepping up as the last outfield player to take a penalty for United in the dignity-sapping shoot-out that followed.",
      "While he’s been more sporadically used in the Premier League, he has nevertheless now played a tick under 300 minutes of football for United without a goal or assist to his name.",
      "It’s not Sesko’s fault that United paid what they paid for him, nor that he is the latest pawn in the wider United banter circus.",
      "But he’s going to need to start helping himself soon, and a Saturday lunchtime trip to a hollowed-out Brentford side who have shipped seven goals in their last three Premier League games represents just about as good a chance as any at this point.",
      "If anything, has the great man’s start at Nottingham Forest perhaps been too Postecoglou? We really don’t want to complain, or indeed to appear greedy and ungrateful, but it has felt like all the key elements of Postecoglou’s football have been crammed into the last few weeks.",
      "Forest have started playing some truly gorgeous attacking football, and some truly catastrophic defensive football. They have failed to defend leads against teams as diverse as Swansea, Burnley and Real Betis, while the hamstring injuries that plagued Big Ange’s riotously entertaining two years at Tottenham are already making an unwanted appearance in Nottingham.",
      "Sunderland at home would have been a fixture most teams were chalking up as three points when the computer spat out the schedule back in June, but a lot has changed for both Sunderland and Forest since then.",
      "It’s an awkwardly big game now for Postecoglou, with last weekend’s failure to put Burnley away exacerbated by the same failing in the Europa League in midweek.",
      "There are many reasons why Postecoglou is currently a fixture in the manager to watch slot. One, it’s just pretty much always entertaining and who doesn’t enjoy that? But a second reason is the clear and certain sense that we should enjoy it while we can, because it doesn’t feel likely that Angeball is back on any kind of long-term basis.",
      "We’re not yet in must-win territory, even for Mr Marinakis, but there is a sense of ‘if not now, when?’ about Postecoglou’s quest for a first victory with his new club. After Sunderland, it’s Midtjylland and Newcastle before the October international break and Chelsea, Porto, Bournemouth, Manchester United, Sturm Graz, Leeds, Liverpool and Malmo before the end of November.",
      "Manchester United should provide few problems, given Postecoglou’s formline there, but with the rest of that run of games it doesn’t require a vivid imagination to picture it all spiralling rapidly out of control.",
      "",
      "Five defeats to begin the Premier League season, which extends Vitor Pereira’s side’s overall winless league run to nine vexing matches since the giddy spring days of winning six in a row.",
      "With Wolves’ own deep woes and a squad left woefully under-powered after a difficult summer exacerbated by clear signs of life at all three promoted clubs, you already find yourself wondering how much longer the club can afford to wait before taking decisive action to arrest the slide and save their season.",
      "It feels wild to be talking this way given just how adroitly Pereira steered Wolves out of trouble back in March and April, but the drop-off has been gargantuan and the context of that six-game winning run starting to look slightly different.",
      "It was a run that featured all three relegated sides as well as West Ham, Manchester United and Tottenham who were very much the worst of the non-relegated teams in the second half of last season.",
      "Six straight wins is still six straight wins, but there has to be some acknowledgement they came against the six easiest possible opponents with very little scope for hope or optimism since.",
      "Until now. It’s Spurs again for Wolves this weekend and, while they do look a very different and less banterous beast under Thomas Frank, they are still Tottenham. The Doctor will see you now.",
      "",
      "A key midlands derby between two teams with clear Premier League ambitions, Coventry having lost out in the play-offs in two out of the last three seasons while remaining unbeaten in the Championship this season under Frank Lampard, and Birmingham’s targeting of back-to-back promotions back to the big time long since certain to be one of the EFL’s key talking points this season.",
      "Coventry could do with turning draws into wins, while Birmingham are still yet to truly settle on their best XI in a brave new world, yet both can be reasonably content with how things are shaping up, both reaching ten points after six games to sit in and around the play-off spots at this early stage.",
      "",
      "The two Madrid giants have made wildly contrasting starts in La Liga thus far, with Real Madrid currently boasting a flawless 18 points from their opening six games but Atleti managing only half that.",

      "There is no imaginable football where this isn’t a big game, albeit that as far as the women’s game is currently concerned the balance of power lies rather differently to the men’s. United have made a fine start to the new WSL season after a pair of handsome wins over Leicester and London City and a creditable goalless draw against Arsenal.",
      "Liverpool, meanwhile, still await their first point after a humbling Merseyside Derby defeat to Everton and then going down at Leicester after the hosts were reduced to 10 early in the second half.",

      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Manchester United remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd made a late move for Baleba, 21, in the summer transfer window after spending over £200million on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There have been reports of Liverpool competing with the Red Devils for Baleba’s signature, but transfer expert Jacobs poured cold water on that.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder. Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder,” he told The United Stand.",
      "Jacobs added that Man Utd did a lot of “legwork” in August, making it very unlikely they will walk away from their pursuit of Baleba next year.",
      "“One of the reasons they (Man Utd) did all the legwork over the final weeks of the window was to try and put themselves in the strongest possible position, because I think they will be moving for Carlos Baleba,” he continued.",
      "MORE: Man Utd choose ‘elite’ manager as ‘prime candidate’ to replace Amorim amid two reasons for verdict",
      "“You don’t commit to what would have been potentially a 100 million-plus spend and then just walk away, because there’ll be a point in 12 months’ time where that player is for sale.",
      "“Even though many may feel 100 million is a lot of money, and something that could get a deal done, Brighton’s data and approach is to think this is a player that might be a Moises Caicedo-type fee, 115 million or more in 12 months’ time.",
      "“That projection of value effectively priced Baleba out of the market and stopped anybody bidding, because Brighton felt no one is going to match the valuation, and therefore the player is simply not for sale.",
      "“So if Manchester United want Carlos Baleba, but they don’t have to worry about Liverpool or anyone else, they have to worry about probably finding 100-plus million, maybe even closer to 115 or 120 million, hoping that Brighton want to sell, which is far more likely in a year’s time.",
      "“If it isn’t Liverpool, there’ll be other suitors for Baleba, and that’s the whole point really. Brighton think that, first of all, in a year’s time there’ll be multiple suitors, so the price goes up. Second of all, form, hopefully, from Brighton’s point of view in the next 12 months, also adds to the valuation.",
      "“With Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in. So could it be Baleba and [Adam] Wharton, or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Asked if Man Utd could bid for Baleba in January, Jacobs quickly quashed the idea.",
      "“I don’t see a January sale for Carlos Baleba, that’s the first thing to say,” he said.",
      "“The start to the season may have been influenced by some of the summer speculation. There’s no doubt his head was turned by Manchester United, but we’re so early in the season, I don’t think we can equate a dip in form with a dip in valuation, or a dip in form with a January exit.",
      "“Brighton have shown with several players that they sell when they want to, based on their own long-term plan, and the only thing that may alter the Baleba situation is the fact that David Weir unexpectedly left, and Jason Ayto, the former Arsenal interim sporting director, has come in. So there’s a new voice and consideration over what they do in the market.",
      "“But remember, January is very much a seller’s market. It’s difficult for buyers in a short space of time, and it’s mid-season, and we know Brighton’s approach is to sell on their terms, their timeline, their price.",
      "“In addition to that, with a replacement coming in — all of which would be hard to do in a January window — it would be a big shock if Baleba went anywhere in January. But I also think it’d be equally as big a shock if Brighton didn’t engage more seriously over a summer sale, because these players, when they join Brighton, know there will be a period in time where they can be sold and move on to another club.",
      "“With Baleba, the feeling is that if you look at the whole season, rather than just these first few games, come the end of the season, Brighton feel his valuation will be even higher than the number that they put over his head privately, but not to Manchester United.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’."

      "Ben Jacobs says Man Utd-linked midfielder Adam Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement” with Crystal Palace, meaning he can leave the club next summer.",
      "Wharton has impressed for Palace since signing from Blackburn Rovers in the January 2023/24 transfer window.",
      "Bought for an initial £18million, his outstanding form for the Eagles has seen his value soar to €45million (£39m) on Transfermarkt, though Palace are likely to only entertain offers worth at least £60m.",
      "Wharton was rewarded for his fine form with his England debut in June 2024 and a spot in Gareth Southgate’s squad for last summer’s European Championship.",
      "The 21-year-old didn’t feature for the Three Lions, who lost the final to Spain, despite intense clamour from supporters to see him play.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘leading race’ they’re going to lose to Man City, Liverpool for three midfielders",
      "Wharton showed elite mentality to bounce back from his international disappointment with a fantastic 2024/25 campaign, helping Palace win the FA Cup and finish 12th in the Premier League.",
      "He has been a crucial player under Oliver Glasner, who lost Ebere Eze to Arsenal in the summer transfer window after Eze scored the only goal in the FA Cup final against Manchester City.",
      "Glasner kept hold of club captain Marc Guehi after his transfer to Liverpool fell through, while Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wharton also stayed at Selhurst Park.",
      "Wharton was linked with a move away in the summer, but nothing materialised amid reported interest from Man Utd.",
      "However, a transfer at the end of this season now appears realistic, as Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement in place allowing him to leave Crystal Palace next summer,” according to transfer expert Ben Jacobs.",
      "Asked on The United Stand if Liverpool are interested in signing Man Utd-linked Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, Jacobs dropped the transfer bombshell regarding the Palace and England youngster.",
      "“I’m not really aware of Liverpool making a particular push for a deep-lying midfielder,” he said. “Should Liverpool add, it might be more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "“With the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba, we know that they’re going to be in demand.",
      "“My understanding with Wharton is there’s this kind of a gentleman’s agreement in place allowing him to leave Crystal Palace next summer. So that’s clearly going to be one to watch.",
      "“In the same way that Eberechi Eze, even though it wasn’t his release clause, was allowed to depart even after the release clause expired. I think Wharton could leave Crystal Palace next summer.”",
      "Jacobs also says that Man Utd could add two midfielders next summer after failing to land £100m-rated Baleba, with Bruno Fernandes potentially moving to Saudi Arabia and funding a big transfer window not ruled out.",
      "“And then with Manchester United and senior midfielders, I think there is a strong possibility that two come in,” he added.",
      "“Could it be Baleba and Wharton or two other senior midfielders? Absolutely. First of all, because Casemiro could still depart, even though he’s found favour under Ruben Amorim. Second of all, because Bruno Fernandes could go off to Saudi Arabia, and that could fund the window in 12 months’ time.”",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",
      "A new report claims Manchester United could sign an ‘elite’ player for *only* £60m in January, though this is utter nonsense…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are already ‘preparing’ a record ‘offer’ for Brighton star Carlos Baleba as they look to make an ‘historic signing’.",
      "Tottenham made a ‘late enquiry’ to sign Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta at the end of the transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are reportedly planning to break their transfer record in 2026 to bring Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba to Old Trafford as part of a double coup.",
      "Real Madrid could complicate Premier League transfer plans this summer with a move for a sought-after Crystal Palace star."

      "“The Manchester United job will still be attractive, whatever their current situation, still a huge club, huge fan base and obviously there has been financial backing in the transfer market as well for managers.",
      "“Iraola has done a remarkable job of Bournemouth, because he lost most of his top players this summer, but still really flourishing at Bournemouth.",
      "“Obviously, Bournemouth are looking to tie him down to a new contract.",
      "“They’re doing everything they can to agree terms and convince him to stay, because they don’t want to lose him, especially to a Premier League rival even if it is Man United.",

      "Paul Scholes won’t claim to speak for anyone. In the past, he barely spoke for himself and some, including Matt Stead, might recall the former midfielder’s mute period with some fondness. But while Scholes’ latest outburst has not been well received in some quarters, he succinctly summed up the feelings of many Manchester United fans towards another of their former heroes.",
      "Scholes labelled Marcus Rashford a ‘disgrace’ for his conduct, demeanour and perceived levels of effort towards the end of his Old Trafford career. Strong words from Scholes at a time he just so happens to be launching a new podcast.",
      "Maybe it is a cynical soundbite carefully crafted by Scholes to amplify the platform more than the message. However thick he might be laying it on, there will be plenty who watched Rashford ‘walking…not trying’ that broadly agree with his sentiment.",
      "Rashford really ought to have been carried out of Old Trafford shoulder high, if he had to leave at all. The academy graduate was a hometown hero turned national treasure for feeding hungry kids and bothering Tories. For the relationship between Rashford and his boyhood club to turn so sour, there are many with questions to answer.",
      "Steady rightly points the finger at United, a ‘broken club’ with a ‘corroded culture’. He’s right. Rashford’s United is a sh*tshow compared to Scholes’s.",
      "But at some point, individuals have to be held accountable rather than just attributing failure to some mysterious, ruinous post-Fergie curse. Rightly, flak is flung at the boardroom and axes swung at managers. The players? They cop it too, mostly for the crime of not being fit to lace the boots of Scholes, Butt, Keane, Beckham, Neville. Many of today’s squad, promoted above their levels and high above their ceiling, are being damned by comparison.",
      "But what about the ones who do have the talent to follow in those illustrious footsteps? And those who were reared to view The United Way as a concept vastly different to what it currently represents?",
      "Rashford is one of a few who ticked both boxes. It would have pained him to see what the club was becoming but, unlike the fans, he was in a position to lead a change. The extra adoration reserved for academy graduates also comes with the responsibility of maintaining the standards set by those that came before.",
      "Instead, as Scholes put it, Rashford ‘quit on United’. Whether he was exasperated or not, the evidence offers no other conclusion.",
      "Over 18 months, Rashford’s actions and demeanour spoke of a player who steadily gave up on his club. Repeated disciplinary breaches, the barely-arsed body language… the writing was on the wall long before Henry Winter posted it on X.",
      "When Ruben Amorim arrived last November, Rashford was certainly not alone in giving the impression that just going through the motions was too much to ask.",
      "The rotten standards prompted anger from supporters towards many players, most notably Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho. But those faces are quickly forgotten. The disappointment and regret over Rashford inevitably lingers.",
      "No doubt he was held to a higher standard. Hardly unfair when you consider Rashford’s pedigree and his status as one of the club’s highest earners. But in the end, the bare minimum was too much bother, an attitude that prompted some sympathy, some acrimony, but now mostly apathy towards the one-time local hero.",
      "“I really struggle to feel happy for him,” said Scholes, a stance that angered Steady and a few more besides. Including The i’s Pete Hall, who writes that Scholes’ criticism and previous narratives around Rashford amount to ‘bullying’. Knowing Pete, once of these parts, that’s a genuine belief. And given his leaning towards United, it highlights that no view on Rashford is unanimous.",
      "The witch-hunt in the right-wing media which attempted to smear Rashford amid the activism that prompted so much pride among United fans – that was bullying. Calling out his woefully-slipping standards as a footballer, one awarded one of the highest contracts in the history of his club, is not.",
      "So there are plenty of Stretford Enders who would echo Scholes’s sentiment. And that’s a reasonable reaction – human, even – in the circumstances. Only the most bitter would take satisfaction should Rashford flop at Barcelona, but neither should United fans be made to feel as though they ought to be cheering him on at the Nou Camp after he chose the path of disinterest out of Old Trafford.",
      "Rashford’s thunderb*stard at Newcastle in the Champions League last week will have caused many eyes in Manchester to roll. For United fans know better than anyone how Rashford is capable of such moments of brilliance having witnessed plenty for themselves. But those eyes will have rolled all the way back when news emerged of what followed next.",
      "With a brace at St James’ Park to build upon following an otherwise inauspicious start at Barca, Rashford turned up late for duty the following matchday. By two minutes, apparently.",
      "The level of his tardiness does not matter, especially when it is part of a pattern of behaviour. When you have unquestionably fallen upwards to a club as prestigious as Barca, where judgements are still being drawn by a new, hard-to-please manager, team-mates and fans, it is damning that it did not occur to him to be in at 9am, rather than skirting close enough to the 9.30am deadline to miss it.",
      "Damning but no longer surprising. Which goes a long way to explaining why Scholes and many others are returning the indifference that dripped off Rashford as he sloped towards the United exit.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Nottingham Forest are absolutely rattling through all the giddy highs and infuriating lows that come with Ange Postecoglou. It is captivating to watch."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘handed a dream scenario’ regarding Harry Kane, while they are ‘very close to’ their next signing.",
      "Kane is a long-term Man Utd target and they targeted the England international as he looked to leave Spurs during the 2023 summer transfer window.",
      "However, a move did not accelerate as Man Utd were unwilling to do business with Daniel Levy, so Kane joined Bayern Munich instead in a deal worth around £86m.",
      "Kane, unsurprisingly, has been a revelation at Bayern Munich, scoring 98 goals in his 103 appearances for the German giants. He has also won his first team trophy under Vincent Kompany, lifting the Bundesliga at the end of last season.",
      "Despite this, Kane has been heavily linked with a potential return to the Premier League in recent weeks.",
      "READ: Harry Kane is £56.7m no-brainer; he has always been only one rung below Messi",
      "It has been suggested that he could target a return to the Premier League to break Alan Shearer’s goalscoring record and he has an affordable ‘exit clause’ that becomes active next summer.",
      "Man Utd face potential competition from Spurs for Kane, though a report from The Daily Star claims the striker’s clause ‘hands’ the Red Devils a ‘dream transfer scenario’.",
      "The report claims that he is ‘expected to leave’ Bayern Munich next year, as he is ‘eager’ to return to the Premier League, while Man Utd are ‘potential suitors’.",
      "As well as Kane, Man Utd are also said to be looking to the future with their transfer business and Africa Foot are reporting that they have turned their attention to ‘Senegalese prodigy Mouhamed Dabo’.",
      "Dabo is the U17 captain for Senegal and the midfielder ‘has seduced the English club’s management with his raw talent and maturity’.",
      "The teenager is said to be ‘on trial’ at Man Utd and while Barcelona are ‘closely monitoring the situation’, he is ‘very close to signing’ for the Red Devils.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The player has been playing at Manchester United’s Carrington training ground for several weeks, where he’s been training with the youth teams. According to our information, the feedback has been very positive. The English club’s coaching staff has been impressed by his all-around skills: clean tackling, vision, composure, ball control, leadership, relentless work, progressive passing, and pace control.",
      "‘FC Barcelona hasn’t said its last word. The Catalan club is also closely monitoring the progress of Mouhamed Dabo, who completed a month-long internship at La Masia, Barça’s famous training centre, as revealed exclusively by Africafoot at the time. Seduced by his performances, the Spanish club is keeping a close eye on the case, even if Manchester United seems to have taken a head start.’",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly considering a move for Bayern and England superstar Harry Kane, who can leave the German club for less than £60m next summer.",
      "According to reports, Harry Kane has already reached an ‘agreement’ for his next move amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Gary Neville is doing his best to suggest Harry Kane might move to any other Premier League team other than Tottenham. Chelsea, anyone?",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",
      "Harry Kane has not become ‘more than a striker’ at Bayern Munich; he was always this brilliant but he remains underappreciated in England.",
      "Harry Kane reportedly has an exit clause in his Bayern contract that could attract the attention of Premier League clubs Man Utd and Spurs."

      "Obviously, Liverpool have benefited from some excellent finishing; they have outscored their xG by almost four goals.",
      "Now you might reasonably ask what XPts are.",
      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",
      "In a basic approach, xPts is calculated by simulating each shot in a match.",
      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",
      "So basically, it’s running the game through algorithms and working out the average of how many points should have been garnered from each match according to the xG created and the xG conceded.",
      "As Johns says: ‘The stat does well at giving us a decent idea of how many points a team should get on average, especially over a season.’",
      "Over the first five Premier League games, there is a shock name at the top of the Premier League xPts table, as calculated by Understat.",
      "Bournemouth have not created the highest xG this season (that is somehow Manchester United) nor conceded the least xG (that is the miserly Newcastle United) but their xPts across those five games have been calculated as 9.98. They are closely followed by the equally impressive Crystal Palace.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS bosses are ‘notably unhappy’ with the ‘frustration’ over Ruben Amorim’s contentious system and philosophy at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim relieved the pressure through a 2-1 victory over Chelsea last time out but there are still widespread concerns over his 3-4-3 formation at Old Trafford, and ahead of that win it was claimed he was ‘losing the confidence of the dressing room’, with ‘senior players’ questioning his tactics.",
      "Ratcliffe was at Carrington to meet with Amorim ahead of Sunday’s game, with Amorim joking that he was there to offer him a new deal.",
      "“New contract, he was offering me a new contract,” Amorim said in his press conference when asked about Ratcliffe’s visit.",
      "“No, it’s normal things, just to show the support, explaining that it’s a long project. He said many times, ‘This is my third season.’ For me, it’s not. But normal things.",
      "“I spoke with him, with [CEO] Omar [Berrrada], with [director of football] Jason [Wilcox], just trying to see all the data around the team.”",
      "And TBR Football’s chief correspondent Graeme Bailey has revealed more details on that meeting between Ratcliffe and Amorim, claiming United chief is “happy” with the summer transfer window and recognises an improvement in the team.",
      "Bailey said: “They’re happy with what’s happened over the summer – the players brought in, the system he’s implementing — and the main focus is seeing progress on the field.",
      "“And we are already seeing it: they’re a much better team than when he first took over, though admittedly they couldn’t have been much worse.",
      "“The club is backing Amorim. Jason Wilcox has fully bought into his approach, and the squad is being shaped in Amorim’s image. There’s little point in cancelling the experiment now — that would set the club back even further.”",
      "But the report adds that ‘Ratcliffe and his lieutenants are notably unhappy with the number of leaks around players voicing their frustration with Amorim’s system’.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs gave an update on Wednesday, from what he’s heard, on Amorim’s future at Man Utd.",
      "He said: “There is certainly appreciation for names like Oliver Glasner, but the sign that Amorim is still being backed is that there has been no outreach yet. There’s been no shortlisting yet. There hasn’t even, to my knowledge, been any succession planning yet.",
      "“Manchester United still want to try and make it work with Ruben Amorim. That’s why he is likely to get a few more games, at least, before some of these other names perhaps come a bit more seriously to the fore if results don’t go according to plan for Amorim.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already picked out a ‘prime candidate’ to replace under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Eintracht Frankfurt manager Dino Toppmoller has thrown his hat into the ring for any future Man Utd job openings amid pressure on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ruben Amorim “has got a couple of months left” at Man Utd, according to Ben Foster, but one of his likely replacements has a big “worry” hanging over him.",

      "Manchester United are apparently now ‘leading the race for a No.6’ that they should have entered in the summer transfer window and almost certainly won’t win at the end of this season.",
      "The Red Devils opted to spend their cash this summer on an all-new forward line and a backup goalkeeper, with a late push for Carlos Baleba more of a nudge before a weird reported baulk at a £100m price tag slapped on a midfielder who was always going to be valued at that mark by Brighton.",
      "The United performances this season, featuring an inept Manuel Ugarte and a foolhardy Casemiro over wantaway Kobbie Mainoo in the double pivot with Bruno Fernandes have confirmed a need that seemingly everyone but the Manchester United decision-makers viewed as either priority one, two or three over the summer.",
      "‘Manchester United are ready to lead the way next summer in the race for No 6 midfielders with the key position expected to dominate the transfer market,’ The Telegraph claimed on Wednesday, before revealing later in the report precisely why the Red Devils won’t be leading that race.",
      "The lure of Big Club history may have been enough to persuade Bryan Mbeumo to snub Newcastle for Manchester United, but that will surely prove to be no match against modern-day behemoth Manchester City in the transfer stakes next summer.",
      "It’s claimed ‘Manchester City could look at that position to ease the workload of 2024 Ballon d’Or winner Rodri’ in a possibility we can’t imagine Nico Gonzalez will be too fond of as he works to prove himself as a serviceable backup to his Spanish compatriot.",
      "While reports suggest United will reopen talks with Brighton over Baleba, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are also on the Red Devils’ shortlist, but in an increasingly unimaginative transfer market in which top clubs chase the same players, placing particular value on homegrown talents like Anderson or Wharton, we can also assume they’re on City’s.",
      "And we wonder whether Liverpool’s likely push for Wharton as a backup for Ryan Gravenberch, having been linked with the Palace midfielder in the summer amid their apparent bid to provide Arne Slot with two brilliant footballers to choose between in every position, may in fact bring about a situation where United have to settle for current top target Baleba.",
      "As Fabian Hurzeler said at the weekend, Baleba is “not a machine” and there is a “responsibility” for Brighton to help him rediscover his form having had his head turned by United to such a degree that he doesn’t look worth the £23.5m the Seagulls paid for him in the summer of 2023, let alone the nine-figure sum they’re now asking for.",
      "A similar trajectory which saw Evan Ferguson fade into anonymity having been linked with a big-money move to United would presumably lead even the hive-minders at Old Trafford to plump for one of the two alternatives, but interest from City and Liverpool in those same players would surely result in United finishing last in a race they’re currently leading.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Man Utd remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Ben Jacobs says Man Utd-linked midfielder Adam Wharton has a “gentleman’s agreement” with Crystal Palace, meaning he can leave the club next summer.",
      "Man Utd will reportedly push to sign Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba in January, which surely means Kobbie Mainoo is being pushed out.",
      "Manchester United face a nightmare scenario if/when Liverpool hijack their arch-rivals in the race for a ‘dream’ transfer in 2026…",
      "Liverpool have just broken the British transfer record for an ‘£86m player’ but have their own ideas about Carlos Baleba and Michael Olise.",
      "Liverpool are making ‘serious moves’ to land a star Manchester United midfield target in the January transfer window, according to insider Indy Kaila."

      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",

      "Send your mails to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "I understand why F365 thinks that Scholes has a Marcus Rashford problem.",
      "Because if you haven’t put yourself through each and every rubbish match they have played over the last 4-5 years, and then check that Rashford does play a few games a season quite well, you will wonder why Rashford is being targeted. But as someone who really really liked Marcus Rashford, and has put himself through each and every minute of each and every game since 10-15 years now, let me tell you why Scholes is just saying what every fan feels.",
      "Marcus is a local lad, who burst through and gave United fans hope that this is the next Academy player to be a star. He had great talent, was an amazing human and had the right values. So when he walks around the field for 80% of the match, literally not putting 2 steps to the right to try and defend or even fake defend when United don’t have the ball, and is one of the laziest players I’ve seen to grace the pitch, right up there with Martial and the 40 year old Ronaldo playing for Portugal currently. And while the Ronaldo case is easier to understand and the rest of the team work 10% harder to accommodate him at the age of 40, there is absolutely no reason the rest of the United team should suffer because Marcus cannot be bothered to do a proper job.",
      "On the edge of his own box, with the ball in front of him, he will just walk around and let the opposition players take shots or walk past him with ease. In EACH AND EVERY MATCH. It’s extremely annoying to watch regularly.",
      "Twice or thrice a season, he will put in a performance where he is energetic, runs with and without the ball, and his decision making is on point. But the rest of the time, he is one of the most lazy, infuriating and abysmal players on the pitch. Then comes his off-pitch behavior of being late, going partying, not working with the team agenda in mind, when he was the poster boy for Manchester United, it all mixes together to bring a feeling of sadness and regret at what he could have been and what he has become. The massive wages United gave him play a part in this downfall and for that I blame the management and board.",
      "The only reason I am excited for Rashford scoring or playing well for Barca is so United can scam 30 million pounds off for him, which no one in their right minds would otherwise pay along with his stupid wages. May he excel at Barca and find his peace there. I genuinely wish him well, and unlike Scholes I am happy for him if he finds a home in the beautiful city of Barcelona.\nAman",

      "Which demonstrates that the manager sets the required culture (standards), the players have to fall in line and if they don’t the manager needs to be backed by senior leaders to enforce the required standards. This starts with disciplining the players and if they continue to misbehave they need to be removed from the team and the club. This has what has clearly happened at Arsenal.",
      "At Utd both Ten Hag and Amorim have set standards. They started by disciplining players (dropping them/fining them) then moved to excluding them and then selling them. This was clearly backed by senior leadership who allowed multi million pound assets to lose value by excluding them from the first team.",
      "Therefore the managers and senior leadership have done their jobs in maintaining culture and standards.",
      "In conclusion what is left are the players that did not uphold Utd’s standards and culture. And although it could be argued that what they are paid is irrelevant, my argument would be that a) employees earning 25k a year are expected to adhere to company standards b) chief executives earning 10m a year are expected to adhere to company standards. Therefore people earning 15m a year certainly should be.",

      "There was literally zero prospect of a team trying to go through an entire season with just one recognised striker, so two were always going to be necessary. The fact that one of these unexpectedly turned out to be Isak may have pushed Ekitike from an expected starting role to backup, but doesn’t change the fundamental fact that he was always going to be competing with someone for his place. He was likely made aware of this when he signed.",
      "After a great start to his Liverpool career, getting himself sent off in some of the dumbest circumstances possible will have undoubtedly not helped him retain his starting position over Isak, but that has probably only accelerated the inevitable.",
      "However, with the number of games that Liverpool are likely to play and Isak’s lack of pre-season and slightly patchy injury record, Ekitike will still get plenty of starts and substitute appearances. It therefore seems unlikely that the times he spends on the bench will result in significant surprise or unhappiness on his part despite what the media and certain people BTL would have you believe.\nMatt D, London",

Ekitike was born in 2002, so for his entire football playing life, he’s known he’ll be booked if he does that.",
      "As Hesh points out, it’s a “nonsense” rule given how ultimately harmless the act is, and how unaffected the other team are by it.",

He said that when a young player like Baleba is linked to a team like Man Utd and the deal doesn’t happen, this can have an influence on his performance. It can have an impact.",

      "Paul Scholes knows the unique pressures of Manchester United – and the possible ‘mistakes’ – better than anyone. So what’s his Marcus Rashford problem?",
      "It won’t have surprised Marcus Rashford that moving to another country has failed to extract him from the Manchester United orbit, nor perhaps how strong opinions toward him remain.",
      "But it would be interesting to hear his thoughts on Paul Scholes openly and happily explaining how “I really struggle to feel happy for him” after Rashford kickstarted his Barcelona career this past week.",
      "That is a remarkable admission, an insight which reveals far more uncomfortable truths about the personality of the pundit than it does the character of the player.",
      "“Mainly because of his attitude, and his attitude at United by the time he was leaving,” Scholes continued, obviously on a podcast, obviously with Nicky Butt and Paddy McGuiness.",
      "“I thought he was a disgrace at United, and not trying, which look, if you fall out with the manager then okay. But remember, you’ve got teammates you’re playing with, you’ve got a massive 80,000 there, whatever it is every single week that you have to put a bit of effort in for.",
      "“The amount of times I saw him at Man United walking, because he wants to leave…I thought his whole demeanour about him was a disgrace.”",
      "The diatribe went on with shots at his work-rate against Newcastle – in a game he decided with two excellent goals – and culminated in a rant about Rashford being dropped for Barcelona’s next game after turning up late to a pre-match meeting.",
      "“What the f**k? How do you sleep in these days?” an increasingly incredulous Scholes asked, despite it long since having been reported that Rashford had been two minutes late because of a delay in filling out an electronic form, that he didn’t miss any of the pre-match preparations and indeed that he set up the third goal in a win over Valencia from the bench.",
      "A repeat of his past indiscretion under Erik ten Hag this was not.",
      "But that is the sort of fabrication one can only expect from a professional pundit who “really struggles to feel happy for” someone whose sacrifices and shortcomings he really should almost uniquely understand.",
      "Scholes has an important platform and authoritative voice, but also an obligation to use those properly in an arena as highly charged as that of Manchester United. If he cannot relate to and explain the pressures a professional footballer faces at the elite level and the misjudgements that can sometimes force them to make, that reflects abysmally on him rather than Rashford.",
      "The line about how Rashford “actually quit on Manchester United, and once you quit once, you’ll quit again” stood out too, as did the references to his age no longer being a defence of his actions.",
      "And at 27 that is absolutely fair. Rashford should know better than many of the decisions he made towards the ostensible end of his Manchester United career suggested.",
      "He might also justifiably point out he could have “quit on Manchester United” far sooner instead of playing through the pain of back, shoulder and foot injuries to be the most-used player by Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and second for Erik ten Hag.",
      "But a 26-year-old Scholes would have been grateful not to face this constant level of withering censure and scrutiny when he made what has since been described as his biggest career regret.",
      "“I made a mistake,” Scholes has said of a moment his “head had just gone” in November 2001. “I did stupid things when I was a kid, when I was younger,” he added of refusing to play in a League Cup tie against Arsenal 24 hours after only getting 13 minutes from the bench in a defeat to Liverpool.",
      "Except he was no more “a kid” then than Rashford is now, no less responsible for his choices and actions. Scholes was fined two weeks’ wages, much as Rashford was during his infamous Belfast-based indiscretion at precisely the same age around 18 months ago.",
      "The difference is less in the players and far more in the club and its corroded culture. Manchester United in 2001 is the diametric opposite to Manchester United in 2025. The former was defined by the support network and sensational man-management of Sir Alex Ferguson; the latter protects nothing and no-one, exposing all it touches to toxicity and self-destruction.",
      "It is what Scholes and the rest of the “circle of Ferguson” so often overlook or take for granted. Their ludicrous talent aligned perfectly with the reign of a genius manager and elite structure which encouraged individual development and offered an environment in which players were protected. They speak from a position of immense ability and vast experience but also absurd fortune.",
      "Had this infernal brand of omnipresent Manchester United player-turned-pundit arrived a generation or two later, been saddled with hierarchical incompetence and intermittent coaching upheaval throughout their careers and had Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and Bill Foulkes seeking out every microphone ever manufactured to actively undermine and denigrate them at any opportunity, they too might have found it tough and ultimately decided that leaving was in the best interests of all parties.",
      "Rashford did so in the knowledge that bridges had been burned on both sides, not just his. He won’t have expected a pat on the back and a pledge of lifelong support from the fans in doing so, but it also feels entirely ridiculous for one of his presumed heroes to brand him a “disgrace” who he “really struggles to feel happy for” 10 months after his last appearance for a broken club he tried to carry as far as he could.",
      "Spurs are definitely about to sign stars from Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona while keeping Djed Spence and his penitentiary at left-back.",
      "Has the Club World Cup absolutely cocked up Chelsea’s season? It’s starting to feel like that with such a long injury list.",
      "Every Arsenal game currently seems to be wracked with tension, and a trip to Newcastle will be no different on another Big Weekend.",
      "Liverpool will probably manage without their fourth-choice centre-half and there are a fair few reasons why panicking over Eberechi Eze at Arsenal is daft.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Nottingham Forest are absolutely rattling through all the giddy highs and infuriating lows that come with Ange Postecoglou. It is captivating to watch."

      "Harry Kane reportedly has an exit clause in his Bayern Munich contract that could attract the attention of Premier League clubs Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Kane left Tottenham for Bayern ahead of the 2023/24 season and claimed the first trophy of his career in May, lifting the Bundesliga title.",
      "He has scored an extraordinary 98 goals in 103 matches for the German giants and has started this season in terrific form, registering 13 goals and three assists in seven appearances, including a brace against Chelsea in the Champions League last week.",
      "The 32-year-old will hit a century of goals for Bayern in only 104 games with a brace on Friday against Werder Bremen, which would make him the fastest player in Europe’s top-five leagues to reach that milestone. Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland both reached 100 goals in 105 games for Real Madrid and Manchester City, respectively.",
      "READ: Six left-field predictions of players who could win the 2026 Ballon d’Or",
      "Kane has been Bayern’s best and most consistent player since joining for around £100million, and they are reportedly in danger of losing him in the 2026 summer transfer window.",
      "According to German outlet Bild, there is an ‘exit clause in his contract’ worth €65million (£56.8m), though he would have to ‘announce his move in the winter’.",
      "That fee for a 33-year-old represents ‘a lot of money’ but also ‘could be dangerous for Bayern’, the report states.",
      "However, that ‘doesn’t even buy half the price of Alexander Isak’ and even if Kane stays in Germany until he’s 36, ‘a model professional like him would still be tearing the Bundesliga to pieces’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "Kane is said to still be keen to break the Premier League goalscoring record. It’s currently held by Alan Shearer with 260 goals. He himself has 213, all of which he’s scored for Tottenham. Should he return to his homeland in the summer after the 2026 World Cup, at the age of 33, he would have a prime chance of breaking the record.",
      "Former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann recently said Kane has a clause in his contract allowing him to leave next summer and backed Manchester United to sign him.",
      "He Adventure Gamers: “I think Harry Kane has a clause that allows him to leave for a certain amount next summer. I believe the reason Bayern Munich wanted to bring Nick Woltemade in this summer was because many within the club think Kane wants to go back to England after the World Cup.",
      "“I can see Harry Kane at Manchester United next season, and I think he’d do well for them,” Hamann added.",
      "“Having said that, I always felt that as a London boy, sometimes they don’t really like to go to the north. Having played for Spurs, obviously Chelsea and Arsenal might be tricky, but then again, you never know, if they give him a chance to win the Premier League.",
      "“I always felt or thought that a London club would be more favourable than a northern club, but obviously United is probably still the biggest club in England, and if they were to ask for his services, I think it would be fantastic to see him as their number nine.”",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly considering a move for Bayern and England superstar Harry Kane, who can leave the German club for less than £60m next summer.",
      "According to reports, Harry Kane has already reached an ‘agreement’ for his next move amid interest from Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Gary Neville is doing his best to suggest Harry Kane might move to any other Premier League team other than Tottenham. Chelsea, anyone?",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have been ‘handed a dream scenario’ regarding Harry Kane, while they are ‘very close to’ their next signing.",
      "Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank admits that he “would like to see” Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane return to Spurs as soon as possible.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League, sharing his best bets and predictions.",
      "Football loves a storyline and sometimes spotting a potential one can lead to some profitable betting decisions. This fixture has it written all over it. I'm looking straight at the Bryan Mbeumo to score price and getting involved at 2/1 with Sky Bet. It's a selection where football's emotion meets football's logic. A case of the ex.",
      "Football fans have seen it before. A player goes back to his old stomping ground, a place where he was adored, nurtured and given the stage - and what happens? He scores. The emotion of the occasion can lift a player. Add in that little extra point to prove, and suddenly you've got the perfect recipe for a goalscorer bet.",
      "Also, Mbeumo knows Brentford inside-out. He knows the weaknesses, the defensive gaps, the way his opposition full-back will defend. And since joining United, Mbeumo has looked the part too - stretching defences, taking on full-backs, and looking dangerous between the lines. He's averaging a healthy 0.39 expected goals per 90 - a clear sign that chances are falling his way therefore his goal return should see an uptick soon enough.",
      "If you're the kind of punter like me who likes clean sheets, defensive discipline and backing under-goal lines - then this game isn't for you. This clash has got goals written all over it.",
      "Past meetings have at times descended into footballing mayhem. The last six meetings have averaged 4.3 goals per game and who can forget last season's fixture at Stamford Bridge where Brighton's offside trap was exposed brutally by Chelsea and shots were flying in from 30 yards in a 4-2 home win.",
      "Brighton remain the most reliable team in the Premier League for goals. Only one of their last 25 games across all competitions has seen less than two goals scored with the per game total goals average at a fiery 3.64 per game. Expect entertainment and the over 3.5 goal line to give you a great run at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "The lazy narrative will tell you that Liverpool have the title wrapped up already. Results say they're flying - unbeaten in five, late winners. But peel back the scoreboard and ask yourself, are this team that convincing?",
      "For me? No.",
      "This team are getting the job done, yes, but there's a lack of control in games that is leading to fine margins deciding the outcomes. That should ring a few alarm bells. Bournemouth caused them problems. Newcastle ran all over them. Burnley almost stifled them. Everton nearly nabbed them.",
      "Palace can punish them. Oliver Glasner has built a no-nonsense team that are almost perfect in terms of organisation without possession. Since they got beat 5-0 at Newcastle they are unbeaten in 17 competitive games, and they've won two trophies in that time. Across those 17 games they have just conceded nine goals and bagged nine clean sheets. That pure structural discipline can lead them to a result here on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "I think this game sets up very well for a Leeds win here at 2/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a fantastic team to bet on as their style never changes and clear, trustworthy patterns are emerging in that when teams allow them the ball, they struggle.",
      "In their last 14 matches where they've averaged 56 per cent or more possession, their record is W4 D3 L7. In that sample size they have been beaten by Brentford twice, Leicester and Ipswich. If Bournemouth can't force you into transitions, they become awkwardly one-paced and predictable in the final third.",
      "And this is how Leeds have been trying to play this season. They are full of physicality and built to play very direct and aggressive football with also being very secure at the back where the excellent Ethan Ampadu leads their defensive organisation.",
      "This will be a game where punters will be twitching their fingers instinctively towards the overs with visions of City with Erling Haaland in the form of his life carving through a low block like a hot knife through butter. But if you scratch beneath the surface, there's a compelling case for going the other way. The under 2.5 goals angle looks best bet of the weekend material at 7/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Pep Guardiola just might be building a team that dominates through defensive output - and the rock-solid axis of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol is absolutely pivotal to that. They've started 11 games together domestically since the start of April and City won eight of those games with the only defeat being the FA Cup final. Across those 11 games they only conceded five goals, keeping seven clean sheets.",
      "And now if you add Gianluigi Donnarumma and Rodri into that defensive unit, you've got yourself a really domineering and formidable defensive axis, one that could be the backbone of a team that challenges for major honours once again.",
      "Also, of the 50 Premier League games played this season, 25 have fallen under the 2.5 goals line and the overall goals per game average sits at 2.48. That will eventually rise but it's just another bit of evidence to throw in the mix for an unders bet.",
      "Hello, old friend. Nice to see you again. Ange-ball was back and dancing to the tune of some very happy Forest fans in the away end at Real Betis.",
      "Yes, Forest didn't get maximum points but boy were they pulsating for most of that game. Ange Postecoglou has flicked the tactical switch as the new boss and has painted his footballing identity all over these Forest players already which is based around: attack first, ask questions later.",
      "You could see the blueprint Postecoglou built at Celtic and Spurs - overloads in wide areas, full-backs tucking in to build and midfielders darting between lines, something Elliot Anderson absolutely thrived at.",
      "It was fun to watch. And we can declare with confidence that they're going to create chances. Lots of them. And concede lots of chances too.",
      "This new Forest style is going to blow the lid off their goal lines. Forget the side that grinded out 1-0s at home - this is now a team actively embracing risk and one who will become an over 2.5 money-spinner while the prices remain behind the curve. It's Evens here and where Postecoglou is involved, over 2.5 lines simply must be your punting friend.",
      "Vitor Pereira needs to change something. Dating back to last season, Wolves have no win in nine games, taking just one point from the last 27 available. However, he might just have stumbled upon the system that could lead to a change in fortunes. The 4-4-2 he played in the midweek win over Everton made Wolves more compact and - crucially - seemed to help get support into their key striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "This Wolves side might still be winless but playing Spurs, weirdly, brings out their best. They have amassed nine Premier League wins vs Spurs, the club's joint-most against any opponent and have won four of the last five meetings.",
      "Maybe, the old-school 4-4-2 could be the key to spark Wolves into life against their favourite opponent? They could be worth a swing at 4/1 on the draw no bet with Sky Bet.",
      "Sander Berge to be carded at 3/1 with Sky Bet is simply too big for a player who's being thrust into the midfield furnace against one of the most skilled card-drawing teams in the Premier League.",
      "Aston Villa's engine room of Morgan Rogers and John McGinn - with the occasional Ollie Watkins thrown in from further forward - isn't just technically sharp, it's a card magnet's dream. They rotate positions, carry the ball with purpose and are constantly engaging the opposition.",
      "In Villa's last 14 Premier League games an opposition centre-midfielder has been carded in 12 of those matches with 16 carded in total. Fulham have history of cards in this fixture too, having been shown 20 yellows in the past five meetings, with Berge one of those players cautioned last time.",
      "This is the last fixture Mikel Arteta needs right now.",
      "A trip that's rapidly becoming one of the most emotionally charged and physically demanding fixtures in the Premier League calendar and one where Arsenal have history of succumbing to the atmosphere.",
      "Arsenal are favourites with the markets here at Evens with Sky Bet. But should they be? I'm not having it. Not when Newcastle are in this kind of mood at home as the underdog.",
      "There's something about Newcastle that rattles Arteta's Arsenal. The Gunners have lost four of their last five games in all competitions at St James' Park, including both visits last season. They have failed to score in all four defeats.",
      "Arteta teams love rhythm and structure and the Newcastle midfield don't give you that. They break your passing lanes, slow down your build-up and make it a scrap. They don't just play the occasion, they use it as a weapon. And in front of the Geordie faithful, Newcastle look a savvy bet on the draw no bet market at 6/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Since swapping the somewhat clockwork football of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City for the freedom given to him at Everton, Jack Grealish looks like Jack Grealish again.",
      "His take-ons per 90 has rocketed from 3.7 per game at City from the past two seasons to 9.1 per 90 in the Everton blue. Grealish's time at City wasn't wasted of course, he won trophies, created history and matured. But he wasn't the maverick that made him box office.",
      "Well, the maverick inside is being unleashed by David Moyes and Grealish is the most creative player in the Premier League as a result. Grealish has four assists, creating 2.9 chances per 90 from open play - no player to have played 200 minutes or more has a higher per-90 figure from that metric. He is 11/4 with Sky Bet to bag another assist in what should be a routine home win.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",

      "\"We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",

      "All the debate around Bruno Fernandes' position in Ruben Amorim's system after the Manchester derby this week re-opened the conversation around whether Manchester United should have cashed in on their captain over the summer.",
      "The £100m on offer from Saudi Arabia could have been spent re-shaping the midfield, which is so dearly in need of reinforcements. But the message from Amorim was clear: letting Fernandes go at such a pivotal moment in his rebuild would be a terrible decision.",
      "Against Chelsea, Fernandes' value was evident. Not in a tactical sense, but as a leader. In every stage of the game the skipper was pushing his team forward. \"That is the most important thing, the influence he has on the squad,\" Amorim said after the game.",
      "Fernandes showed that he can get into goalscoring positions when playing in a two-man midfield. He grabbed the opening goal, his 100th in United colours, that got the ball rolling against Chelsea. That put everyone at ease and opened the game up.",
      "Amorim is undoubtedly asking a lot of his captain to dictate the game from deep and deliver a threat in the final third, but on Saturday Fernandes rose to the occasion. \"The point of the captain is to be the best he can be in every situation to make the team better,\" added Amorim.",
      "Even when United were wobbling in the closing stages, Fernandes single-handedly led his team up the pitch after dispossessing Reece James and very nearly scored a stunning strike from range before firing up the Stretford End.",
      "Who could Man Utd have signed this summer that would deliver all of this straight away? Many of Amorim's decisions have rightly been questioned but keeping Fernandes was no doubt the right call.Zinny Boswell",
      "Trevoh Chalobah's header briefly gave Chelsea hope at Old Trafford but the one-goal margin of defeat flattered them. Despite Casemiro's red card levelling the playing field before half-time, they only managed five shots worth a meagre 0.39 expected goals.",
      "Their listless performance capped a poor week after drawing with Brentford and losing their Champions League opener to Bayern Munich. It also raised questions of their head coach Enzo Maresca, whose decisions during the game did little to help his side.",
      "First came his call to substitute Pedro Neto as well as Estevao after Robert Sanchez's early red card, leaving Chelsea devoid of any kind of quick outlet. Not long after that, he withdrew Cole Palmer, later explaining he was not fully fit before the game.",
      "Starting a half-fit Palmer only three days after he played 90 minutes in Munich was never likely to end well and his removal, for the more defensively-minded Andrey Santos, further limited his side offensively when they were chasing the game.",
      "Maresca could have called on Alejandro Garnacho, who would surely have been desperate to prove a point against his former side, or the £51.5m Jamie Gittens, but both players finished the game as unused substitutes, with Tyrique George, a player they seemed happy to sell a month ago, preferred in the second half. It was another strange decision from the Chelsea boss in a game full of them.Nick Wright",
      "Graham Potter is a hard man to read. Perhaps he is a better poker player than football manager in that regard.",
      "As he strode into his post-match press conference to address a room of journalists ready to poke and probe him on his West Ham future, you would not have been able to tell if his team had won 6-0 or lost 2-1. His emotionless responses were as predictable as the West Ham defeat.",
      "Remember, football is supposed to be an emotional game, played by emotional people, managed in the most emotionally volatile environments. And that is where Potter keeps falling short.",
      "There is no doubting his coaching credentials. His work at Ostersunds, Brighton and even in patches at Chelsea paints the picture of a tactician who understands the game at a deep level and he is well admired within coaching circles.",
      "His problem is that lack of personality. It is going to hold him back from ever making a success of himself at a big club. It is unlikely now he will get that chance again as his stock continues to fall.Lewis Jones",
      "Last season, this Spurs side embarrassingly collapsed at Brighton, but nearly a year on, they showed real fight to rescue a draw as they appear far more resilient under Thomas Frank.",
      "Having gone 2-0 down after 31 minutes on Saturday, Spurs looked set to suffer their first away defeat under the Dane, but there is a steeliness about this Tottenham side that was not always evident under Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Last October, Spurs went 2-0 up after 37 minutes, but a shocking second-half surrender saw Brighton win 3-2 with Postecoglou labelling it then as his \"worst defeat\" of his tenure.",
      "For Frank, the same venue has provided the opposite feeling as he called the 2-2 draw their \"best performance of the season\".",
      "He had a point with Spurs looking far more threatening than in their midweek Champions League home win over Villarreal.",
      "Frank was also delighted with their \"mentality\" and \"physicality\" in their comeback over Brighton - something they are going to need plenty of with a potential 50-plus game season in store.",
      "Eyebrows were slightly raised when £51m signing Xavi Simons started on the bench, but he came on to great effect in the No 10 role, where surely he will have a much better impact than out on the left-wing.",
      "Another bright spot was left-back Destiny Udogie, whom Frank hailed \"exceptional\" and \"unstoppable\" on his first start of the season.",
      "Udogie was a part of that Spurs side which crumbled on the south coast last season, but in this rescue act he was one to display Frank's pursuit of a tougher and determined Spurs.Declan Olley",
      "After such a dour Fulham performance against Leeds last weekend, it was curious that Marco Silva chose not to pick any of the substitutes - let's be honest, Kevin, who spurred them to victory late on in that game - to start against Brentford.",
      "Maybe that is why he is the Premier League head coach, because after a week of seeing his side on the training ground he was absolutely right to keep faith that they would find their energy and creativity again.",
      "He said this week their ambitions would not be dimmed by a difficult transfer window, with only Aston Villa spending less, but resources do make a difference.",
      "This was a timely reminder of the talent that remains at Craven Cottage, and that was without their tricky new Brazilian, or fellow new arrival Samuel Chukwueze who was an unused substitute.",
      "Special credit to Josh King, who was unusually quiet in his last game and gave away Brentford's opener in this one, but went on to drive the hosts forward before he was withdrawn.",
      "Silva said he was \"impressed, but not surprised\" by the 18-year-old's maturity, and the way he refused to hide despite such an unfortunate error was a credit to the teenager.",
      "Little surprise he was handed a standing ovation when he eventually made way for the Brazilian. It almost warrants a double take that this was just his 20th senior appearance.Ron Walker",
      "Wolves have always been slow starters. They have lost nine out of their last 10 matches and they have conceded a double-digit goal tally in each of the last three seasons. But this feels different - and not in a good way.",
      "Wolves look sloppy at both ends of the pitch. Only West Ham have conceded more goals than them while they have a Premier League-high of errors leading to goals this season.",
      "Meanwhile, their attacking credentials were summed up on Saturday by having three times more of expected goals than Leeds, who in turn managed three times more actual goals than them.",
      "Losing Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Pablo Sarabia and Matheus Cunha in one summer would cause that. Wolves are not just missing the quality the quartet bring, but also the experience of these situations.",
      "Wolves also appear to have tied their own hands in tying Vitor Pereira down to a new deal this week. It makes a change of direction much harder, as pulling the plug on Pereira would then create further questions about the club's decision makers.",
      "So Wolves are not just slow starters, they are stuck and standing still.Sam Blitz",
      "Three summer signings got on the scoresheet for Leeds at Wolves and all stole the show in their different ways.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin's first Premier League goal since January was a throwback to his best self - not only grabbing Leeds' equaliser but leading the line with solid build-up play.",
      "Anton Stach's brilliant free-kick was the moment of the match. The German midfielder came into the weekend as the only Premier League player with at least 10 shots and 10 chances created - and he will join Calvert-Lewin in producing attacking creativity to make Daniel Farke's side dangerous.",
      "But the standout player was Noah Okafor, whose third goal was so well deserved after an industrious performance down the left.",
      "The winger attempted an incredible 14 dribbles - 12 of them coming before half-time. That dozen was already the most out of any Premier League player in a single match all season, and his aggressive and clinical display epitomised their overall display.",
      "A lot of Leeds' summer signings had one thing in common: six foot or above. Farke even admitted they had been brought in with physicality and even set-pieces in mind.",
      "But Leeds have showed something different: they have actual Premier League quality capable of keeping them up.Sam Blitz",
      "Ange Postecoglou says Nottingham Forest are \"responding\" to what he wants them to do, despite his side being winless since he replaced Nuno Espirito Santo.",
      "The worrying thing for him is that Forest are beginning to inherit some good things from Postcoglou but they are also taking on his downsides.",
      "Postecoglou is winless in his last nine Premier League games and that stretches back into the latter days at Tottenham. It is his longest run without a league win as a top-flight manager across spells in Australia, Japan, Scotland and England.",
      "Forest started strongly and quickly, which earned them a much-deserved second-minute opener. The intensity was there. But the almost kamikaze nature of their play allowed Burnley back into the game, ceding control with Scott Parker's side looking the more likely. Burnley's equaliser in the 20th minute was a deserved one, and their display from that point merited at least one more with the chances they created.",
      "It is those periods that Postecoglou failed to manage during his Spurs days and similar patterns are emerging. Postecoglou needs to buck that trend if he is to find any success at the City Ground.William Bitibiri",
      "In a Premier League where we obsess with big names, big budgets and big personalities, Oliver Glasner is crafting something special - something clever - at Crystal Palace.",
      "He is one that embraces the marginal gains. If there is one manager in the Premier League who embodies that philosophy to the letter, it is Glasner.",
      "The win at West Ham was the perfect case in point where Palace exposed West Ham's fragilities at set-pieces. Glasner's team scored one and created two other big chances from such scenarios and he was very open in his post-match presser about how he knew he could expose a psychological weakness in the West Ham ranks.",
      "He said: \"I played over 19 years as a defender and you have periods sometimes where you can concede many set-piece goals. This makes you nervous. It's natural, we're all human beings and even if you don't want it to be there, this just happens. We talked about it. It was good to have many set-plays.\"",
      "Glasner is such a smart cookie.Lewis Jones",

      "Match report and free match highlights as Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro's first-half goals were enough to see Man Utd past Chelsea; Casemiro's second yellow levelled the playing field after early sending off for Robert Sanchez and set up nervy ending after Trevoh Chalobah pulled a goal back",
      "Sunday 21 September 2025 07:20, UK",
      "Manchester United eased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim as they held on to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a frantic encounter which saw both sides down to 10 men.",
      "United made a blistering start and caught Chelsea cold in the pouring Old Trafford rain as Robert Sanchez was sent off after five minutes for chopping down Bryan Mbeumo. Goals from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro then put United firmly in control heading into the break.",
      "However, Casemiro had levelled the playing field when he was shown a second yellow for bringing down Andrey Santos in first-half stoppage-time. Chelsea pulled a late goal back through Trevoh Chalobah but failed to truly take advantage of the opening to extend their nearly 13-year winless run at Old Trafford.",
      "United threatened to collapse but pulled through to secure Amorim's first back-to-back Premier League home wins since taking charge. The second-half performance was unconvincing, but the three points will create some breathing space for now.",
      "Man Utd:  Bayindir (6); De Ligt (7), Maguire (7), Shaw (7); Mazraoui (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7); Mbeumo (8), Sesko (6), Amad (7).\n\n\nSubs:  Ugarte (6), Cunha (6), Mount (6) Yoro (6), Mainoo (N/A).\n\n\nChelsea:  Sanchez (1); James (5), Fofana (4), Chalobah (6), Cucurella (5); Fernandez (5), Caicedo (6), Palmer (4); Neto (4), Joao Pedro (6), Estevao (4).\n\n\nSubs:  Jorgensen (6), Tosin (5), Andrey Santos (6), Gusto (5), George (5). \n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Bruno Fernandes (Man Utd).",
      "Amorim asked for more aggression this week and his players responded emphatically as they overawed Chelsea in the first half. Sanchez's red was the earliest Chelsea had ever had a player sent off and it told. They were shellshocked.",
      "It was the captain Fernandes who eventually got the ball rolling for United with his 100th goal for the club in his 200th Premier League appearance.",
      "After all the debate around Fernandes' position in Amorim's system and whether it gives him enough license to get forward, the midfielder poked in a poacher's finish to open the scoring after Patrick Dorgu's header across goal.",
      "Chelsea were all at sea by then and Enzo Maresca took evasive action to try and prevent the slide after Sanchez's red card, making three substitutions with just 21 minutes on the clock, the earliest a manager has ever done so in the Premier League.",
      "Cole Palmer was a surprise sacrifice for Chelsea, but it later became apparent that the groin issue he had supposedly shaken off after defeat at Bayern Munich on Wednesday in the Champions League was still bothering him.",
      "Casemiro doubled United's lead toward the end of the half thanks to a botched clearance from Reece James that allowed Luke Shaw to overpower Wesley Fofana and head the ball to the back post for the Brazilian to nod in.",
      "His inexplicable decision to pull down Andrey Santos less than 10 minutes later opened the door for Chelsea. Casemiro shook his head after being shown red, as if he had been hard done by, but he should never have given Peter Bankes a decision to make with the game all but won.",
      "Chelsea did not register a single shot on target until Chalobah headed in at the back post from James' cross with 10 minutes to go. United had gone into their shells, fearing a late comeback, but there was not enough conviction from the visitors to capitalise on the wobble.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did not get the Old Trafford return he would have hoped for as he was booed by the home fans and denied the opportunity to enter the fray by a late injury to Fofana which used up Chelsea's final substitution.",
      "Maresca's side return to west London after a sobering week: a draw at Brentford followed by defeats in Munich and Manchester. Chelsea are just one point ahead of United in the table after five games.",
      "\"Every three points is massive in this moment because we haven't started the season as we wanted. But we go game by game. Today was massive and the next one will be massive too.",
      "\"Every goal is important. It doesn't matter the moment. A big moment for me, reaching that milestone for a massive club. I'm very happy, I won't hide from that, but it wasn't something I was trying to achieve when I came to the club. It was about trying to do the best I could and obviously if I can get more goals to help the team win games, that is what matters the most.",
      "\"We were more sit back, try not to concede goals, not let them play through the lines as they have a lot of players who like to drop to play. It was about pushing them to the sides to cross the ball, as we had big players. We still conceded the goal from the corner, but we defended very well. We got the result we wanted in the end.\"",
      "\"This is Amorim's biggest result as Manchester United manager, certainly at home. This was huge for him today. It got edgy once Casemiro got sent off, you weren't sure they were going to be able to see it out.",
      "\"But Bruno Fernandes was magnificent, second half especially. He carried the fight. It feels like a big occasion but they've got to build on it. They've got to go and win two, three, four games.",
      "\"It was a mad game, I have to be honest. Some of the substitutions, some of the tactical changes. It was hard to keep up with at times. But it was a joy because it was so chaotic.\"",
      "\"Really good. Now it's time to create a bit of momentum. We started the game really well, really aggressive. I cannot remember a very good play from us, but we pushed our opponent in how aggressive we were in the first and second balls. We cannot have someone sent off near half-time in Casemiro, we like to complicate all our games! But it was a good game.",
      "\"I felt the urgency, especially in the beginning of the game. The sending off helped us. If you remember the first half, we had so many opportunities three against one, three against two. We have to be more clinical to finish the game sooner. With the sending off of Casemiro, you never know what is going to happen so we have to take the chance to kill the game.\"",
      "\"Very difficult because after three or four minutes with the red card, it completely changed the game. All the plan is in the bin. So it was very complicated.",
      "\"[Sanchez's red card is] a situation that we can avoid because we knew these kind of long balls for Benjamin Sesko, they try to flick for Mbeumo. We knew that. Unfortunately we conceded that moment. When you are one player down, it becomes completely difficult and changed the game.\"",
      "Explaining his decision to make three changes after the red card, Maresca added: \"They are used to attacking with five players, so in that moment we have to defend with five players. We can defend absolutely with four when we are 11 vs 11, but when we are one player down, the idea was to defend with five.",
      "\"We decided to change with Estevao and Pedro Neto and the after we changed Cole because he made an effort to play this game because he was not 100 per cent fit. This morning he had a test and he was OK but not 100 per cent fit. So we decided to change him after 20 minutes.\"",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves as players. It wasn't good enough for ourselves, for the club. The first 15 minutes is the worst we've played this season. We have to reflect on that as a team and learn from this.",
      "\"With the red card that happens, you go 2-0 down in the game, any team you play against, it's always difficult coming back. We struggled in the first half.",
      "\"It's always difficult going down to 10 men and you can see that United were up for it. They put us under pressure. It wasn't good enough at our end. We couldn't get going in the first half.",
      "\"Things like this happen in the season. We can't say we're kids anymore, we've played in the Premier League long enough now. We have just got to learn from this and move forward.",
