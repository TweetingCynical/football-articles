      "Manchester United could shell out millions this summer as they look to get some of their unwanted stars off their books. The likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony are looking for ways out of Old Trafford - but the Red Devils could end up paying to offload them.",
      "Alongside Rashford and Antony, Jadon Sancho was also loaned out last term but the trio are now back in Manchester. They all fell down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim and he's offered no indication that he wants to bring them back into the fold.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho was left out of the starting XI to play in the Europa League final and has since angered club bosses by wearing an Aston Villa shirt with Rashford's name whilst on holiday.",
      "But potential buyers - or loan destinations - know that United want to get the players off their books and are ready to exploit that situation, reports the Telegraph.",
      "Garnacho, Rashford and Antony have contracts until 2028 - with United now expected to subsidise wages even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. Jadon Sancho will again be allowed to leave after loans in the last two seasons.",
      "United will look to negotiate “salary recovery” from loan deals for their players, but the clubs eyeing their individuals believe their bargaining power has been massively dented by the fact they clearly want those players off their books.",
      "Rashford wasn't included in matchday squads in the weeks leading up to his Villa loan last season. He saw his performances increase at Villa Park and he's made it clear that he wants to move to Barcelona, but their priority appears to be signing Nico Williams.",
      "Antony produced his best football for years when he moved to Real Betis, helping them reach the Europa Conference League final. He won individual accolades and the Spanish side are keen on having him on a permanent basis. Last term they paid 84 percent of his salary.",
      "Garnacho has been told he can find a new home - and then proceeded to put up a picture on social media of him in a rival shirt. Chelsea were previously linked with his services as were Napoli.",
      "Manchester bosses have continued to sign players on big wages over the past decade, which has backed them into a corner when it comes to offloading those who failed to deliver.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Two Manchester United players have given their seal of approval to the signing of Bryan Mbeumo, as the Red Devils continue to thrash out a deal with Brentford. United have already had two bids rejected for Mbeumo, the most recent of which totalled £62.5million.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side were prepared to pay Brentford a guaranteed £55m plus £7.5m in potential add-ons for the winger, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season. United side had already seen an offer of £45m plus up to £10m in add-ons turned down earlier this month.",
      "It's been reported that Brentford would want at least £62.5m up front before approving his sale. That's the same fee amount which United paid to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves at the start of window, triggering his release clause.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, also has interest from Tottenham but he only wants to join United. The Red Devils are hopeful that a deal can be agreed in time for the Cameroon international to link up with Amorim's squad at the beginning of pre-season.",
      "United will embark on a tour of the USA this summer and want Mbeumo to be involved so that he can acclimatise himself to his new team-mates. Two members of the Red Devils' dressing room will seemingly be more than happy to welcome him.",
      "On Instagram, both Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee liked a post from journliast Fabrizio Romano which said that United will continue talks over signing Mbeumo. Cunha and Zirkzee could be the men playing alongside the 25-year-old in Amorim's front three next season.",
      "But there's still a way to go yet, with Mbeumo still firmly a Brentford player and due back there for pre-season training. The French-born star has 12 months left on his contract, although the Bees can exercise an option to extend it by a further year.",
      "Mbeumo's prolific form last term piqued the interest of Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham but his heart is set on a move to Old Trafford. Tottenham recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new manager and it was hoped that his connection to Mbeumo would help persuade him to snub United.",
      "Ironically, Frank talked up Mbeumo's price tag at the end of the season. Before joining Tottenham, he was quoted as telling Tipsbladet: \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

      "After heading out of the Stamford Bridge exit this summer, Jadon Sancho has already shown his love for the man likely to replace him at Chelsea. And he would know a thing or two about Jamie Gittens, having previously played in the same Borussia Dortmund line-up.",
      "Sancho, 25, spent this season on loan in west London but failed to make enough of an impact to convince the Blues to sign him permanently. In fact, Chelsea paid parent club Manchester United £5million to circumvent his purchase clause in the hopes they could make better use of their funds.",
      "And it appears Dortmund winger Gittens is the preferred option as he homes in on a return to Cobham this summer. Niko Kovac insisted his attacker only missed his side's Club World Cup win over Ulsan because of illness, but it's been suggested the omission was actually due to the fact that Gittens is on the verge of leaving. The Sun claim Chelsea are now on the verge of signing the winger in a £55.5m deal.",
      "Sancho previously impressed at the Westfalenstadion before returning to the club on a short-term loan last year. He struck up a bond with Gittens during that spell and reached out to his fellow Englishman last winter when the 20-year-old really started to take off as a first-team talent.",
      "\"He [Sancho] wrote to me to say, 'Keep it up,'\" Gittens told the Dortmund website in December. \"'It's your time to show everyone what you can do.' He is a top player and also a top friend.\"",
      "Sancho also complimented Gittens in public last season after the youngster scored twice in a Champions League win over Club Brugge. The United winger commented on one of Gittens' Instagram posts by calling him a \"balla [baller]\" as a show of support for his work.",
      "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has already confessed that the club will sign a new winger this summer after Mykhailo Mudryk missed more than half of this season. The Ukrainian tested positive for a banned substance and is facing a potential four-year ban as a result.",
      "Add Sancho's departure into the equation, and Chelsea's need for reinforcements out wide becomes even more dire. Brazilian winger Estevao is due to arrive in England after completing his transfer from Palmeiras, but the 18-year-old will require some easing into his Premier League surroundings.",
      "Gittens and Sancho spent just six months together as team-mates in Germany, but it's evident the latter made an impact in that time. And former Chelsea academy prospect Gittens admitted as much at the conclusion of a breakthrough 2023/24 campaign.",
      "\"I've learned a lot from Jadon,\" he told German outlet WAZ in July 2024. \"For example, that I have to play with one or two touches more often, that I have to offer deeper runs more often. And when he plays, he enjoys himself; I've learned that too. Jadon is a friend.\"",
      "Gittens spent a brief period of time training with Chelsea's academy as a youngster but never went full-time in their ranks. And it just so happens he made his Champions League debut in a 1-0 win over the Premier League giants in February 2023.",
      "After scoring 12 goals in 49 appearances for Dortmund last season (both career highs), Gittens appears to have done enough to earn Chelsea's interest once again. And it seems as though Sancho is among his advocates as he prepares for a summer homecoming."

      "Manchester United have reportedly given up in their pursuit of Antoine Semenyo - who was once dubbed a “younger version” of Mohamed Salah - after refusing to meet Bournemouth’s asking price.",
      "Having already wrapped up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha to kickstart their summer transfer activity, United are in the market for a more multi-functional forward. Fitting that description is Semenyo, though the move now appears to have crumbled.",
      "The Ghanaian winger’s impressive 13 goals and seven assists this season sparked United’s interest, with talkSPORT claiming the player held talks with the club over a potential Old Trafford move. But the same performances that caught United’s attention have prompted Bournemouth to set the 25-year-old’s transfer value at a whopping £70m.",
      "That figure is part of a wider trend seen this summer, where Premier League clubs are charging more for their players as the traditional big clubs shift their attention to signing players with experience in England’s top flight.",
      "The i Paper reports that, in addition to United, Spurs showed the most interest in Semenyo, having stayed in contact with the Cherries after making an initial enquiry last week. But there’s an increasing belief he will stay at Bournemouth, with the Red Devils, Spurs and Newcastle all unwilling to meet their hefty asking price after he agreed a five-year contract extension with the club last year.",
      "United’s reluctance to pay so much is a clear indication of their approach to the summer transfer window, where they are under financial constraints and will not splurge as recklessly as they have done in the past.",
      "For example, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo has emerged as Ruben Amorim’s top target over Semenyo, but the Red Devils only want him for a reasonable fee. Despite the Cameroonian's desire to join the Red Devils, United are yet to agree a deal with Brentford, who rejected a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in bonuses for the 25-year-old.",
      "The Bees want at least the same fee United paid Wolves for Cunha up-front and it is still unclear whether the Red Devils will pay it. After missing out on European football next season, Amorim’s transfer budget this summer is not as big as it might have been if he had won the Europa League final in May.",
      "However, United’s latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 revealed a more encouraging picture despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this year suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by Christmas.",
      "It’s understood that United will therefore look to complete the signing of Mbeumo to go alongside Cunha with their current finances. But they will need to sell the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony before making any further additions beyond Mbeumo.",
      "If United bank the fees they are looking for for the aforementioned players, they will secure somewhere in the region of £170m. It is not expected that Amorim will sign a third forward, with those funds set to be invested in other areas of the pitch.",
      "That will mean missing out on Semenyo, who, former United striker Michael Owen, encouraged Liverpool to buy back in March as a replacement for Salah, whose future at the time was still unclear.",
      "Owen claimed the versatile winger could be a suitable heir to the Egyptian at Anfield, saying: “I like Antoine Semenyo at Bournemouth, who plays in the same position as Salah. I like him, a younger version, but definitely got energy, scoring capabilities and a good player.”",
      "He added: “That being said, you can’t replace Mo Salah. I mean if you said Mo Salah and Darwin Nunez went and Alexander Isak and Antoine Semenyo came then I don’t think it’s the worst swap in the world if we’re playing fantasy football here, but realistically Liverpool want to keep hold of their best players and Mo Salah is their best player so hopefully he doesn’t leave.\" Semenyo now looks set to stay at Bournemouth unless the club drop their valuation or the player tries to force a move through.",

      "Manchester United may have to start thinking outside of the box when it comes to their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo. The Red Devils were determined to make the Brentford star their second major acquisition of the summer.",
      "Following the signing of Matheus Cunha, they saw the Cameroonian as the perfect signing for their right-flank. The only issue is that Brentford have so far refused to play ball.",
      "The Bees have rejected two bids from United already, the latest being worth around £55m plus £7.5m. That was an increase on the £45m plus up to £10m in add-ons offer that they had already lodged.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was determined to have Mbeumo signed and sealed before pre-season but as it stands, that looks unlikely. Should he want to have a winger under his belt before that deadline, he could be forced to look elsewhere.",
      "While Mbeumo caught the eye for Brentford last season, the same could certainly be said of his teammate Wissa. The Congolese forward netted 20 goals for the Bees in all competitions last season.",
      "And while he played more regularly as an out-and-out striker, Wissa has shown his versatility throughout his career. He has been stationed on either flank, as well as centrally.",
      "Given their stance on Mbeumo, United might find Brentford to be tricky customers once more when it comes to their other star forward, but he should certainly be in their thinking.",
      "Another standout performer in the Premier League last term, Semenyo netted 11 goals for an eye-catching Bournemouth side, as well as notching six assists. And that understandably saw a number of clubs sit up and take notice, with United, Spurs and Newcastle all thought to be admirers.",
      "Like Wissa, Semenyo’s versatility could see him rocket to the top of the list for United, with the Ghanaian equally adept on either flank. But Bournemouth’s stance might make a move slightly difficult.",
      "Semenyo is under contract until 2029, while the Cherries want to bank around £70m should they cash in this summer.",
      "While Wissa and Semenyo enjoyed stunning seasons, it could be argued that Crystal Palace star Eze had the best of the bunch. He scored 14 in all competitions - one of those strikes winning the Eagles the FA Cup - and notched a further 11 assists.",
      "Of course, he is more of an attacking midfielder but he has the skillset to make a very effective winger for United. And Palace might have a decision to make very soon.",
      "Eze has two years left on his contract at Selhurst Park, meaning they’re running out of time to potentially cash in on him. United look set to face competition from Arsenal should they pursue Eze.",
      "A somewhat more realistic option now, Chelsea appear happy to sell Nkunku this summer following a difficult couple of campaigns at Stamford Bridge. He has scored just 17 goals over the past two seasons as a Chelsea player since a big-money move from RB Leipzig.",
      "Again, his versatility might see him emerge as a sensible option given he can play across the frontline. United are long-term admirers of the forward so could renew their interest should the option arise.",
      "Okay, we’re kind of cheating here but desperate times call for desperate measures. There’s no getting around it, Sancho has endured a rotten spell at Old Trafford.",
      "And the Red Devils are desperate to move him on. But should they want to save their money for a out-and-out centre forward, it might not be the worst idea in the world reintegrating Sancho into the side.",
      "There is talent there, as evidenced by his time with Borussia Dortmund - it’s just about getting it out of him.",

      "They finished 15th in the Premier League and missed out on Champions League football after a defeat in the Europa League final in May. However, a glimmer of hope emerged from their misery. It was clearly evident that a rebuild - built in Amorim's vision - was needed for their Portuguese boss to stand a chance at success next season.",
      "United kicked off the transfer window by announcing the signing of Wolves striker Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal earlier this month. The club's hierarchy continues to operate behind the scenes to orchestrate more signings and sales, with several high-profile names linked with an Old Trafford move this summer.",
      "It's clear that Garnacho's days at Old Trafford are numbered. The 20-year-old voiced his dissatisfaction towards Amorim following United's Europa League loss to Spurs in Bilbao, having only been brought on from the 71st minute during the final.",
      "It was just the latest in a series of behavioural issues involving the Argentine winger, with Chelsea and Napoli’s interest providing the perfect chance to sell him this summer. Garnacho's own preference is to remain in the Premier League, which initially made Chelsea the front-runners for his signature.",
      "However, it seems that the Blues have now swapped their Garnacho interest in favour of another winger, Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, who they are reportedly nearing a deal for a fee of £55.5m. Gittens' move to Stamford Bridge would likely put an end to their pursuit of Garnacho.",
      "That leaves United searching for another buyer for a player whose sale would generate substantial funds for new players. Chelsea could send £35m-rated Josh Acheampong to Dortmund in return in a separate deal, with The Independent claiming the Bundesliga side are interested in signing him.",
      "Amorim is clearly a fan of Gyokeres, having played a crucial role in the striker's evolution into a world-class player during their time together at Sporting CP. However, until now, the Swede has insisted that he only wants a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal this summer, as the Gunners weigh up whether to purchase him or RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko is thought to be Mikel Arteta's preferred signing, but Gyokeres was still very much in contention due to his lower price tag. Yet, according to Bild, Leipzig have now reduced their initial asking price of £68-£85m to around £59.7m, which could see Arsenal proceed with their deal for Sesko.",
      "This could put Gyokeres in an unwanted position as his agent has already fallen out with Sporting's bosses by trying to orchestrate a move away. The development, however, provides the perfect opportunity for United to swoop in, should Gyokeres prefer a Premier League move to other options in Europe, with Juventus and other teams also lurking.",
      "On Friday, The Athletic reported that United target Mbeumo has told Brentford he would prefer to sign for the Red Devils if he moves on this summer. Mbeumo's current contract runs until June 2026, though the Bees have the option to extend it by another 12 months.",
      "Despite this, United have made two offers, the second being £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses, both of which were turned down. Negotiations have been ongoing between the two clubs, but a potential deal was being threatened by Tottenham, who recently appointed Mbeumo’s former Brentford boss, Thomas Frank, as head coach.",
      "However, it is understood that the Cameroon international only has eyes for United, with Spurs' interest now thought to be waning. With the player's position clear, it's up to United and Brentford to agree on a transfer that would significantly bolster Amorim's squad next season.",

      "He very publicly fell out with Ruben Amorim last season and while he returned to the side, it did not appear as though he ever fully regained the trust of his manager. Garnacho, 20, was left out of the side for the Europa League final and hinted that he could look elsewhere.",
      "Things have grown even more messy since then, with Chelsea and Napoli expressing interest in signing him. Garnacho was then spotted in an Aston Villa shirt during his post-season break.",
      "In giving his assessment of United’s potential move for Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, Littler claimed that the writing is already on the wall for Garnacho. Speaking to Covers, he said: \"I'm pretty sure we were looking into him last season or the season before, before he joined Chelsea.",
      "“Obviously that's what they're looking into, a swap deal with Garnacho moving to Chelsea and Nkunku to us. But I think either way, Garnacho doesn't have a United future anymore. I think Nkunku can either play as a 10 or play as a 9.\"",
      "Garnacho has been with United since a 2020 move from Spanish side Atletico Madrid and has gone on to make 144 appearances, scoring 26 goals. His current deal is set to run until the summer of 2028.",
      "Regardless of if he stays with the club, Garnacho appears likely to fall down the pecking order. United have already moved for Matheus Cunha and continue to pursue Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo despite the Bees having rejected their second bid.",
      "But Littler is sure that deal will be done and has now urged club chiefs to look at bolstering other parts of the squad next. He added: \"Yeah, obviously we wouldn't be offering more money if we didn't think he's going to fit in well. I think we're up to £60million, £65m as of today. But I'm sure we'll get him over the line.",
      "\"Obviously Matheus Cunha is a done deal from Wolves. But then even if we do get (Mbuemo) we'll need to start looking at the midfield and then obviously the back line.\"",

      "Manchester United are hopeful of agreeing a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo in time for him to start pre-season with them. United submitted a second bid for Mbeumo, understood to be £55million, with the delay in concluding the deal down to agreeing the add-ons involved.",
      "Brentford are said to want the total deal to potentially reach as much as £63m, more than the £62.5m United paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Mbeumo wants to make the move to United, despite his former Brentford boss Thomas Frank being keen on reuniting with him at his new club Tottenham.",
      "Personal terms between United and Mbeumo are understood to have been agreed, with the 25-year-old set to earn around £200,000-a-week. United return for pre-season training on July 7 and boss Ruben Amorim wants Mbeumo on board to start then, along with Cunha, to give them sufficient time to integrate into their new squad.",
      "Mbeumo, who joined Brentford for £5.8m from French side Troyes in 2019, scored 20 goals and provided eight assists last season to help the Bees finish 10th in the Premier League - five places above United.",
      "Having signed Cunha, United identified winger Mbeumo as their next summer signing, with Amorim and the club looking to offload current wide men Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "United are also looking to sign a striker to lead their attack, but failed in their pursuit of Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich, while Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres prefers a move to Arsenal, where he can continue to play in the Champions League.",
      "For only the second time in 35 years, United will not play European football next season, after losing the Europa League final to Spurs, who will compete in the Champions League under Frank. It was Frank who urged Brentford to demand a sizeable fee for the French-born Cameroon international after his stellar season for the Bees.",
      "As quoted by Tipsbladet before joining Tottenham, the former Brentford manager said: \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

      "Paul Ince believes that Manchester United should look to sign Ollie Watkins this summer. The Red Devils have been working hard to improve Ruben Amorim's squad since the opening of the transfer window, securing Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million move earlier this month.",
      "Recruiting proven firepower is thought to be a priority at Old Trafford in the coming months, given that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to have much of an impact in the Premier League in 2024/25 - scoring a combined seven goals.",
      "And as a result, United have been endless in their pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while also showing an interest in the likes of Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres. An initial bid of £55m for Mbeumo was rejected, but it is thought that their improved figure exceeding £60m may get a deal over the line for the 25-year-old winger.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, has also proved to be a tough acquisition for Amorim and the United board. While Arsenal are thought to have held pole position for the 27-year-old striker, who found the back of the net 39 times in the Primeira Liga this season, it appears as though the Red Devils are now back in the running - although a move could cost another £60m.",
      "Newcastle United talisman Alexander Isak is another of the summer transfer window's most talked-about names having impressed at St. James' Park since arriving from Real Sociedad back in 2022. However, the £150m price tag set on the 25-year-old - given that he is considered one of the best goal-scorers in Europe at present and is under contract with the Magpies until 2028 - may prove off-putting to a cost-cutting United side.",
      "With those players totalling as much as £270m, Ince, who played at Old Trafford between 1989 and 1995, believes that his old club could find a far cheaper solution in Aston Villa's Watkins this summer.",
      "\"He can run it behind, he's quick, he can hold the ball up. He's got all the attributes of a striker that you want. And if you look at the way he was kind of pushed out towards the back end of the season when [Marcus] Rashford came, there might be something.",
      "\"He won't be happy about not playing towards the back end of the season. So, there might be something doing. Maybe not, that's down to Ollie and his agent and getting it sorted out. But if I was trying to bring a striker in, I'd bring in Ollie Watkins.",
      "\"And I think it would take a lot of weight off Hojlund. Rasmus Hojlund is a young striker and he's been asked all last season to play at the biggest club under the biggest expectations, under the biggest pressure and the biggest spotlight to score goals.",
      "\"And, you know, it's not happened for him and he's been criticised for it - and I think sometimes a bit unfairly. I think he's one of those young players who maybe needs to maybe go on loan somewhere for a year, score goals or just be a support act for whoever they bring in so he's not under pressure every time when he starts a game.",
      "\"And that coincides with United being poor, United not playing well, players not adjusting to the system. It's been a tough, tough year for him but he’ll learn. It's character-building.",
      "\"But he needs that striker where he can just say, ‘Right, well, the pressure’s not on me to go and score a week in and a week out, and when the game opens up, maybe I can get 15, 20 minutes on the pitch where I can - hit the back of the net.'",
      "\"But it wasn't just the goals and people just talk about the goals. I think, you know, he's got to work on his hold-up play. For me, he needs to be a lot, lot better at his retention of the ball. But these are all things you expect from a young player, but things that he needs to be working on every day.\"",
      "It comes after Arsenal made a bid for Watkins in the January transfer window to the tune of around £60m, which left Villa officials fuming given it was made public just two hours before their Champions League clash with Celtic. Watkins impressed in the Premier League this season, finding the back of the net on 16 occasions in 38 appearances while providing eight goals overall - and should United be serious in bolstering their lead line ahead of 2025/26, the 29-year-old would undoubtedly fit the bill.",
      "Paul Ince spoke ahead of the final #RifeDontMiss Challenge, celebrating the launch of the new RIFE Black Edition putters. To register for the final qualifier and be in with a chance of winning £50,000, sign up here.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "Wayne Rooney is reportedly being eyed for a sensational return to management by non-league Macclesfield. The Manchester United icon has been out of work since being sacked by Plymouth Argyle earlier this year.",

      "According to The Sun, National League North side Macclesfield are eyeing a move for the former forward as they aim to find a replacement for Robbie Savage. He is set to leave the club for League Two side Forest Green Rovers.",
      "Savage spearheaded a stunning charge to promotion to the sixth tier of English football last season, Macclesfield winning 35 of their 42 games and collecting an eye-watering 109 points.",
      "And while club chiefs are keen on a move for Rooney, he has recently spoken out on his future and hinted that he wasn’t looking for a return to management any time soon. Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: “Obviously just doing some TV work at the minute, so that’s what I’m doing. I’m enjoying it. So, that’s where I’ll be.\"",
      "Meanwhile, his wife Colleen has also offered her take and claimed that Rooney’s punditry work was enough to keep him busy. She said: “At the minute, he's really happy on TV, podcasts and just being at home.",
      "“Plymouth was a bit far. It hasn't worked out at certain clubs. It's something he's passionate about. It's something he might revisit. He's passionate about TV.”",
      "Rooney was sacked by Plymouth back in January following a rotten spell at Home Park. He left with the club bottom of the Championship, while they were eventually relegated under his replacement Miron Muslic, who has since quit for German side Schalke.",
      "Ironically, Plymouth have now turned to another former United player in the form of Tom Cleverley, who was sacked by Watford at the end of the season. Meanwhile, Savage is still in talks over a move to Forest Green having previously claimed he would sack himself at Macclesfield should he fail to earn promotion.",
      "He said: “If I fail, I know my time will be up. I won’t be able to go back to being a director of football, sitting in the stands and judging other people if I’ve come up short. I know everything is on the line.",
      "“Some of the stuff that was said when I took on the job was unpleasant to say the least. It was a horrible summer.",
      "“But this team will get in the play-offs, and I believe we will go up, but if we don’t win promotion I will walk away from the dugout, take a back seat as a part-owner and watch from afar. There will be people who hope I fall flat on my face, but if that happens it won’t be for a lack of effort.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United have lost the opportunity to sign former wonderkid target Youssoufa Moukoko at a bargain price, years after Erling Haaland praised the Borussia Dortmund striker's skills on the pitch. The 20-year-old has been the subject of much transfer speculation over the years following his history-making Bundesliga debut.",
      "However, it now appears that the young talent will be leaving Germany and joining FC Copenhagen in an unexpected move for the former prodigy. The forward made history in 2020 by becoming the youngest player to debut in the German league at 16 years old during Dortmund's 5-2 victory over Hertha Berlin.",
      "Following the match, Manchester City forward Haaland, who was also with Der BVB at the time, hailed Moukoko as the best young player he'd ever seen. He said: \"He's the biggest talent in the world right now. I am over 20, I am getting old now!\"",
      "This wasn't the first time Haaland had lavished praise on Moukoko. He told the Bundesliga's official website that the young striker was superior to him at that age, adding: \"Moukoko is much better than I was at his age.",
      "\"The advantage for him is that he's already playing for Dortmund at the age of 15. At his age, I was still playing for my home town of Bryne.\"",
      "Now, five years later, Moukoko is securing his transfer from the German club, but not to the major European giant that many would anticipate.",
      "In 2022, United were quoted a hefty £26.2million for the promising young striker, who was garnering attention from rivals such as Liverpool, as well as European giants Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "At the time, Moukoko's representative, Patrick Williams, was frank when he spoke to BILD about his client's need for more game time to blossom. He made the point to warn Dortmund over the looming end of the player's contract.",
      "Williams said: \"It is not a matter of course that Youssoufa is extending BVB. Of course, many clubs are interested in Youssoufa, that's no secret. The end of his contract in the summer of 2023 is getting closer, the top clubs have that on the slip.",
      "\"Yes, injuries have thrown him back a bit this season. Yes, the competition at BVB is of course great. But he hardly gets the playing time that he needs in the current phase of his career in Dortmund. So of course we think about what is best for the future.\"",
      "Unfortunately, a transfer to United never came to fruition, and Moukoko is reportedly now heading off to Copenhagen for a much more modest £4.3million. Fabrizio Romano has reported that the star will undergo a medical on Friday, paving the way for a new journey in the Superliga.",
      "Even though Moukoko has slipped through their fingers, the Red Devils aren’t avoiding making any transfer moves this summer. United have already secured Brazilian star Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million on a five-year deal, signalling their intent for the future.",
      "It's also been reported that they're set to beat Tottenham Hotspur to the post in signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, with the 25-year-old on the verge of sealing a £60m deal with the Red Devils.",
      "However, boss Ruben Amorim will be keen for more arrivals at Old Trafford - and departures too - in what is sure to be a hectic few weeks ahead of the Premier League season kick-off.",

      "With that in mind, Chelsea agreeing a £55million deal for the transfer of Borussia Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens would have made United stand up and take notice.",
      "First of all, because Chelsea was seen as a possible landing spot for Garnacho and now the fact they are signing Gittens, and already have Noni Madueke, Pedro Neto, Tyrique George and Willian Estevao as winger options, it all but rules that prospect out.",
      "But, more importantly, it gives United an important transfer benchmark.",
      "Gittens scored 12 goals and registered five assists last season. It is a fine return for a 20-year-old winger but Garnacho, who is the same age, managed 11 goals and 10 assists.",
      "It means Garnacho had four more goal contributions last term and he also had 10 goals and seven assists to his name the season before.",
      "Garnacho has proven in two consecutive seasons he can perform in the Premier League and his stats are better than Gittens - who remains unproven at Premier League level.",
      "That is not to say Gittens isn't a good player. He's an exciting talent whose potential has an incredibly high ceiling. But if £55million is the going rate for Gittens then United should not go lower than that.",
      "Dortmund have proven to be excellent sellers in the past. United have to take a leaf out of their book and extract the best possible price for Garnacho this summer."

      "“But hey, as long as Antony hasn’t committed to a third party, we, with the utmost humility, are going to play our cards to be able to opt for Antony. I insist, despite being a complex operation, we will try to carry it out in different ways without mortgaging the club .",

      "The report claims Villa could be forced to cash in on Martinez in order to remain compliant with the Premier League's spending rules. It's said that Unai Emery's side are aware that the Blues are in the market for a new shot-stopper.",

      "And the 2018 World Cup winner is now free to play again and has been linked with a move to several clubs, including his former team.

      "Sesko is believed to be Mikel Arteta’s preferred signing, but Gyokeres was very much still in the running due to his lower price tag.

Ruben Amorim's arrival saw Ugarte play a much more prominent role, but he struggled during his first season in England and was an unused substitute for the Europa League final.",
      "Casemiro's European football renaissance made him an automatic pick for the Europa League final, with Bruno Fernandes chosen to play alongside the Brazilian.

      "They weren't laughing for long as Casemiro showed he hadn't lost the quality that saw him contribute to five Champions League triumphs during his time at Real Madrid.

      "Gyokeres is one of Europe's most in-demand players this summer after scoring a sensational 97 goals in 102 matches since joining Sporting in 2023. He bagged 39 league goals last season to help them win a league and cup double.",
      "It was widely expected that Gyokeres would be the centre of one of the most hectic transfer sagas this window but fall-out with Sporting CP over his price tag has left his future in limbo. Arsenal are also understood to be keen but are prioritising a move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Reports this week have claimed that Gyokeres has made a U-turn on United after previously preferring a move to the Emirates Stadium. Now, with the new financial year approaching on July 1, Gyokeres' move could finally be about to materialise.",
      "Germanijak.HR in Croatia have reported that Sporting CP have set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic to replace Gyokeres. The report claims that the Croatian striker has plenty of suitors after scoring 20 goals last season.",
      "The striker joined the Belgian side last summer after impressing for Rijeka, helping end Union SG's 90-year wait to be crowned champions. In 46 games, Ivanovic bagged an impressive 16 goals in the Pro League.",
      "It's led to reports that Sporting have already made their move to sign the 21-year-old with an offer of €20million (£17m). The opening bid was rejected by Union SG with the Belgium champions setting a price tag of €30m (£25.6m), at the very minimum.",

      "Sporting already have Conrad Hamer at the club but losing Gyokeres is expected to force them to bring in a replacement. Ivanovic's potential move to Lisbon would be the ultimate green light for United to finally land their target.",
      "Getting a striker for under £30m with an impressive goalscoring record may also help United in their negotiations for Gyokeres. Sporting CP are said to want around £68m for the striker, despite a 'gentleman's agreement' being in place to allow him to leave for less."

      "Sancho, 25, spent this season on loan at the west London club but did not sufficiently impress to earn a permanent move. Instead, Chelsea opted to pay £5million to Manchester United to get out of a mandatory purchase agreement to avoid signing Sancho.",
      "It now seems Chelsea are honing in on Dortmund winger Gittens as he prepares for a potential return to Cobham this summer. Niko Kovac explained Gittens' absence from his team's Club World Cup victory over Ulsan, claiming it was due to illness, though there have been murmurs that the player's no-show was linked to an impending transfer.",
      "The Sun has reported Chelsea are on the verge of completing a £55.5m deal for the winger. Gittens, 20, has taken a similar career path to Sancho in that he joined Dortmund from Manchester City's academy, and he too could be poised for a major Premier League comeback.",
      "Sancho, who is now in a state of limbo at United, turned heads at the Westfalenstadion himself before making a temporary switch back to the club last year.

      "Gittens and Sancho were team-mates in Germany for just six months, yet it's clear the latter left a lasting impression. Reflecting on a standout 2023/24 season, former Chelsea trainee Gittens acknowledged the influence Sancho had on him in that time.",
      "\"I've learned a lot from Jadon,\" he told WAZ last year. \"For example, that I have to play with one or two touches more often, that I have to offer deeper runs more often. And when he plays, he enjoys himself; I've learned that too. Jadon is a friend.\"",
      "Gittens had a short stint in Chelsea's academy as a young player but never fully joined their ranks. Coincidentally, he made his Champions League debut in a 1-0 victory over the Premier League titans in February 2023.",
      "After netting 12 goals in 49 appearances for Dortmund last season (both career highs), Gittens seems to have piqued Chelsea's interest once more. And it appears Sancho is among those championing him as he gears up for a potential summer return."

      "You couldn't argue with the silverware that had been added to the trophy cabinet, but what you could argue against was a shocking record in the transfer market and a non-existent style of play after two years at the club.",
      "United's decision not to part ways with Ten Hag last summer set them back years, with millions spent in the summer transfer window and the team regressing markedly in the Dutchman's third season at the club.",
      "A mid-season managerial change is never ideal, let alone when the new boss brings with him such a distinct style of play. However, as bad as last season was, at least Ruben Amorim has a clear vision moving forward, something United have lacked for far too long.",
      "Ralf Rangnick addressed that issue during his time as interim boss prior to Ten Hag's arrival, using Liverpool and Manchester City as examples United should look to follow after a humiliating defeat against the former in April 2022.",

      "If Madrid do sign him for £42m, United would receive between £16.8m-£20m. If the actual sell-on clause is closer to the 20 per cent mark, United would then bank around £7.4m.",
      "Now, a move could accelerate at the perfect time for United after Benfica crashed out of the Club World Cup. After beating Bayern Munich earlier this week, Bruno Lage's men lost 4-1 to Chelsea after extra-time on Saturday meaning Carreras is now set to decide on his future."

That being said, his 13-goal haul wasn't too dissimilar to the 10 he managed in his final season at United, and so it would be wrong to suggest he's suddenly turned into a different player away from United.",

      "We even saw Fabrizio Romano looking ever so slightly exasperated at having to explain that Gyokeres “didn’t say no” to Manchester United but also definitely didn’t say yes as if he was talking Red Devils fans down from a ledge, and he bloody loves this stuff.",
      "He knows as well as we do that it’s these sort of transfer sagas that keep him in multiple mobiles and whatever else he spends his money on, and essentially pays our wages. And this one really is a doozy: two big-name strikers; two Premier League giants; desperation on each and every side.",
      "There are multiple angles to approach it from, opportunities for nuance for those tricksy headline writers and therefore thousands upon thousands of transfer-obsessed eyeballs lapping up every last update, U-turn and plot twist.",
      "We both want it to rumble on so we can garner those sweet, sweet clicks and for it to stop immediately so we can write about something, anything besides. But even if we have to grin and bear it for several more weeks while our advertisers rub their hands with glee, with a goal-orientated mindset we can all take solace in the likely outcome being very, very funny.",
      "The thought of United feeding on Arsenal’s transfer ‘scraps’ is in itself delightful. But far better than that is the very good chance that one of Gyokeres or Sesko will flop while the other shines having either won or lost the race to sign for Arsenal.",
      "Both being held in such high regard means it would be funny no matter which of them flops at which club. Manchester United spending another £60m-odd on a striker to score no goals is funny. Better than that? Gyokeres being that striker having scored them at a rate of one every 84 minutes under the very same manager at Sporting. That would excellent.",

      "But not as excellent as Arsenal starting the season with the striker they’ve needed for half a decade before reverting to Kai Havertz come Christmas and then Mikel Merino when it comes to the Champions League punch in March, before we’re all treated to the revisionist pundits insisting they didn’t ever think a striker was the answer anyway.",
      "And that brings us to our ideal scenario. We want Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, after what may or may not have been but have certainly been reported to be several flip flops between the two strikers, to choose Gyokeres as their flop because a) he has very little sell-on value as a 27-year-old, b) their concerns over him scoring goals in a minor league would prove to be amusingly well-founded, and c) (and this is absolutely the main reason) he was Manchester United’s first choice all along.",
      "Even if Sesko somehow weirdly decided there was a different option after being snubbed by Arsenal and didn’t join the transfer market scavengers, we will have been well sated by Gyokeres being utterly terrible for the Gunners given they will have both chosen him and won a battle with United to secure his signature.

      "Viktor Gyokeres has come to an ‘agreement’ with Sporting over his transfer this summer while one ‘condemned’ Manchester United star is ‘set to stay’ after a shock U-turn.",
      "Gyokeres is desperate to leave Sporting this summer and wants to join Arsenal, who are currently deciding between him and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko as their new No.9.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently dismissed reported claims that the Sweden international had a gentleman’s agreement to leave the club for well below his £85m asking price, though it’s thought they are willing to let him leave for around £65m this summer.",
      "Arsenal are said to have made a bid of around £55m which has been rejected, and are currently deciding whether to launch a new offer while United wait in the wings.",
      "It’s been claimed that the Red Devils could end up feeding on the Gunners’ transfer ‘scraps’ – signing whichever out of Gyokeres or Sesko doesn’t get their desired move to the Emirates.",
      "In any case, both clubs, but perhaps Gyokeres most of all, have been handed a boost in order to get the deal done, with The Sun claiming Sporting have reached an ‘agreement’ with the striker that he need not return for pre-season on Tuesday, giving Arsenal, United or other suitors until July 7 to get the deal done.",
      "Meanwhile, United have been dealt a blow in their bid to reduce their wage bill this summer as previously ‘condemned’ £350,000-per-week midfielder Casemiro is ‘set to stay’, according to Mirror.",
      "The Brazilian has – somewhat unfairly – been seen as a poster boy for United’s demise, with pundits and fans using his £60m transfer on a four-year-deal as a 30-year-old on massive wages as a sign of the fuzzy thinking at Old Trafford.",
      "Reports when Ruben Amorim arrived to replace Erik ten Hag claimed Casemiro ‘didn’t interest him’ and would be one of the first out in a ‘clean up’ in order to make space on the wage bill.",
      "The Portuguese coach ‘wanted him out’ in January and was left ‘raging’ when the club bosses failed to find a buyer.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe then brutally named Casemiro when listing five “not good enough” or “overpaid” (or both) players as he discussed the club’s financial woes with Gary Neville.",
      "Reports of United’s desperate search for a club to take Casemiro off their hands amid reported interest from Saudi Arabia and the player’s apparent willingness to leave continued for most of the season, but his increased role in Amorim’s side towards the end of the campaign and an uptick in his performances changed the dynamic.",
      "Amorim then performed a U-turn and backed the midfielder to see out his contract at Old Trafford as he wants to retain leaders in his dressing room, and now – having earned a shock recall for Brazil by Carlo Ancelotti earlier this month – Casemiro now wants to stay as he believes he has a better chance of playing in the 2026 World Cup if he remains at United.",
      "We’re all tired of the Gyokeres or Sesko to Arsenal or Man Utd nonsense, but if we can just hang on the outcome looks set to be very, very funny.",

      "Players expected to make intra-Premier League moves took priority for us, as they’re more interesting — with a couple of exceptions, like European champions Paris Saint-Germain wanting a Bournemouth player.",
      "",
      "GK: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nHe cried as he waved goodbye to the Villa Park faithful in Aston Villa’s penultimate match of the season. There aren’t many clearer signs a player is leaving than that, surely?",
      "Martinez is ready for a fresh challenge and is apparently desperate to join Manchester United, which should be enough to put off other potential suitors, because honestly, what is he on?",
      "We also had the option to pick from Chelsea’s goalkeepers. Kepa Arrizabalaga is closing in on a move to Arsenal, youngster Mike Penders will leave on loan to continue his progression into a Thibaut Courtois regen, and Djordje Petrovic is surplus to requirements after a stellar campaign on loan at Strasbourg in France.",
      "",
      "RB: Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nThe majority of the Chelsea squad would be sold in an instant if a decent enough bid comes in. There are some exceptions like Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the money the Blues would accept being at world-record level — which is never going to be offered.",
      "Disasi spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and frequently played right-back for them after doing so for Chelsea. He’s 27 now and clearly not wanted at Stamford Bridge. His Villa Park loan didn’t do much to increase his value, but the Blues will be confident they can flog him back to France, or maybe even Saudi Arabia if it comes to that.",
      "",
      "CB: Nayef Aguerd (West Ham)\nFor pure variety reasons, we have shifted Disasi to the right and brought in Aguerd, rather than including Aston Villa youngster and natural right-back Kosta Nedeljkovic right after Martinez.",
      "Despite hoping to avoid returning loanees when possible, we’ve gone back-to-back in that respect. Moroccan international Aguerd spent last season at Real Sociedad and a permanent departure is on the cards.",
      "There’s interest from Italy in the form of Juventus and Roma, which kind of suggests he should be starting for West Ham…",
      "",
      "CB: Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth)\nPerhaps the most debatable name on this list as Bournemouth have already sold half of their defence and aren’t re-signing their on-loan goalkeeper, but PSG are hell-bent on landing Zabarnyi. The writing is on the wall.",
      "Zabarnyi is a very impressive young centre-back who was overshadowed by the younger Dean Huijsen, who has signed for Real Madrid. Milos Kerkez has also joined Liverpool for £40million. Bournemouth are going to look very different next season.",
      "",
      "LB: Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nArsenal are going to get rubbish money for Zinchenko, but they’ll still move him on. He only has one year left on his contract and earns £150,000 a week [Capology], so anything over £10million will probably suffice.",
      "There’s reportedly interest from Atletico Madrid, who are also considering signing Liverpool’s Andy Robertson. In the Premier League, Fulham have been linked as Marco Silva looks to continue his evil plan to become Arsenal B.",

      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Manchester City)\nWe really have zero clue what’s next for Phillips. This never seemed possible, but even Leeds United are reportedly unwilling to go near him now. Every player in this XI has interest, but not Phillips. It’s anyone’s guess where he ends up. The idea of a move to Rangers or Celtic makes so much sense in my head. More so Rangers — he feels right for Russell Martin’s system.",
      "Phillips spent last season on loan at Ipswich Town, who got relegated with a pathetic 22 points. He had his injury problems, but looked poor at the start of the season and got sent off against Leicester City on matchday 10, which resulted in a one-game ban. He didn’t return for nearly two months thanks to an ankle injury and being an unused substitute three times.",
      "If he couldn’t get sufficient minutes for the second-worst team in the Premier League, how is he expected to stay at Man City? Well, he isn’t.",
      "",
      "CM: Sean Longstaff (Newcastle United)\nThe pure profit Newcastle are seeking from the sale of Longstaff should help them, though we can’t imagine him fetching a large fee. If Christian Norgaard is worth £10m, surely he is worth around the same, taking into account his homegrown status.",
      "Newcastle have outgrown Longstaff, and there’s minimal chance he usurps Sandro Tonali or Bruno Guimaraes in Eddie Howe’s pecking order. Those two are in a different stratosphere, with all due respect.",
      "",
      "CM: Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nIncluding Eberechi Eze was tempting, but he’s not guaranteed to leave Crystal Palace, is he? There’s a decent chance he does, but it’s hard to envision him pushing for an exit and getting all arsey about it.",
      "Elliott has discussed his future, saying he doesn’t want to waste his best years sitting on the bench for Liverpool, and there should be lots of clubs interested in signing him this summer. Everton are a frustratingly good fit, but that doesn’t seem likely because of, you know, the rivalry and that.",

      "MORE: Liverpool must answer Elliott question, Carsley next for England and Joe Hart continues to impress",
      "",
      "RW: Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nManchester United looked destined to sign Mbeumo but have been messing around with their valuation, with Brentford standing very firm. This has allowed Tottenham Hotspur to creep in, and even with Thomas Frank’s appointment, the Cameroonian hasn’t exactly had his head turned. He’s certainly open to joining Spurs if the Red Devils don’t get a grip, but Old Trafford is his preferred destination.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is an honourable mention. Bournemouth are under no pressure to sell and their asking price is reportedly £70m, which Semenyo is not worth.",
      "",
      "LW: Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nSancho and his pal Marcus Rashford are both available, but the latter’s wages make his exit more complicated. The former is also on a lot of money, but not as much, has played abroad before, and has a lower asking price; he’s clearly the more realistic permanent departure.",
      "Rumours of a move to Fenerbahce to play under Jose Mourinho have unfortunately been quashed, but there’s also interest from Italian clubs Napoli and Juventus.",
      "",
      "ST: Joao Pedro (Brighton)\nChelsea and Newcastle are both vying for Pedro’s signature this summer, and despite his departure leaving Brighton very light up front, it looks inevitable after a difficult end to 2024/25, which reportedly involved a training ground bust-up with Jan Paul van Hecke.",

The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nChelsea were linked with the Brighton striker but Newcastle always seemed most keen, which has led to a £50million offer. Brighton reportedly wanted £60million initially, but the forward has made it clear he wants to move on. We would expect the Magpies and Seagulls to find common ground soon. Pedro won’t be going to from the south coast to the North-East to play second fiddle. So what could that mean for Alexander Isak?",

Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",

      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We’re still waiting to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do something to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "6) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",

A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper.

      "What does Liverpool know about PSR…?\nTo funstar andy:\nNo, Liverpool wasnt always top 5 or top 8 since the 1950s. Why, there’s a gigantic statue of Bill Shankly becos he won LFC the championship in 1962… the 2nd division championship (back when the top division was division one). We spent at least a couple years looking up from a lower division.",
      "And big 6? Maybe. For some periods of time.",
      "But after we were sold to Dumb and Dumber Hicks and Gillette, who proceeded to shave us bald (ok, cold joke), we almost went bankrupt in 2010. If FSG (then known as NESV) hadnt convinced RBS to sell us for £300mil, we’d have been in administration, booted to Champo division, with no guarantee that we’d be back. We most definitely werent big 6 back then, as recently as 2010, barely 15 years ago.",
      "We had Roy Hodgson for manager (whom Stevie G thot the world of, lol, whilst he was critical of Rafa for playing him in his most devastating position of 10 or RW or LW just not 8 or 6), who bought Mark Konchesky for LB. We were in relegation positions when Roy was finally sacked after half a season. We had Joe Cole, whom Stevie G compared to Messi in training, and whom we spent years part paying his salary to get him off our books. We had Milan Jovanovic as our big ticket free agent, porn star lookalike Andriy Voronin as 10, no kidding. And we cheered for david ngog who was an improvement. Torres couldnt wait to jump off the boat the moment he got healthy and better.",
      "2010. FSG brought us back. However tightwad fans think they are, i’d always be grateful to them. They literally brought us back from our darkest time in recent memory.",
      "I know u guys had mike ashley for 14 years from 2007 till 2021. That’s a terrible decade and half, bouncing between divisions. But trust me, u dont want to get anywhere near bankruptcy, the way we did. It was a time lfc could really have disappeared for good.",
      "So no, we werent always top 6 since the 1950s. We almost disappeared in 2010, not too long ago.",
      "As tightwad as fsg are, and as frustrated as i am with them sometimes, they’ve proven their financially prudent management works. The club is profitable and the asset value has risen from £300 mil in 2010 to £3-4bil today. All without investing the kinds of crazy sums that sugar daddies do. (Read: forest, everton). In net spend terms, we’ve been consistently 5th or below, outspent by other clubs below us. So it’s doable, with lots of luck, skill, hard work.",

      "And Danny, LFC NY (now London) made fair points about the desire of many (most, I’d say) Newcastle supporters to ignore or even venerate the club’s new Saudi owners. And I agree with him that there’s too much whining about PSR from our lot.",
      "Although neither is completely wrong, I think both of them are oversimplifying these matters.",
      "While it’s true that the ostensible reason for PSR was to prevent clubs from unsustainable and destructive spending, that hasn’t particularly worked. Everton is only one EPL club that’s been in financial hot water (and I’m not just talking points deductions) since the rules were introduced. Heck, Ruben Amorim was insisting that ManU was about to go bankrupt at the start of their current spending spree.",
      "Additionally, because I gather that the rules only apply in the EPL, they do nothing to protect the clubs below them, where we’ve seen a number of clubs in dire straits recently. Those are the clubs that need PSR.",
      "Anyway, given that PIF is the richest club owner in the world, what exactly are these rules protecting us from?",
      "I’ve always suspected that PSR rules were also intended to rein in the growth of player costs; if so, it has failed utterly, to the sorrow of us relative minnows.",
      "Whatever the “reasons” for PSR, their effect has been confusion and frustration for clubs and their supporters, as the rules have militated against long- term planning, particularly for clubs bouncing in and out of the UCL. Nobody, but nobody, wanted to sell Elliott Anderson; PSR made that happen. On the other hand, that ridiculous deal last summer might have been (for us) the result of counting unhatched chickens with the Tonali and Gordon buys, given the 2023-24 league table.",
      "And every Liverpool supporter should understand that they were already among the richest clubs in the world in 2013, no matter how long it had been since they’d won the league: 10th in the world, according to a 2014 Forbes article using 2013 data. This was also the year that Real Madrid replaced ManU as the world’s wealthiest club.",
      "Whether Liverpool’s earlier long domination of English football was a result of doing things “the right way” is an open question, as far as I’m concerned. How often were they able to throw their financial weight around with smaller clubs? A lot, I’m guessing.",
      "But still, I’m hugely ambivalent about PSR. It frustrates me on behalf of clubs like Newcastle and Forest. But by not allowing a club like Newcastle to buy a billion dollars worth of players this summer, they do prevent all clubs (except evidently Chelsea) from just buying success. That’s a good thing. And yet again, they have contributed to a concentration of wealth at the top. That’s bad.",
      "I think there are versions of PSR that really would work and be fair, but this version ain’t one.",
      "(Also, Danny was just wrong about our recent signings. This is our fourth consecutive window without a first- team signing. It’s not complete, and we’ll sign players, but I should think James, NUFC could be forgiven for calling 22 months two years.)\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

But the main takeaway I have from that article is that the new signings meant that City ‘purred.’ They did. And in a competitive game, not a pre-season friendly.",

      "Teenagers: Depending on potential, must be described as one of ‘prospect’ if they’re average, ‘sensation’ if they have moments of brilliance, ‘prodigy’ if they’re enigmatic and not from Europe and ‘wunderkind’ if they’re already pretty good and from Europe.",
      "Early 20’s: Depending on the club they’re at and how often they’re featuring and how well they’re performing must be described as ‘player’ if they’re average, ‘mercurial’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘middling’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘star’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Late 20’s: As above, but ‘journeyman’ if they’re average, ‘frustrating’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘dross’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘world class’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Early 30’s: As above, but ‘experienced’ if they’re average, ‘unfulfilled potential’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘stealing a wage’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘a wise head’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Mid-late 30’s: As above although by now there are only two types, ‘veterans’ if they’re average but reliably so and ‘legends’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "After the late 30’s is no time for professional outfielders to be seriously playing and so the only labels available are ‘sad geriatric’ if they’re clogging around at the base of the league pyramid, probably doing so in the number 43 shirt because 4+3=7 and they used to wear 7 or ‘delusional egomaniac’ if they’re still clinging on in any kind of credible league while demanding a single digit squad number.",

      "I’d normally edit this down before sending it in, but during this period of off-season somnolence, I reckon you’re desperate enough to print it in full. So fair warning: it’s long.",
      "There’s an often-discussed feeling many of us can relate to: when that little-known band you follow suddenly make it big, when that book you enjoyed years ago gets made into a lavish HBO series and everyone is talking about it, or when that under-18s player you’ve been tracking through youth tournaments and reserve appearances steps up to the first team and bosses the midfield like a seasoned pro. Probably the Germans have a word for it: that mixture of pride, satisfaction, excitement, smugness, but also an indefinable sense of loss, as the special thing which was known only to yourself and a few other obsessive nerds goes mainstream. Now national journalists are writing in-depth columns about this exciting new thing, and the most basic of armchair fans is telling you, ‘Oh I really like so-and-so, have you heard of them?’",
      "There have been many heartwarmingly hilarious things about Man Utd’s decline over the last decade-plus: Moyes, Fellaini, Pogba, Ed Woodward, Antony. The club has been like a clown car that just keeps giving out: every time you think enough daftness has emerged from that apparently-finite-sized vehicle, out pops another grinning idiot in polyester wig and enormous shoes, tripping over his own feet and crashing into lampposts.",
      "But spare a moment’s thought for the ABU. Utd’s continued dedication to wringing the neck of their own legacy has turned everyone not born within 30 miles of TTOD into a loud, proud member of the ABU gang. ABUism has gone mainstream. I’ve been growing a touch concerned by how easy it is for this new generation to flaunt their Utd-baiting credentials, so I’m going to offer some important historical context to the younger ABUers out there.",
      "READ: Newcastle blame Manchester United, makes Rashford U-turn and launch worst £125m ‘triple-swoop’ ever",
      "You see, ABUism didn’t used to be so easy. I know this will shock some, but back in the day, Man Utd were good; and when they weren’t good, they were lucky, and when they weren’t good or lucky they were still twice as rich as everyone else. Being an ABU in those days was lonely work. As Man Utd hoovered up title after title, with one of the most stubborn managers in history helming every aspect of the club with iron authority, us ABUs were the laughing stock of school playgrounds and pub saloons up and down the country. Where to turn, for the humiliated ABU, as Utd win the league with 79 points? How do you maintain your dignity, when Utd have just won three league titles in a row and another UCL on top, and we’ve stopped even bothering to count the FA and league cups?",
      "In those days, us ABUs had to nurture the flame of our passion quietly, even secretively. I grew up in suburban south London, where Man Utd ‘supporters’ were ten-a-dozen. Being an ABU in those circumstances was not easy, but for some of us, it was never a conscious choice. My dad was an ABU; his dad was an ABU. Cut me open and I bleed ABU. To this day, my old man proudly recounts the tale to anyone who’ll listen of how my mum tried to put a red dummy in my mouth and I spat it on the floor. ‘Fuck United!’ I babbled, and these were my very first words.",
      "Back when Utd were so good they were inevitable, being an ABU meant something. For many Utd supporters, That Night in Barcelona stands as the greatest moment in their sporting lives; and in a way it was for me, too, but for entirely opposite reasons. As I sat in the bosom of three generations of my ABU family, and together we watched that Norwegian goblin prod the ball home for the most undeserving winning goal in the history of sport, and wept as those scarlet-bibbed idiots celebrated in a sweaty Manc pile, I knew I belonged: the passionate, white-hot hatred I felt was meaning, purpose, identity, community. The very next morning, my old man and I got matching tattoos: a camp little devil being sodomised by a Kaiser Wilhelm-style old dude. The devil screams his safe word: ABU! ABU! But Kaiser Wilhelm is just laughing and sodomising, laughing and sodomising. My girlfriend has begged me to get this tattoo lasered off (it’s in a very particular, usually-covered place). I’ve told her repeatedly: I love you, you’re my soulmate, we’ll grow old together. But I would sooner die than erase this part of myself.",
      "It was a tough, brutal time, and sometimes you had to defend your ABU beliefs with your life. But it inculcated a defiance, a determination to persist. We were hacking through the tough times towards those longed-for sunlit uplands. And now – here we are. The sunlit uplands are everything we hoped for: bountiful, nourishing and, most importantly, hilarious. Every year, Utd find new depths of ineptitude to plumb. Every year their rhetoric grows more and more detached from reality. Every year they circle closer to the holy grail, the utopia of relegation. And yet, something feels slightly off, for me at least. I look around at the happy faces of the new, young breed of ABUs, those who’ve never known anything but success, never known first-hand quite how terrifyingly omnipotent Utd can be. I meet the eyes of my fellow lifelong ABUs, those of us past 35ish years old, and I see old scars lurking beneath the merriment. Are there enough of us still standing? Some, it is true, have started to abandon the battlefield, wearied by the fight. They say they feel sorry for Utd, that the Prem needs a strong Utd to make it competitive. Let them go: we don’t need them. But those of us who remain are constantly totting up the numbers, evaluating the condition of our fellow warriors. The young’uns are untested in the theatre of war, so how trustworthy are they really? What if, against all reason, sense and logic, Amorim’s plan starts to bear fruit? What if Mbuemo and Cunha turn Utd into the most potent attack in the league? What if they raise north of £200m selling Onana, Maguire, Mainoo, Antony, Sancho, Rashford and Hoijlund, and reinvest it efficiently and effectively? What if, revitalised, they start chasing down Liverpool, Arsenal and City? If Utd rise again, will the new generation of ABUs have the grit to see it through? Or will they, like so many previous generations of Surrey-based milksops, fold under the pressure and start claiming, ‘Well I’ve supported them since my dad drove past the Trafford Centre once in 1976’?",
      "I didn’t mean for this to develop into an ‘aging-man-gets-angry-at-the-modern-world-as-it-races-away-from-him’ diatribe. I don’t want to denigrate the young’uns out there, taking their first steps into the world of ABUism. But I just want them to know – if any of them have put down their Tiktoks long enough to read this far – that it wasn’t always this easy to laugh at Man Utd. For two decades, it was really bloody difficult, actually. And despite the absolute calamity of the last few years, the club remains rich enough and prestigious enough to mount a comeback. So it might happen. If that day comes, me and the other OGs are gonna be out here, standing tall, the old defiance rekindled, ready to ride again. Can we rely on you youngers to stand alongside us, even as Utd drop £250m on a 28-year-old Lamine Yamal and go on to win their second treble in two seasons?",

      "",
      "10) Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal) – Undisclosed\nCards on the table, we have no idea what Lewis-Skelly is on. What is for sure is that he’s among the highest-paid teenagers in the world. His new five-year contract is almost certainly worth somewhere between £25,000 and £100,000 per week. If we were to guess (and it’s nothing more than a guess), we’d say he’s taking home £50,000 a week. That’s more than £2.5m annually.",
      "MORE: The Famous F365 Friday Quiz: Wonderkids edition…",
      "",
      "=8) Marc Guiu (Chelsea) – £50,000 p/w\nThe most baffling inclusion in this teenage rich list. Chelsea were obviously willing to offer Guiu big money due to his low transfer fee (€6million) and the fact he’s tied down until 2029.",
      "",
      "=8) Oscar Bobb (Manchester City) – £50,000 p/w\nWe reckon Bobb is just about more deserving of his hefty wage, but his City future is uncertain after a lengthy injury.",
      "",
      "7) Pau Cubarsi (Barcelona) – £64,917 p/w\nOne of two Barcelona players here, Cubarsi committed his future to his boyhood club on a four-year deal worth €4million per year.",
      "",
      "6) Lucas Bergvall (Tottenham Hotspur) – £65,000 p/w\nSpurs beat Barcelona to the signing of Bergvall and all of a sudden, it makes perfect sense.",
      "",
      "5) Endrick (Real Madrid) – £67,513 p/w\nBrazilian wonderkid Endrick is Real Madrid’s highest-earning teenager, taking the mantle from Arda Guler, who left his teenage years behind in February. We’re looking forward to discovering how much Franco Mastantuono is earning.",
      "",
      "4) Archie Gray (Tottenham Hotspur) – £75,000 p/w\nMathys Tel earns £80k a week at Spurs, but he turned 20 in April, so the Londoners’ only have two representatives. Pathetic.",
      "Gray cost around £40m last summer, leaving boyhood club Leeds United.",
      "",
      "3) Leny Yoro (Manchester United) – £115,000 p/w\nSigned from Lille last summer, French defender Yoro is the second-most expensive teenager in Premier League history and one of 15 United players on a six-figure weekly wage. They’re grateful to be cutting that figure down from 17 with Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen leaving for nothing.",
      "Top earner Casemiro, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are all available, while United also wouldn’t stand in the way of Harry Maguire, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee, Andre Onana or Luke Shaw leaving if suitable offers arrive.",

      "2) Warren Zaire-Emery (PSG) – £185,012 p/w\nThe French international penned a lucrative five-year contract in April 2024 to become the highest-paid teenager in the world. Now second, he takes home nearly £200k per week at PSG.",
      "",
      "1) Lamine Yamal (Barcelona) – £270,540 p/w\nComfortably the youngest on this list is also comfortably the highest-paid teenager in the world – and of all time.",
      "Yamal earns a base salary of £270,540 per week and a further £169,108 in bonuses, meaning he takes home £439,648 every bloody week, at the age of 17.",
      "He is under contract for seven years, meaning he’ll still be very young when it expires. It’s honestly frightening. Every single statistic about the Barcelona wonderkid makes me sick. And he could win the Ballon d’Or.",

      "Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing the Brazilian midfielder and if the Blues receive a very handsome offer they probably would sell; they have Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo, and seem to value profit over keeping very capable players.",
      "Should Santos stay at Stamford Bridge, he is guaranteed to make a positive impact. There’s a lot of football to be played next season and Chelsea will be jaded going into the campaign after the Club World Cup.",
      "He should be above Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in Enzo Maresca’s pecking order and competing with Romeo Lavia as Fernandez’s deputy. And given Lavia’s injury issues, Santos could become an important player if he isn’t flogged in the summer transfer window.",

      "Valencia massively benefited from the appointment of Carlos Corberan as head coach, enjoying a dramatic upturn in results as the players began enjoying their football in a functional system.",
      "They were in relegation trouble when the ex-West Brom boss joined, but after losing his first game against Real Madrid, Corberan enjoyed a run of only two La Liga defeats – against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid – in 17 matches.",

      "It was absolutely the correct decision to keep the 19-year-old in France. In 30 Ligue 2 appearances, he scored an impressive 22 goals and helped Lorient gain promotion as champions.",

      "Fabio Vieira (Arsenal)\nThe chances of a significant return impact are low, but not non-existent.",
      "He might be lightweight and yet to really prove himself in 33 Premier League appearances, but Vieira’s technical ability will always create the lingering thought that he could come good.",
      "Arsenal could’ve done with Vieira last season when Martin Odegaard was injured and then struggling in the second half of the campaign — and that lack of attacking midfield depth could be what convinces Mikel Arteta to give the Portuguese playmaker another chance.",

      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nNever going to happen, is it? But if Ruben Amorim and Rashford don’t put their differences behind them and promise to be better in their relationship, the latter is going to be leaving on loan every single summer until his contract expires. That might be more useful than ripping up his contract now, but it’s still wildly impractical for everyone involved.",
      "Rashford just needs to enjoy his football and be shown a bit of love from his manager to thrive. He looked electric at times on loan at Aston Villa last season, and United boss Amorim is actively seeking a difference-making attacker in the transfer window. You’ve got one right here, mate. Come on…kiss and make up.",

      "Robbie Keane suggested trust was something the manager would look for when compiling his Tottenham squad, but it seems that trust will not be returned by Mbeumo.",
      "Keane said: ‘All eyes will be on the transfer window now. When a manager comes in, he always wants to bring his own people in. Whether that’s Brentford players or not, I’m not sure, but he certainly knows he can trust his former players.",
      "‘Bryan Mbeumo is one who I think could come and fit in well. He’s had good season, scored some goals and got some assists, and now has teams like Man Utd looking at him. I’d expect him to do very well at Spurs.’",

      "Teddy Sheringham has praised Bruno Fernandes for staying at “big club” Manchester United while they “aren’t at the top of their game.”",
      "Fernandes has been United’s best player for essentially his entire spell there. He’s deservedly the captain, being the club’s talisman, with 98 goals and 86 assists in 290 games there.",
      "Last season, Fernandes was quite obviously the best player at United by some way, as he was directly involved in 19 Premier League goals during a 15th-placed season, and helped push them to the Europa League final with seven goals and four assists.",
      "This summer, he had the opportunity to head to Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal reportedly offering £100million for his services, but he turned it down.",
      "At the time, he said he still wanted to play “at the highest level possible,” which is in Europe.",
      "Sheringham has praised the United captain for not ditching the club despite them being in hard times.",
      "He told Racing Tipster: “I think it’s great that Fernandes wants to stay. He realises what a big club United are. United probably had that same thought, where they could have sold him to Saudi Arabia for 100 million or something like that, for a 30-year-old.",
      "“They could have landed big money to really start recharging the batteries at United with new players.",
      "“But good on Fernandes. He realises that United obviously aren’t at the top of their game at the moment, but they’re still one of the biggest football clubs around. You want to stay there for as long as you can.",
      "“I really like Bruno. He’s head and shoulders the best player. You would much rather have a Manchester United team with him in it than without him.”",
      "It is clear that United are a better side with Fernandes in, and they are fortunate that he was strong enough to turn down what was reported as a three-year contract worth around £200million.",
      "That sort of money is not likely to be offered within Europe, but if a big sum did come in from a club in the continent who are of a comfortably higher standing that United, there’s a chance the Red Devils would not have been so lucky.",
      "But whether anyone in Europe will come in with a big offer for him after he showed loyalty to United is a question in itself now, with the fact Fernandes is soon to be 31 also a potential barrier to a big move.",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",

      "Gyokeres is one of two strikers along with Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal are said to be choosing between to lead their line next season.",
      "One report on Friday claimed Sesko is ‘ready to join’ while another a few hours later insisted Gyokeres ‘will sign’ for the Gunners. We don’t know what to believe and at this point would quite like Andrea Berta to sh*t or get off the pot.",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs claimed earlier this week that United may well be feeding on Arsenal’s scraps in their bid to land a new striker – essentially, they can have whichever striker Arsenal don’t want.",
      "“It could be a scenario where whoever Arsenal go for it opens the door for Manchester United for the other,” Jacobs said.",
      "“The natural expectation is that if Gyokeres doesn’t join Arsenal he hasn’t rejected Manchester United, so he could be a possibility, but I’m told also not to discount a scenario where Gyokeres goes to Arsenal and Sesko comes back into Manchester United’s thinking as well because 12 months ago they made a strong pitch and Sesko decided to stay at Leipzig.”",
      "That scenario is at odds with reports earlier this month which claimed Gyokeres had ‘rejected’ United, but Romano backed up Jacobs’ claim, insisting that what is currently a ‘closed door’ could reopen for the Sporting striker’s move to Old Trafford should Arsenal decide to plump for Sesko.",
      "“The question for many United fans is has Viktor Gyokeres rejected Manchester United to go to Arsenal? Guys let me explain the Gyokeres situation – Gyokeres has not told ‘Man United no I’m not coming goodbye’,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“His agent, speaking to Man United almost ten days ago told Manchester United that his priority is Arsenal. So the priority of Viktor Gyokeres is to go to Arsenal – he would love to go to Arsenal for several reasons, including obviously Champions League football, but Viktor Gyokeres didn’t say no to Manchester United.",
      "“So, the priority of the player is Arsenal, the player is waiting for Arsenal. Arsenal are waiting to understand how much Viktor Gyokeres will cost.",

      "The Club World Cup has been a breeze for Manchester City so far, and Juventus were the latest to be brushed aside — on a particularly enjoyable day for one summer signing.",
      "Man City have played an absolute blinder here. Rayan Ait-Nouri for £31 million is one hell of a bargain — one that should make Wolves supporters sick to their stomach and Manchester United fans wonder why they signed Patrick Dorgu and not this guy.",
      "We were quick to write off Rayan Cherki after one game, and we’re just as ready to declare Ait-Nouri the best left-back in the world after only his second game for the club.",
      "On a comfortable Orlando afternoon (rainstorm aside) for Pep Guardiola’s men, the Algerian left-back was absolutely fantastic. His decisive through ball to assist Jeremy Doku for City’s opener was sublime, leaving Juventus defender Alberto Costa for dead and Pierre Kalulu, for some reason, unaware that the Belgian would cut in onto his right foot.",
      "There was plenty of transfer narrative, with Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders thriving — and a couple of Premier League targets doing absolutely nothing of note on the other side. Dusan Vlahovic got his goal in the end, and it was very well taken, but didn’t do enough to convince potential suitors he’s their man, while City-linked stars Kenan Yildiz and Andrea Cambiaso both started on the bench.",
      "MORE: Wirtz, Delap, Cunha: Top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window",
      "It’s City’s new boys who started on Thursday that really stole the show. Reijnders and Ait-Nouri have added youth, energy and a much-needed injection of self-belief to a team that spent most of last season feeling sorry for themselves. Guardiola is treating this tournament as the start of 2025/26 — and who can blame him after the empty-handed mess that was 2024/25?",
      "It’s the right call — and with Ait-Nouri leading the charge, City purred in possession. But for all the early signs of a slick new core forming, there were also some pretty loud reminders that the old core is, well…getting older.",
      "They’re still comfortable trying to break down teams, but transitions look like a weakness. Ederson choosing this moment to gift Juventus an equaliser — right after telling the world he wants to stay at City — was not ideal. That might not be your decision, fella.",
      "Luckily for him, Kalulu had an absolute shocker to outdo it, scoring one of the most avoidable own goals you’ll ever see, handing City the lead back.",
      "It was tight going into the second half, with the first somehow played to a finish despite monsoon conditions. But one simple like-for-like change blew it wide open.",
      "There were acres of space all game between Juventus’ deepest midfielder and their backline, with Omar Marmoush camped on the defender’s shoulder with his back to goal. Bringing on Erling Haaland was the easiest tactical decision Guardiola’s ever made. Igor Tudor had to react, but no adjustment could stop City slicing through with the same defence-splitting passes every five minutes.",
      "Reijnders — who’s already looking like a monstrous signing — was the one to deliver a gorgeous through ball to Matheus Nunes, who, as it turns out, might actually be a bloody decent right-back. Haaland was left completely free to tap in his 300th career goal with one of the scruffiest finishes you’ll ever see.",
      "Juve chucked on some positive subs in desperation, but City were rampant. Soon it was 4-1 — Phil Foden tapping in after Haaland produced a silky first touch and perfectly weighted through ball to set up Savinho. His calm touch around Michele Di Gregorio left Foden with a walk-in.",
      "Then came the pick of the bunch: a thunderous long-range belter from Savinho that left Di Gregorio rooted as embarrassment for the Old Lady turned to outright humiliation.",
      "There was still time for Rayan Cherki to miss an absolute sitter, but overall it was a very productive afternoon in Florida for City. They’re the only team to win all three of their group games at the Club World Cup and should be the clear favourites to lift the trophy.",
      "While this tournament could yet take a toll on their domestic campaign through sheer physical and mental fatigue, winning it might also provide the boost they need. The pre-CWC signings already look like inspired additions, injecting fresh energy and belief into a squad that looked flat and on the way out last season.",
      "Reijnders and Ait-Nouri, in particular, are settling in brilliantly. And it’s a refreshing change of pace for City to have a natural full-back playing in, well, full-back. Ait-Nouri already looks like a serious weapon going forward, and his pace should go some way to easing those nagging concerns in transition. Doku, meanwhile, will only benefit from having someone alongside him who occupies defenders and offers an end product.",
      "We haven’t even mentioned Rodri yet. He’s very much in Like A New Signing territory, starting his first City game since last September in the 5-2 win.",
      "So far, City look like they’re absolutely nailing a crucial transfer window. We still can’t quite believe it. £31 million? FFS.",
      "The opening fixtures of the 2025/26 Premier League season will feature a number of early and potentially awkward reunions, including Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester City have seemingly landed their second signing of the summer, as transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has confirmed their agreement to sign a Premier League defender for £33.7million.",
      "Manchester City are reportedly ‘advancing’ on their second signing of the summer, after a Premier League defender gave the ‘green light’ to a move, following initial talks with his club.",

      "“I coached him in his first year as a senior player and he was a really nice boy,” Almeida told BBC Radio Manchester.",
      "“The first point is, the human values of Bryan – coachable, humble, really hungry to learn all the time. After that was potential, because he gave the first steps with us that season and he finished the season with lots of goals and passes for goals also.",
      "“He was not quick only with his feet, with his mind also. Each training session for him was like a final. In that time, he want to to learn, improve and go as far as he could. Of course he didn’t know at the time he could be as far as he is now, but his mindset – it separated him from the others.”",
      "Asked if Mbeumo can handle the pressure of playing for Manchester United, Almeida replied: “I think so. I saw him jump from us at Troyes to Brentford in the Championship and then to the Premier League. He handled it really well.",
      "“I know he is a little shy but, at the same time, he trusts himself. So he knows how strong is he, what capabilities he has, how strong he is as a player. Of course, Manchester United is a different level club, but I am trustful he will do it well.",
      "“If he is going, it is because Ruben wants him. He will fit exactly what Ruben wants as a player. Not only in offensive way but also in defensive way because Ruben demands that from the players – always.”",

      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",

      "4) Chelsea – £99.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues are already making very expensive waves.",

      "England were a lot of things at Euro 2024 but spectacular wasn’t one of them. Reaching the final and getting within five minutes of winning the trophy speaks for itself and the Three Lions, gradually, found their way after a dull start. They were never exciting. They just found their way.",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was a big part of that small improvement. He barely played in a group stage that was worryingly tame but started all four matches of a more controlled, more effective knock-out phase.",
      "Mainoo turned 20 in April. He’s proven his worth in an England shirt. He’s a Stockport-born United academy graduate with 50 Premier League appearances under his belt. That his future isn’t completely certain this summer is an indictment not only of the club, but of football’s financial governance.",
      "Specifically, it highlights the flaws in football’s financial governance frameworks. In the Premier League, profit and sustainability rules (PSR) allow clubs to make a £105m loss in any given three-year period.",
      "Because teams are on an endless quest for improvement on the pitch, players need to be bought and sold. In the PSR era, those sales are increasingly coming from the ‘Do Not Sell’ pile.",
      "Profit from sales is booked immediately and transfer fees are amortised over the lengths of the players’ contracts. Clubs sell players with value to pay down their losses and replace them with expensive successors, whose futures will be subject to the same calculations down the line.",
      "United themselves are pertinent to the PSR debate – if debts aren’t part of the calculation and clubs have to sell players against their wishes on June 30 only to buy someone more expensive on July 1 to comply with allowable losses, is it really doing its job? – but the basic fact of the matter is this: Manchester United shouldn’t be considering the sale of Mainoo in a million months of Super Sundays.",
      "And yet they might. It’s the same with Alejandro Garnacho, albeit the winger’s departure would be welcomed more positively given his penchant for bridge-burning.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho did not command transfer fees on the way in but would on the way out, and that helps United equip Ruben Amorim with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Mainoo has been forced out of the spotlight through a lot of injury and a little under-use since shining in the latter stages of the European Championship. He started exactly half of United’s Premier League matches in 2024/25, five fewer than the previous season which he began injured.",
      "He might even have been slightly forgotten by the most casual football supporters beyond the ranks of Red Devils but he’s still an exciting prospect who will be looking ahead to 2025/26 with hopes of getting his fitness back on track.",
      "There have been reports that Mainoo’s wage demands could be a factor in his club’s calculation. His contract expires in two years; a decision would be made soon at a smart club and might be made soon at United too.",
      "His coaches speak of maturity, physical strength and imagination on the ball. Even at 20, his one-on-one skills are beyond doubt, proven at the highest level. Mainoo has the mentality and ability to be a part of what United need to become.",
      "Manchester United have been a dominant commercial force in football for decades. They’ve taken their brand, their sponsorship appeal, their global fandom, and turned it into varying degrees of success.",
      "They’re a colossus – a shadow of their despised and dastardly dominance nowadays, maybe, but they’re not wiped out on the mat just yet.",
      "United don’t just buy great players. They make their own. For all their spending in the transfer market, they almost always have at least one academy product in their first team. It’s kind of a thing.",
      "Clubs up and down the Premier League are looking to their player development as the magical route to blissful spending inside PSR compliance but United, perhaps more than anyone, know the intangible benefits of bringing players through for their own line-up.",
      "Consider where United are today.",
      "They finished a few places outside the Premier League relegation zone and might have been even lower if Aston Villa hadn’t laid an egg on the last day of the season. They spurned a last-gasp chance for salvation by losing the Europa League final. They were awful.",
      "United have backed their head coach after a poor season in which the tone was set by his predecessor and a club hierarchy that leaves an enormous amount to be desired.",
      "Amorim has been anointed as the rescuer of a club that needs to become Manchester United again. The Red Devils must bounce back and they haven’t got the time or margin of error they might think.",
      "Cunha is the embodiment of one strand of that rejuvenation but they need players like Mainoo too. United’s empire was built upon them.",
      "Mainoo can control and affect the game. He travels nicely with the ball and can influence the play by doing the simple things well in the middle of the pitch with the easy confidence of a player ten years older.",
      "David Beckham won’t look enviously into his passing toolkit but Mainoo is more than just a relaxed character in midfield. What he does there is technical.",
      "“It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,” former United academy coach Paul McGuinness told Adam Bate before the European Championships.",
      "“What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes. Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it.”",
      "One of the reasons Amorim will even make it as far as the start of the new season is that he adheres to a specific system and didn’t have the players to apply it mid-season with any degree of success – it’s almost like somebody should have said something.",
      "The outrageously talented tactical analyst and tea-maker Adam Clery recently filmed a video explaining why Cunha is the perfect signing for United’s system.",
      "In his illustration of Amorim’s 3-4-3, Clery defined the four players midfield players as follows: Flying Machine on the left behind(ish) an inverted winger, Inverting Enthusiast on the right behind(ish) a creative number 10, and a Ball Winner and Plays Everywhere in the centre.",
      "His energy and tenacity contribute to a midfield’s ball-winning ability too but that Plays Anywhere role is made for Mainoo.",
      "United’s recruitment should be defined entirely by the system if they’re to climb back up the table in any meaningful way and, in Mainoo, they have a player ready to develop into one of the most important spots.",
      "One year in every four, the decisions made by players take on a different hue. 2025 is a World Cup year minus one, the year in every World Cup cycle in which players either don’t move or seek a safe bet with the attention of their international managers in mind.",
      "There’s no obvious buyer for Mainoo but PSR can do funny things and Bruno Fernandes not going to the Saudi Pro League means that the chances of the midfielder leaving are higher than zero.",
      "One of the major problems with the way football finance is governed by the Premier League and other bodies in Europe is its dehumanising impact on players. In the very worst cases, they’re shuffled around like pawns on a chessboard. They are their book value and nothing more.",
      "But if Mainoo has a say, he should stay. He needs regular football in a familiar setting and that means both staying fit and staying put.",
      "If Mainoo were to leave it would be a big deal. As a United youth made good he’s part of a rich heritage and his premature departure would shine a light on PSR’s negative impacts. He is, culturally and tactically, where he should be.",
      "Yet there’s another pattern emerging. As United falter, exiled players and discarded pieces are demonstrating an ability to perform elsewhere.",
      "Marcus Rashford was loaned to Villa and took a big step back towards his best. Jadon Sancho at least did enough at Chelsea to get a move away from Old Trafford this summer. Antony might even have played himself back into Amorim’s thinking.",
      "Scott McTominay joined Napoli last summer and a year later he’s a Serie A champion, the league’s official MVP, one of the most successful Brits in Italian football history and a beloved adopted son of Naples.",
      "That’s not bad, but it’s not for Mainoo. Not yet. United is the right spot for the 20-year-old despite last season because he’s at a club that needs him, a club he loves, and a club where he will be able to continue his development – development he still needs – without the upheaval of a transfer.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
