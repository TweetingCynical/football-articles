      "Former Manchester United star Andreas Pereira has heaped praise on current boss Marco Silva at Fulham, claiming he is the most organised coach he has played under, after working with Jose Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson. Pereira was an important player for Fulham this season, starting 25 times in the Premier League and helping them finish 11th in the table.",
      "Pereira continued to build on his impressive performances in recent years since leaving United as he registered two goals and four assists in the middle of the park.",
      "He joined United as a 16-year-old in 2011 but found first team opportunities limited. He played just 75 times across four seasons and was loaned out to Granada, Valencia, Lazio and Flamengo before joining Fulham in a permanent move in 2022.",
      "Pereira was at United in the final days of Ferguson and also played under Louis van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.",
      "Despite being coached by some of the biggest names in the game, he has been blown away by his manager Silva and hailed his preparedness for games and attention to detail.",
      "\"He's a perfectionist in making the team understand who we're playing against, the team's strengths,\" Pereira told the Daily Mail. \"He prepares our team very well, he organises everything down to the last detail, and that makes it easier for us on game day.",
      "\"I think he really has his own style. We have a plan A, a plan B. I think he might be the coach who prepares the team the most that I've ever had, even down to the last details of set pieces, even throw-ins, we know what the other team is going to do. So, I think that's a huge advantage we have.\"",
      "Silva's got Fulham promoted to the Premier League in 2022 before establishing them as a solid top flight side, with three comfortable mid-table finishes.",
      "He has since been linked with a number of top managerial roles - including Tottenham, Juventus and most recently Al Hilal.",
      "Meanwhile, Pereira has given his take on his old club's \"sad\" situation after struggling under boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "He said: \"As a fan, from the outside, it’s sad. A big club like that, seeing it the way it is, it's clearly sad. I'm used to seeing Manchester always as one of the biggest clubs in the world, always fighting at the top, fighting to be champions.",
      "\"But they're going through this phase of renewal, it's a new coach, now a new owner. So I think they'll suffer a bit, which is normal. But of course, nobody who truly likes Manchester United wants to see them in this situation.\"",

      "Things got even more farcical after the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, as United headed out to the Far East on a two-game tour. They suffered the embarrassment of losing to an ASEAN All-Stars side in Kuala Lumpur, before coming from a goal down to beat Hong Kong.",
      "Amorim has won just 16 of his first 42 competitive games in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November. His first six months at the club has been a massive disappointment and United are now braced to tear apart their squad in pursuit of improvements next season.",
      "But despite their struggles on the pitch, Amorim has won over summer signing De Ligt through his work in press conferences. The Portuguese coach said his side were “probably the worst in Manchester United history” in January before calling them “chokers” who deserved to be booed after losing in Malaysia.",
      "“I'm from Holland so I like it,” De Ligt said. “I can understand the media are in shock because normally this doesn't happen.",
      "“But I think you can also be really happy that finally someone speaks out, says what he thinks and speaks the truth. I really appreciate him in our conversations personally. It gives me a feeling I can trust him and he can trust me.”",
      "Amorim arrived at Old Trafford with a stellar reputation, having won two leagues and two cups with Sporting, but it hasn’t gone to plan at United. The 40-year-old inherited Ten Hag’s squad and has managed to connect with them, according to De Ligt, who joined for £42million from Bayern Munich last summer.",
      "“I've experienced many managers and he's one of the most easy to talk to as a player,” he said. “He's really into details. Before signing new players, first he's looking at the culture, what needs to change and what can be improved to become a better football club. From next season we will see more of that.",
      "“I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have. Maybe before, you had the best players, but you're not a team.”",
      "After getting the post-season tour done, Amorim is already looking ahead to next season. \"Of course, to spend time with my family,\" he said after the game in Hong Kong. \"But, like I said in the press conference, I am ready to start the next one.",
      "“We have a lot to do. A lot to prepare. We have to think of the squad and we are changing building. It needs to be that everything is ready for the new season.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has a big decision to make – and whichever call he makes, he will likely have to abandon his previous plans. The Manchester United captain has been handed the opportunity of a mega-money move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, but is yet to make his mind up.",
      "Fernandes stands at a crossroads in his career following a dreadful campaign for United which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose the Europa League final. After a miserable and embarrassing post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong, he now has to decide whether to stick by United, or cash in with a move to Al-Hilal.",
      "The Saudi club are reportedly willing to pay United £100million to sign the Portugal international, who they will then pay £100m over the course of his contract. His agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with the club’s executives this week and he reportedly has a week to decide, with Al-Hilal preparing for the Club World Cup.",
      "Amid the storm, Fernandes has stirred the pot by posting a Portuguese quote on Instagram which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "It will soon be crunch time for the 30-year-old midfielder, who is under contract with United until June 2027, although the club also have the option of another year. Fernandes has 98 goals and 87 assists in 290 games for United since joining them from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 and has been captain for two seasons.",
      "Al-Hilal’s interest in his services is nothing new, but United’s dreadful form and need to rejuvenate their squad suddenly makes the move a distinct possibility. Whatever he does – stay with United, or move to Saudi Arabia – it now seems unlikely that Fernandes will not follow through with a previously-stated desire to play in Brazil.",
      "He will turn 31 in September and this summer’s decision would appear to rule out a future transfer to a Brazilian side further down the line. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,” he previously said.",
      "\"It’s pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part.",
      "\"I don’t really like talking about the distant future, but it’s like I said. It’s attractive football, very interesting. The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I’m not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "The contract reportedly on offer at Al-Hilal is worth a staggering £700,000 per week and would run for three years. At the end of that, he will be approaching 34 and could instead choose to move back to his native Portugal, rather than to South America, away from his extended family.",

      "The 21-year-old enjoyed an incredible season, scoring 12 goals and assisting 19 in all competitions, and with Lyon only mustering a sixth-placed finish he is now being tipped for a move to a top European club.",
      "Manchester United were previously tipped as a destination for Cherki, after watching him score twice against them in the Europa League this season. But after missing out on European football, a move to their rivals City looks more likely.",
      "According to French outlet Foot Mercato, a move to City is \"accelerating\" for Cherki - who was voted in the Ligue 1 team of the season following his sparkling creative displays.",
      "The report states City \"appreciate\" Cherki's talents and see him as an ideal replacement for the outgoing Kevin de Bruyne. Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz was previously a big target for City, but Bayern Munich and Liverpool have now jumped to the front of the queue.",
      "Cherki's preference is to play in the No 10 role - which is where City would want to play him, it goes on. The Sky Blues are now ramping up talks with the player's team and are \"very confident\" over a deal.",
      "The boyhood Lyon star has given the thumbs up over moving to the Etihad and is excited about the prospect of playing under Guardiola, who he has already spoken to - the report claims.",
      "Cherki wants to sort his future out as quickly as possible in a deal that could earn Lyon around £34m - though he does have a release clause of £25m. Cherki has a contract at Lyon that runs until next summer",
      "He has hinted he could have played his final game for Lyon after admitting he has \"done everything I could\" for the club, saying it will \"always be in my heart\".",
      "\"I don’t know,\" he said when asked about his future. \"In any case, I know I’ve given my all for the club. I’ve done everything I could for OL, because it’s a club I’ll never forget, one that will always be in my heart.",
      "\"I stayed when a lot of players left. Today, I have no regrets. Whatever happens, I’ll give my all to the last minute for the club. I’ve only got OL on my mind, and I’d never call on anyone else.\"",
      "Cherki joined Lyon aged six and began playing for its reserve team at the age of 15. He became the first team's youngest ever scorer at 16 in 2020 and has gone on to make 185 appearances, scoring 29 times.",

The Red Devils jetted off for a 150-mile round trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong immediately after their last game of the Premier League season against Aston Villa last week.",
      "United had only just concluded a calamitous season that saw them finish 15th after 18 losses, while they also lost the Europa League final to rivals Tottenham that saw them miss out on the chance to secure Champions League football.",

      "There were claims by some players that the tour would be like a 'stag do', with some staff enjoying drinks on the 14-hour flight. On the first night there, players were allowed to head into the city of Kuala Lumpur - but sources say \"nothing crazy happened\", with players returning at a \"reasonable time\".",
      "The tour began in miserable fashion, however, as United lost 1-0 to Asean All-Stars, a team that had played one game previously - a 1-0 defeat to the Indonesia national team. Afterwards, there was \"humour\" on the team bus, despite being booed by fans.",

      "The pair remain close friends and when asked about Martinez's future, Cutler told the Sun : \"This summer is pivotal for Emi in terms of his career. He's been voted the best goalie in the world twice and there seems to be an opportunity for him this summer, with all of his options open.",
      "\"Big clubs are queuing up to speak to him and he either stays at a massive club like Villa or he goes to a truly world-class club. I don't think it's about money with Emi so I don't think he is ready to move to Saudi yet.",
      "\"If he does move it would be to a much bigger club — one of the really big-hitters like Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico... or even Manchester United. United can't offer him Champions League football but the sheer size of the club and the size of the challenge might appeal to Emi.",
      "\"Emi has the confidence required to play for a massive club like United and would feel he could affect the club in a really positive way. He would look at United and say: 'Right, I can make this place better. I can help this club get back to where it was'.\"",
      "Martinez was left in tears after Villa's final home game of the season, further fuelling speculation that he could be set to leave the club this summer.",
      "And when asked about the futures of Martinez and Leon Bailey after the game, Villa boss Unai Emery said: \"Now we are focused on the matches we are playing. It is the last match here. I don't know.",
      "\"We will see. We will see about the team, the players. They are responding and are so focused on how we are preparing each match. We have more points to play for against Manchester United. We will see how we can get better for the next season.\"",
      "Emery was then asked outright after Villa's defeat to United on the final day of the season if Martinez had played his final game for the club and he replied: \"No way.\"",

      "Matteo Darmian endured a tough time at Manchester United, though his plummeting transfer value hasn't stopped him from becoming a Champions League finalist with Inter Milan. The Italian right-back was poached from Torino in 2015 for a respectable £12.7million, and he started his United career with an impressive 1-0 Premier League win against Tottenham under Louis van Gaal.",
      "He was named the club's Player of the Month for that August. In the years to come, Darmian would prove himself as a dependable squad player, aiding in FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League victories under different managers.",
      "Although he was never quite the first name on the team sheet, he carved out a respectable top-flight career as a versatile, solid option at full-back.",
      "Darmian left Old Trafford in 2019, heading back to his homeland and Serie A with Parma. A year later, after some solid outings, he joined Inter on loan, before signing permanently at the end of that season.",
      "Since then, Darmian has proven to be an underrated piece of Inter's continuous hunt for silverware, winning a pair of Scudettos, three Italian Super Cups and two Coppa Italia trophies.",
      "Now he has the opportunity to add the Champions League to that roll of honours when Inter take on PSG on Saturday night. But he'll line up for the match with his value vastly reduced from his time with the Red Devils.",
      "Upon signing for United, Darmian was valued at £12.5m, which was similar to the fee United paid for him, according to Transfermarkt. This depreciated over time as the defender got older and failed to leave too much of a mark at Old Trafford. As a result, in 2018, he was valued at £10m.",
      "When Darmian moved to Parma at the age of 30 in 2020, his value stood at £7m. Just before his move to Inter, aged 31, this plummeted to around £3m. This sum is where the Champions League finalist's value remains at the age of 35.",
      "However, Darmian will not be the only ex-United star who is part of Inter's showpiece-reaching squad, as the Henrikh Mkhitaryan will also be present in Munich.",
      "The Red Devils purchased the Armenian in 2016 for £26m from German side Borussia Dortmund, though his estimated value at the time was £31m.",
      "Mkhitaryan's form at Old Trafford was sketchy, but he featured regularly under Jose Mourinho before moving to Arsenal as part of the deal that saw Alexis Sanchez go in the opposite direction.",
      "Upon joining the Gunners, he was valued at £29m, though this dropped to £21m the following year before he sealed a transfer to Roma. There, his value would decrease again, despite the fact he won the Conference League.",
      "By 2022, when he moved to Inter, he was valued at just £7m. As of this year, at the age of 36, the Armenian has a valuation of just £3.3m. Nevertheless, he has compiled a brilliant collection of silverware over an impressive career, winning a Scudetto, the Carabao Cup and the Europa League, among other honours.",

      "Gary Lineker has sounded a note of caution to Manchester United regarding their pursuit of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha. United endured a miserable campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "That defeat meant the club missed out on a possible Champions League spot and will not be able to offer European football next season.",
      "Despite the hefty blow that failure will have on the club's transfer budget, United head coach Ruben Amorim is still looking to bolster his squad, with Cunha emerging as a key target.",
      "Reports suggest United are prepared to activate his £62.5million buy-out clause to bring the attacker to Old Trafford. However, Lineker has signalled that Cunha might suffer from \"lacking team principles and work ethic\".",
      "\"He's an incredibly talented player. There's a slight question mark against Matheus Cunha in terms of managers,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"He's either brilliant or he can be accused occasionally of lacking team principles and work ethic.",
      "\"I think a couple of the managers at Wolves have alluded to that. Perhaps, I don't know him personally, but perhaps he can be slightly problematic.\"",
      "The 26-year-old was handed a two-game ban in December after appearing to elbow an Ipswich Town staff member before removing the same person’s glasses. In March, he was also suspended for four games after headbutting Bournemouth defender Milos Kerkez and being escorted down the tunnel during an FA Cup clash.",
      "However, Micah Richards thinks a move to United could be just what Cunha needs to put past troubles behind him. The ex-Manchester City centre-back believes that a change of scenery to a bigger club could help Cunha thrive.",
      "\"I think that 's more out of frustration,\" Richards said in response to Lineker's comments. \"I think if you're playing with–where Man United finished this season, you can't even say a better team–but ultimately a bigger club and better players, ego is put to the side a little bit.",
      "\"I think he's perfect for that system with two number 10s. He loves drifting to one side, getting on the ball, really creative and he can see a pass, so I think he'll be a good signing for Man United if they can get him.\"",
      "With Amorim downplaying the need for extensive squad renovations, it's yet unclear who else will join Cunha at the Red Devils, should he make the move.",
      "\"Without Champions League, we don't need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way,\" Amorim said during United's post-season tour. \"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules.",
      "\"We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that. It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\""

      "When Manchester United players got wind that a post-season tour was a certainty, a delegation on behalf of the first team squad approached the football leadership team to express their dismay.",
      "One senior player complained that his family holiday, booked for the half-term week after the season ended, would have to be cancelled. Another suggested that players would try to cry off and avoid a 14,150-mile round trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong.",
      "In response to that warning, United brought the departure time of their outbound flight forward to Sunday evening, hours after the final game of the season against Aston Villa. That reduced the possibility of any last-minute withdrawals. Injured trio Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee and Luke Shaw all boarded the plane to Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Shaw's parents, partner and children boarded a plane for Dubai that night. Jonny Evans's wife, Helen, children and extended family were on the same flight. The WAGs' spouses might have wished they could join them.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen are both leaving United and were absent from the tour, with personal reasons cited. Lindelof's wife, Maja, is due to give birth to their third child and Eriksen is about to get married to his long-time partner Sabrina Kvist Jensen.",
      "Well-placed sources have said the United players were \"fuming\" to be in Asia after a 60-game season. They are unlikely to generate any sympathy after a trophyless campaign and 15th-placed finish. United did get to lift a cup in Hong Kong, one so undervalued a press officer carried it back to the dressing room.",
      "Some United sources assured the mood was better than expected after last week's demoralising Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Every player conducted the obligatory post-match meet-and-greets in the Hong Kong National Stadium on Friday evening, including a moody Alejandro Garnacho, this time minus his sunglasses.",
      "United's six days away from home Manchester were effectively condensed into four. Tuesday was teeming with commercial player appearances, with some lasting two hours. Players gladhanded guests on behalf of club sponsors Adidas, Tezos and Snapdragon, among others.",
      "Wednesday marked the now infamous Maybank-sponsored open-top bus journey that Zirkzee, De Ligt and Ayden Heaven were on board for. A United source insists it was not arranged with the intention of parading the Europa League trophy around Kuala Lumpur and that it was billed as a bus tour.",
      "In United's view, this was an example of the distinction between engagement with local fans and overseas fans. The bus ride was lapped up by locals. Back home, it was a source of embarrassment for those still reeling from the Bilbao blow.",
      "Adidas hosted a poolside party on the deck of the W Hotel after the defeat to the ASEAN All Stars on Wednesday evening. Several guests attended the nocturnal gathering and admired the sight of the glistening Petronas Twin Towers in the background.",
      "There was more commercial activity on Friday ahead of the second friendly with a Hong Kong XI. United held more meet-and-greets following their arrival in Hong Kong on Thursday, with a minor training session held in the rain. Mason Mount and Altay Bayindir featured after their non-appearances in Malaysia.",
      "Three of their teammates were in India. Andre Onana, Harry Maguire and Diogo Dalot left the Bukit Jalil National Stadium at half-time on Wednesday to board a private jet to Mumbai. Despite intense commercial activities planned, the trio were happy to volunteer as they got to return home earlier.",
      "After United were beaten by the ASEAN All Stars, there was gallows humour on the team bus back to the W Hotel. The booing at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium had not gone unnoticed by players and staff. Ruben Amorim reminded the media in Hong Kong there had been loud cheering, too.",
      "There were some farcical post-match scenes in Kuala Lumpur. United had to collect silver medals for the second Wednesday running, but the procession was delayed. The referee and linesmen had returned to their dressing room but had to be called back out to receive their medals, so United were forced to endure an inordinate wait.",
      "A United player half-joked the post-season tour would be \"like a stag do\". Some players were tempted to venture out beyond the house arrest of the team hotel but were advised by a senior player to stay in.",
      "United staff let their hair down on the trip. Some enjoyed drinks on the 14-hour flight to Kuala Lumpur while players had permission to head out into Kuala Lumpur on their first night in the Malaysian capital, flanked by security. A source said nothing \"crazy\" happened.",
      "Sources say the players returned at a reasonable time. United did not bother adjusting to the seven-hour time zone difference as training and commercial obligations were always held in the afternoons and evenings.",
      "Club sources acknowledged the trip was not as disciplined as a pre-season tour and that players could be more frivolous. Garnacho, Amad and Heaven headed out on e-scooters that had to be paid for by clued-up locals. Zirkzee was not taken by the room service on offer at the W Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, so headed across the road for some Thai take-out, again accompanied by a security guard.",
      "On the eighth floor of United's hotel in Kuala Lumpur there was a vending machine that dispensed mini bottles of Moet & Chandon champagne, priced at £40. If any United representative was of that persuasion it would have been to drown their sorrows after a shocking season.",
      "Happy faces were put on for signing sessions yet United players still made headlines with some explicit gestures. Amad raised his middle finger to fans he claimed were abusing his mother. Garnacho has done it multiple times without provocation. The players were advised to stop making the offensive gesture.",
      "Those on the tour have found Garnacho to be surly. He promised the All Stars forward Sergio Aguero that he would give him his shirt after the game. Instead, Garnacho blanked Aguero and United staff had to arrange for a shirt to be gifted to the Malaysian as a memento. It was noticeable in Hong Kong how carefully some of United's staff shadowed Garnacho as he signed shirts and posed for pictures, never breaking into a smile.",
      "Garnacho was one of the last to board the team bus after the All Stars defeat. With midnight looming, he donned sunglasses and ignored requests in the mixed zone. An eyewitness said he removed the shades almost immediately after he walked past the packed pen and surmised they were donned at the behest of personal sponsors. It still projected a brattish attitude.",
      "Beyond some of the imagery that has emerged on social media, Garnacho also stuck his middle finger up at one of the United photographers after the All Stars match. Amorim started to chuckle when the remote possibility of Garnacho staying was raised at a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday.",
      "Amorim cheerfully admitted to a colleague how exhausting the post-season tour had been, especially in the humidity of Malaysia. The Portuguese will oversee his first pre-season tour with United in July, a condensed and relatively low-key return to the United States, spent primarily in Chicago.",
      "The prestige of the United manager's role has dawned on him. \"It's more than a coach,\" Amorim admitted. \"On this tour, I had a small meeting with the Prime Minister of Malaysia.",
      "\"You have to improve as a person, as a leader, you have to control the momentum. Sometimes after games you see I'm really frustrated, I'm trying to control that. The only thing I want is to improve the team and have results, when you have results you can manage the team so much easier.\"",
      "It would be easier if Bruno Fernandes stayed but the United captain is giving serious consideration to an approach from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal. Figures at United empathise with Fernandes, who has not shied from the subject with confidants. They would not blame him if he were to up sticks after five-and-a-half years of underachievement with United. Fernandes has not formally told United he wants to leave.",
      "There is understandable concern at the prospect of United minus Fernandes. His leadership has been apparent even over the past few days in Asia, where he bought staff drinks at the hotel bar and was generous with post-match autograph requests from Malaysian fans who had crammed into the mixed zone. It was the same in Hong Kong. Fernandes was ushered to the team coach by three secruity guards.",
      "United's stay in Hong Kong was so whistlestop that they were barely in the country for 36 hours. After an early-morning flight, the team spent around an hour at their second W Hotel to freshen up and have lunch. Then it was back on the bus to the Hong Kong Stadium for training and more meet-and-greets.",
      "With ample time to reflect on their worst season in 51 years, some within the United camp are already at the end of their tether with many in the squad. The widespread consensus is that the players do not play to their maximum in every match, as evidenced by the contrast in their Europa League and Premier League form.",
      "During the open training session in Kuala Lumpur, United's back-to-front attacks were constructed at a glacial pace. One of the inflatable mannequins quickly deflated.",
      "That is how the players would feel if they have to embark on another post-season trek."

      "Manchester United brought their post-season tour to an end with a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong at the Hong Kong Stadium on Friday.",
      "After trailing 1-0 at half-time, United flipped the game on its head in the second half via a brace from Chido Obi and a late header from Ayden Heaven.",
      "It marked a victorious conclusion to a 67-game season that everyone associated with United will be keen to forget about as quickly as possible.",
      "With the tour now wrapped up and the season officially done and dusted, full focus switches to the summer transfer window and the start of next season. But following the conclusion of the tour of Asia, which saw United visit Malaysia before travelling to Hong Kong, MEN Sport has picked out four post-tour talking points:",
      "After being informed by Ruben Amorim prior to last Sunday's Premier League finale against Aston Villa at Old Trafford that he will be free to leave the club this summer, the last thing Alejandro Garnacho would have wanted is to travel to Asia on a post-season tour and participate in two meaningless friendlies.",
      "After starting the 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur on the bench, Garnacho was named in the starting XI for the win over Hong Kong. Despite earning cheers from supporters every time he touched the ball and attempting to be inventive when he had possession, his mannerisms off the pitch were not of somebody in a good mood.",
      "United staff shadowed him carefully during a signing session in Hong Kong, during which he never broke into a smile. He also ignored requests to speak to journalists in the mixed zone after the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars, walking straight through, donning dark sunglasses as midnight approached.",
      "The biggest positive of the post-season tour by a country mile was Obi claiming his first goals for United's first-team, netting a smart brace in the win in Hong Kong. For his first goal, he swivelled inside the box and fired a clinical left-footed shot into the back of the net.",
      "His second goal was all about his intelligent movement and reading of the game. Recognising Mason Mount, who also impressed in the second half against Hong Kong, was about to float a ball into the box, the young Dane was quick to make a run across his man and glance a header into the bottom corner.",
      "Obi, in that move alone, produced much better movement inside the box than fellow countryman Rasmus Hojlund did at any point across his two starts on tour. Hojlund's box movement is one of his biggest flaws.",
      "Obi, meanwhile, looked razor-sharp against Hong Kong and his two goals, despite not being competitive strikes, will have done him the world of good. With a full pre-season under his belt, he could get a more prominent role in the squad next season.",
      "The main purpose of United's trip to Asia may have been for commercial reasons, with the six-day trip expected to bank them somewhere between £8million and £10m, but that was never going to create headlines. Instead, transfer talk was always going to do fill column inches.",
      "After Amorim, sitting alongside Mount at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, said United \"cannot do much\" in this summer's window, Omar Berrada, the following day, said United will have to be \"prudent\" in their attempts to strengthen the squad ahead of next season.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say we've been planning for many months now,\" Berrada told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios. Now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve. So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben have been in talks for many months. And now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent. But at the same time, with ambition.\"",
      "With that in mind, United are unlikely to be able to attack the transfer window as much as they would have liked. Instead, as a result of missing out on the improved revenue streams that would have come with securing Champions League qualification, they will have to be that little be wiser and shrewder.",
      "One of the biggest positives United have had to shout about this calendar year have been the performances of January recruit Heaven. Despite only making six competitive appearances before the end of the season and two on the tour, the 18-year-old defender has not put a foot wrong since arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "He has a solid reading of the game, his positional awareness is spot on and his ability on the ball is excellent. As a left-footer, he could find himself ahead of Lisandro Martinez in the race to start on the left of the back-three come the end of next season.",
      "Although Hong Kong did not provide the sternest test United have ever faced, Heaven, following his half-time introduction, was able to progress the ball really well from deep areas and help his teammates get up the pitch. Those ball-playing credentials in a centre-back and becoming more and more important in the modern game, and United appear to have uncovered a gem."

      "Ruben Amorim is now just hours away from embarking on his first summer transfer window as Manchester United head coach.",
      "The window will initially open on Sunday before briefly closing again on Tuesday, June 10. The window is opening earlier than usual due to an exceptional registration period relating to the FIFA Club World Cup taking place this summer.",
      "The window will then reopen on Monday, June 16 until the 7pm deadline on Monday, September 1, meaning clubs will have plenty of time to get deals over the line and their squads in order for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "For United, a summer transfer window has never felt so important. The club experienced its worst campaign in 51 years this season and much-needed changes are required across the board.",
      "However, as a result of missing out on European qualification for next term, United will not be able to make as many alterations as they would have been able to had they made it into the Champions League. Amorim admitted this week United \"cannot do much\".",
      "It means player sales, which could include the departures of Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes, could dictate what United are capable of. They want to strengthen their attack as a priority and are already well on their way to doing so.",
      "Barring any late hiccups, Wolves star Matheus Cunha will become their first signing of the summer. United remain in talks with the Midlands outfit over how to structure the payment of his £62.5million release clause.",
      "If and when United get that deal over the line, he is expected to slot straight into Amorim's first-choice XI and occupy the left-sided No.10 spot. He is well-versed playing that role in a three-at-the-back formation.",
      "United had also earmarked Ipswich Town ace Liam Delap as their priority target to strengthen the No.9 position. United desperately need a striker this summer and Delap was an attainable option at £30m.",
      "However, he is now on the cusp of joining Chelsea, meaning United's search for a striker is going to have to lead them elsewhere.",
      "Despite scoring 12 goals for a relegated side this season, Delap is still raw and unproven. United, instead, need a more established figure that can offer a greater guarantee of goals.",
      "Napoli's Victor Osimhen would be the ideal option for United. Napoli are keen to offload him as quickly as possible this summer after his loan spell at Galatasaray, which saw him score 36 goals, and he has a proven record of scoring goals just about everywhere he has been.",
      "Of course, the elephant in the room is that United cannot offer any prospective signings European football for next season. Osimhen would be a guaranteed starter and the prospect of achieving his dream of playing in the Premier League could convince him to make the move.",
      "Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked with United over the past week or so and he would be another statement signing. He scored 20 Premier League goals this season and is going to command plenty of interest this summer.",
      "He would be a perfect fit for United's front-three, operating as the right-sided No.10. He also has the versatility that Amorim wants in his players.",
      "With strengthening the attack having to take priority this summer, the rest of United's squad may largely remain unchanged. Player sales, as already documented, will dictate what is available.",
      "There are cases for United to strengthen in the centre of midfield and in goal. However, United are reasonably well-stocked in other areas, meaning recruitment in lesser priority positions may have to wait beyond this summer.",
      "But if Fernandes is sold for the mooted £100m fee that Al-Hilal are reportedly ready to pay, more could be achievable. United, though, should be attempting to keep the Portuguese international amid his importance to the team.",
      "Starting XI: Onana; Yoro, Maguire, Heaven; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Osimhen.",

      "De Ligt: \"Yeah, it's going better. It's still not over yet obviously, otherwise I would be on the pitch yesterday. But yeah, it's getting a little bit better. There's some things that have to... it's not one thing, it's multiple things that have to come together. So I think it's good that the season almost ends and hopefully soon I can be back on the pitch and for pre-season back fit.",
      "You got injured in the Forest game. Was it a recurrence or a different injury?",
      "\"No, it was the Forest game, the Brentford game. It’s all... The body is not just one thing and it's all together.\"",
      "How is it being offered over here in this environment?",
      "\"Yeah, I mean I wouldn't say it's ideal, obviously, but it's the way it is. It's for the players to accept the things how they are. Also here I can do the job. The facilities are really good. The physios are here with us, so I'm not complaining about that.\"",
      "What will you do when you go home? Do you keep going to Carrington for treatment or will you go back to Holland? How will that work?",
      "\"Yeah, that's still something we have to discuss. Obviously it has been a really long season and the last one-and-a-half month I didn't play, but still I think everybody needs a holiday. But as I said, I think tomorrow, two days from now, we go back to Carrington and then we'll discuss what's the best plan.\"",
      "I was surprised when I put your age in, how young you are. Because I always think how young you were when you captained Ajax to that Champions League semi-final. It's almost kind of, not defining for your career, but it's a big focus point on your career. When we were saying that obviously next season Manchester United are not going to have European football and that will be the first time, I would imagine in your career that you've not experienced that?",
      "\"Well, I experienced it once. It was actually also after a Europa League final against United (in 2017), and the season after we reached the semi-final of the Champions League. So, let's keep that! On a serious note, I've been used to playing in the Champions League for my whole career, more or less. This season was the Europa League, but it was also really, really nice and obviously we reached the final and unfortunately we couldn't win it. Next season will be different with less games. I think more time to prepare for the games, so hopefully we can get the benefits from that.\"",
      "How much does that extra time help? Because Ruben's talked about it quite a lot. He came in November when the schedule was really packed. But looking forward to next year, three midweeks, that's more time out on the grass, isn't it?",
      "\"Yeah, I think obviously every player wants to play as many games as possible. So, it will be different. But I think for the manager, as you said, there's more time to train, more time also to have an intensive tactical session, because obviously you can still train tactical if you play a lot of games but you cannot put the intensity in because you're playing every two days a game. So, I think in that way, as the manager said, it could be an advantage and hopefully we can exploit that.\"",
      "Will you be watching the Champions League? Do you watch a lot of football or will it just be kind of you switch off from it?",
      "\"Well, I watched a lot of football when I was younger. The last years I lived it less because I have been busy and the football is changing a bit. But the big games I still watch, I still like, I still watch.\"",
      "Do you think football is becoming less exciting? There was a quote from Bielsa that it's becoming more of a business than a sport...",
      "\"Yeah, just speaking from my point of view, obviously I'm now 25. So, obviously everything that is from the past, I make it nicer than it was. But for me, football before was more interesting to watch. I think now it's what you said, it's a little bit more business, it's a little bit more about results and maybe the flair or the crazy actions where people are going for the statement becomes less and less. So I think that's the development now of football and let's see how it goes, if it stays or if it's changing. I don't know.\"",
      "When you signed for United, it felt like it was a long time coming because I'm sure you remember playing in Edwin van der Sar's testimonial against Manchester United's junior side and Jose Mourinho seemed to be really interested in you as well. One of the heads of the academy a few years ago also said that he really wanted to bring you to United. Do you remember any of those conversations when you were younger at all of United's interest?",
      "\"To be fair, before that summer I never really have spoken to United. I knew that in the summer I went to Juventus (in 2019), that United had a kind of interest, but I think they went for 'H' (Harry Maguire). So for me at that stage, the Premier League was a maybe, I said it also on interview, the Premier League is the biggest league in the world, the quickest league in the world and I felt at that point I was ready, but for my development it could have been better to go to another league a step above, but not the highest. It was never really an option for me, but that summer it was for the first time really an option.\"",
      "Can you tell me, there's been a lot of talk this season because it's not been a great season, about the pressure of playing for Manchester United and the weight of the shirt, which we tend to talk more about England, but it is a kind of factor with United. You've played for some of the biggest clubs, clearly Ajax are enormous in Holland, Bayern in Germany, Juventus in Italy. Is there a difference in pressure or is it just because you haven't won enough matches?",
      "\"I think it's the last [thing] as, what you said, the pressure is all the same. You need to win. I've been at Ajax, my first team, and there were moments where we were not playing good and they were also cynical. They were saying we scored, let's say we were 3-0 behind in the last minute, we scored 3-1, so we're still losing and they said 10, 10, 10, sarcastic. I'm used to that kind of thing.",
      "\"But I think the biggest difference right now is that this season was such below expectations that the pressure feels much more on you, especially because you don't get much joy because you don't win many games. It feels even more and more and more. I think that's what a lot of players are experiencing this season. As you can see, it also can change real quick, like you saw in the Europa League, how the emotions were also with the players and together with the fans. That's something that I think can be really tough, but it can also be amazing. I think hopefully next season we can make it amazing.\"",
      "What do you think has got to change next season specifically, not to be another below-par performance?",
      "\"I think what I'm experiencing now is what I like to see and that is what the manager is doing right now. I'm not speaking into details, but I have a feeling he's really looking at the spots. I'm not speaking about players only, but also about the whole culture and the way we are working at the club. I think he's really into details. Before signing new players, before signing new things, he's first looking at what is the culture, what needs to change, what can improve to become a better football club. I think from next season we will see more of that.\"",
      "How is he communicating that to you, or is it just something you've noticed yourself?",
      "\"I've got a really good relationship with him, to be fair. He's really open also with me, so it's really nice to speak with him. Obviously, I've experienced many managers. He's one of the managers who is the most easy to talk to as a player. In the same way, you can also see what he's doing, what he wants to do with the team. I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, especially, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have.",
      "\"Maybe like before, you were united with the best players, but you're not a team. I think that's something that's really positive. Hopefully, next season, from the pre-season, we can work really strong on that because we have a lot of time.\"",
      "Do you think that's why he is so harsh with his words sometimes? Last night (Wednesday), the friendly crowd booed at the end. Does that work for you? Could it be too much sometimes?",
      "\"I'm from Holland so I like it! I can understand that for the media, they're in shock because they're like, normally this doesn't happen. But I think you can also, as a media, be really happy that finally someone speaks out and speaks out what he thinks and speaks the truth instead of going around and stuff like that. I really appreciate him in our conversations personally, how we speak. That gives me a feeling that I can trust him and he can trust me.\"",
      "How has it been with the back three/back two switch? I don't know how much you played that in your career previously. You must have done. What's that been like, that sort of progression and how can it be better next season? Because it feels like that's essential to having the formation be an attacking one rather than a back five almost.",
      "\"I think it's a discussion that comes up a lot, obviously. It's always like, oh, three in the back, four in the back. I think if you really analyse our games, it's not that static. It's in a way that we are always defending in a three, always in a four. I think in the build-up, all the European teams, the big European teams play with a three in the back. They switch the midfielder in the back or a full-back who comes back. So it's always in a three.",
      "\"But then maybe the difference is that sometimes, how do you... what kind of players do you put in certain positions? How do you want to play? You can play with five in the back or you can play with three in the back. It's completely different. I think that's something that we will see maybe a little bit more from us next season. Hopefully we can give also the fans a little bit more joy also in the way of playing and also, especially ourselves also, in showing what we can do.\"",
      "For you in particular, having played for Erik at Ajax, was it a drastic difference for you going from playing under him and then changing to Ruben?",
      "\"Well, I've experienced a lot of managers in my career already. So I think I can say that I adapted quite well to the new manager. Obviously for me, the position, it changes but it's not that much. It's more like right centre back with Erik or it's like right centre back in the middle of a three. Obviously it's a difference but it's manageable. So yeah, obviously when you have a new manager, it's always finding out how he works, what he wants and as I said, we have a good relationship. so it was quite easy for me.: So yeah, it was okay. It was nice.\"",
      "So how important, given you lost the final and what happens this season, how important is it to make a good start? Because you talk about pressure, you can really do without that or coming back on you straight away next season?",
      "\"Yeah, but that's for every club. I mean, every club it's important to start well, to start strong. As we said, we have a really long pre-season now to prepare us for the new league. So yeah, that will be really important and obviously, especially after this season, it's also for us, I think an obligation to defend.\"",
      "I saw you singing with gusto the 'Glory Glory Man United' song. But you seem to take that responsibility seriously at that level, having been a captain at such a young age. What do you put into that? What kind of value do you think that gives players that connection with the fans?",
      "\"No, obviously really important. I mean, we know we had a difficult season this season. so from the outside it's really easy to say, oh, what are they doing now? They go on the bus and stuff like that. But you obviously have to deal also with millions of fans in Asia who are probably also for the club really important, for us as players also really important and obviously don't see us as often as the people from Manchester or from England. So that's why these trips are so important for us and for them. It's so valuable because it really gives you a connection for us to see how they view us but also for them to see us close. So I think even if it's after a season like this, it's not the easiest trip but it's so nice for us to show our love also to the fans. So yeah, it's good.",
      "And the next open-top bus parade (after his appearance on one in Kuala Lumpur) will be with a trophy?",
      "\"Yeah, that would be nice!\""

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, May 31.",
      "United's transfer business doesn't appear to be stopping. After agreeing a deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha, Ruben Amorim's side are continuing to be linked with more attackers to bolster the current crop.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, who is set to join Chelsea for £30million, United are back to square one in their hunt for a new centre-forward. Napoli's Victor Osimhen and Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director, Matt Hargreaves, is in Naples to try and thrash out a deal. Osimhen will likely want to get his business done sooner rather than later, considering how his high-profile switch, last summer, fell through on deadline day.",
      "Sporting's Gyokeres has also been linked to United, owing to his close relationship with Amorim. However, it appears the club are in a long queue for him which now looks to include Liverpool.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is also a target for United. However, any more incomings after a striker aren't expected to be pursued until funds are raised through player sales. Unfortunately, that could mean Bruno Fernandes leaves the club amid ongoing links to the lucrative Saudi Pro League.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "That is it for our live Manchester United transfer news coverage on Saturday, May 31.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest on Sunday when the transfer window OPENS.",
      "Now then, according to German outlet Kicker (via Mundo Deportivo) have claimed that Erik ten Hag wants to bring Antony to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Obviously, Ten Hag brought Antony to United and after arriving in Leverkusen, could bring him to Germany.",
      "Man United are one of the clubs interested in former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, accoridng to reports.",
      "Graeme Bailey has reported that they have been approached by the forward's entourage a possible move back to England. Abraham spent this season on loan at AC Milan, scoring 10 goals.",
      "West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have also all shown interest.",
      "Besiktas are 'making a bold' move to attempt to sign Manchester United midfielder Casemiro this summer, according to Fanatik.",
      "Casemiro has a contract at United until summer 2026, meaning he could be available at a cut-price deal. It's added that his market value is estimated to be around £8.4million.",
      "Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, now at Besiktas, is keen to strengthen his squad following an impressive end to the season.",
      "According to A Bola in Portugal, Ruben Amorim has Sporting CP attacking midfielder Pedro Goncalves in his summer plans, with interest expected to increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",
      "It's reported that United are considering the Sporting star and weighing up the possibility of moving forward with an offer for Amorim's former player.",
      "Sporting, however, insist that they won't consider offers for Goncalves under his £67million release clause and want to keep him at the club beyond this summer.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal that they need to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join ahead of the Club World Cup next month.",
      "Journalist Graeme Bailey told United In Focus: \"Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest. I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "\"They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out. The Pro League's record transfer was €90m for Neymar, they don't often spend huge amounts but they are also willing to pay £100million for Bruno.",
      "\"They didn't get their top target for this summer in the shape of Mo Salah, but Bruno could be the big one.",
      "\"Al Hilal want to win the Club World Cup, and if they can bag Inzaghi, Ronaldo and Bruno... that would be some statement. United have told Bruno he isn't going... but 100m would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.\"",
      "Manchester United want to sign Brighton & Hove Albion winger Yankuba Minteh and are keen to sign him in a blockbuster summer deal, according to Stretty News.",
      "Minteh has joined Rayan Cherki and Bryan Mbeumo on United's shortlist to strengthen their attack, but it appears that the Brighton man has emerged as a more realistic option.",
      "The 20-year-old Gambian tormented United in Brighton's 3-1 win at Old Trafford in January, scoring one and providing one assist, and that performance has not gone unnoticed.",
      "Manchester United are eager for Antony to depart the club this summer with Real Betis keen to make his loan move permanent but financial constraints pose a significant challenge.",
      "Following Wednesday night's UEFA Conference League final defeat to Chelsea, the La Liga side reportedly cannot meet United's £40million asking price. Antony's hefty weekly wage of £200,000 could also prove problematic, despite the Brazilian's enjoying his time in Seville.",
      "A report in Marca suggests that Betis may consider part-ownership of Antony in an unusual move that would see United retain some interest. Discussions between the clubs are set to take place over the next few days to explore potential agreements.",
      "A more plausible scenario might be for Betis to agree another loan for Antony while covering a substantial portion of his wages. Antony, who cost United £86m, has netted nine goals in 26 matches since joining Betis midway through the season.",
      "Matheus Cunha is still expected to become a Manchester United player, despite the delay surrounding his proposed summer move to Old Trafford, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha to Man Utd is a here we go,\" Romano told his YouTube channel. \"Matheus Cunha to Manchester United is a done deal. But many of you keep asking me where is Matheus Cunha? In the sense that there is no medical, no deal signed, no official statement, no formal steps.",
      "\"My understanding is it's just about waiting for the Visa.",
      "\"So Cunha is waiting for Visa [to be approved] and meanwhile Man Utd are preparing everything for the medical and contract signing, then for the sure the formal steps will be coordinated with the Brazilian national team staff because then Cunha will join the Brazilian national team with Carlo Ancelotti (on international duty).",
      "\"So [Man Utd] are working on the location [for the medical], working on every single step including the Visa, but Matheus Cunha will be a Manchester United player, don't worry about that.\"",
      "Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres are two of Europe's most in-demand strikers right now and Manchester United continue to be linked with both.",
      "United are in desperate need of a reliable goal-scorer this summer, having not had one since Marcus Rashford netted 30 goals in 2022/2023 under Erik ten Hag. Cristiano Ronaldo was United's last great striker in that regard with 24 goals in 2021/2022.",
      "It's why Osimhen and Gyokeres are so, so appealing. There's a sense that signing either player would fix a huge number of problems at M16 and perhaps the biggest one of them all.",

      "United have identified Cunha as a primary target this summer, as they look to improve their attack under Amorim.

      "What happens next will be pivotal to United's 2025/26 campaign - a season where the Reds' status as one of Europe's leading clubs is under threat. That's not to say they won't remain a big club, but after finishing so low in the top-flight, teams like Newcastle and Chelsea, never mind Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City, are becoming more fashionable to support for younger fans across the globe.",
      "It's why selling Fernandes is such a bad idea after the season United have had. Imagine where they would have been without him? It's not a stretch to suggest that they could have been looking over their shoulders at the Premier League's bottom three.",

      "Sporting’s position is reportedly that he can only leave if his €80m (£67m) release clause is triggered. It is said that the Portuguese champions want to renew his contract, but they will wait to see if there could be any movements in the upcoming summer transfer window.",

      "Obi currently wears the No.56 shirt for United, which is the same number which was handed to him when he first arrived at Old Trafford and featured for the first-team. This summer could be the time that United put their faith in the striker and give him a new number for the upcoming season.",

If United do decide to give Obi a new number there are several options available. The No.19 is currently vacant at United, having previously been worn by Raphael Varane until his departure in the summer of 2024. No.14 is also set to be available once Christian Eriksen leaves as a free agent.",

      "As he now prepares to join up with the Sweden national team, coach Jon Dahl Tomasson was inevitably asked whether he could offer any hints about the player's future.",
      "\"Of course, I'm not going to say,\" he said when asked about which club Gyokeres should join. \"Otherwise there would be an explosion. There will definitely be players changing clubs.",
      "\"We know that every year. If we look at each player, the right choice must be made before heading to a certain club. We also have family and we have to keep that in mind. It's not easy. At the end of the day, that is football.\"",

      "According to Spanish newspaper Marca, Betis are expected to submit another loan offer for Antony.",
      "However, United are keen to recoup a significant portion of the £82 million they spent on him in 2022. The La Liga club is also reportedly considering purchasing a share of Antony’s rights, the report adds.",
      "Speaking of the Brazilian, Betis boss Manuel Pellegrini said: \"Antony is a very good player. I am absolutely sure that this is a huge time he had in Betis to continue improving his career.\"",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are keen to sell Antony permanently this summer to drum up funds for Ruben Amorim's rebuild project.",
      "According to BILD, Manchester United have 'earmarked' Sesko as a potential reinforcement for their attack this summer.",
      "This comes after their reported failure to land Liam Delap, who is reportedly favouring a move to Chelsea. The report also states that United chief Omar Berrada has personally endorsed the move for the 21-year-old after conducting several individual assessments of the striker’s progress.",
      "Berrada is even believed to have watched Šeško in action during RB Leipzig’s recent 3-2 win over Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Sesko is also attracting interest from Arsenal."

      "Besiktas are 'making a bold' move to attempt to sign Manchester United midfielder Casemiro this summer, according to the latest reports. Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to strengthen his squad following an impressive end to the season.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed as Besiktas' new head coach in January - his first managerial role since he left United back in November 2021. The Norwegian got off to a flying start, winning seven of his opening nine matches in charge. Although Besiktas stuttered in March, they regained their form and finished fourth in Super Lig, enough to secure Europa League qualification.",
      "During his time at Besiktas so far, Solskjaer has won 11 and drawn four of his 21 matches in charge and he is expected to be backed in the summer transfer window, as they look to mount a title charge next season.",
      "According to Turkish outlet Fanatik, Casemiro has been identified as a target and Besiktas are said to be keen on bringing the defensive midfielder to Vodafone Park.",
      "Casemiro has a contract at United until summer 2026, meaning he could be available at a cut-price deal. It's added that his market value is estimated to be around £8.4million.",
      "This isn't the first time Besiktas have been linked with a move for Casemiro. They were tipped to sign the Brazilian in January, but he stayed at Old Trafford and has since been an important member of the United side.",
      "In fact, the 33-year-old started in each of United's knockout matches en route to the Europa League final. He formed a solid partnership alongside Manuel Ugarte and scored in each leg against Athletic Club de Bilbao in the semi-final. Across the season, Casemiro finished on 42 appearances, netting five times and providing three assists.",
      "When asked about Casemiro's improved performances earlier this month, Amorim said: \"He improved a lot also, you can see [that] not in the way he plays but the way he runs, and you can see it. We have the data to show he worked really, really hard. He's a very good example. But he was not playing.",
      "\"Even Toby [Collyer] sometimes was playing in front of him. And now it's hard to take Casemiro [out]. So it's a lesson for all the players in Manchester United: no matter what the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high.",

      "Manchester United will find themselves having a big decision to make if Al-Hilal submit a big-money offer for captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "It is understood the United ace is considering a move to the Saudi Arabian club amid suggestions they could table a £100million bid for his signature. They are keen to get on with a deal as quickly as possible so that Fernandes can feature at the upcoming Club World Cup.",
      "United have refused to rule out the prospect of selling anyone in this summer's transfer window, meaning Fernandes could be offloaded if the club receives an offer that is too good to turn down, despite chief executive Omar Berrada admitting earlier this year nobody will be sold purely for financial purposes.",
      "If United lost a player as important and as influential as Fernandes, he would leave a gaping hole in need of filling. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at three ways United could line-up if they were to say farewell to their much-loved talisman:",
      "Like Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo is not yet assured of his United future. He found himself in and out of the team in the second half of the season and regularly flittered between the centre of midfield and one of the two No.10 spots, meaning his long-term position in Ruben Amorim's plans is yet to be determined.",
      "Most United supporters believe Amorim underused Mainoo in the second half of the season, failing to make the most of his talent. But there is no denying his performances, albeit impacted by injury, were not as eye-catching as they were in 2023/24.",
      "A player as talented as Mainoo ought to be central to United's future plans, and he can force his way into a position that makes him a key figure.",
      "By no means a direct comparison to Fernandes, he could operate from the centre of midfield and next to Manuel Ugarte, with the onus on the latter to provide the defensive nous and control that allows Mainoo to play the progressive, forward-thinking game he is capable of.",
      "Fernandes, of course, is equally capable of playing as both a No.8 and as a No.10. If Amorim views his long-term role as one of the two playmakers, United are already working on trying to sign someone who can pick up that baton in Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have agreed to pay his £62.5m release clause and are now in talks with Wolves over the structure of the payments. He is expected to be United's first summer signing and become Amorim's first-choice left-sided No.10, meaning if Fernandes is to stay, he could find himself automatically operating as a No.8.",
      "It would then be a toss up between Mason Mount and Amad to occupy the other No.10 berth. Both players are well thought of by Amorim and will equally believe they are worthy of a starting berth, but Amad is also capable of playing as a right wing-back.",
      "If both Amad and Mount start, Amorim may be forced to going slightly more defensive in the centre of midfield, requiring him to task Casemiro and Ugarte with sitting deep and soaking up counter-attacks and sniffing out any danger.",
      "The prospect of United banking £100m for Fernandes, who will turn 31 in September, would open up avenues of opportunity for them to explore this summer. It is no secret United want to sharpen their attack by signing a goalscorer alongside Cunha.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction United's hunt for a goal-getter will head in. However, links connecting them with the likes of Victor Osimhen of Napoli and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres are unlikely to go away soon.",
      "If United can fund a move for a striker of that ilk, they have to try everything possible to land one. Never have United been so desperate for a proven goal-getter.",
      "If, for example, United are lucky enough to sign Osimhen, he will automatically replace Rasmus Hojlund as the starting striker. Depending on how far their budget stretches, Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked with a move to M16, meaning he would complete a star-studded, new-look attack."

      "\"Even during such a tough season, the professionalism and dedication of the players and staff never wavered and I know there will be better times ahead.",
      "\"I want to thank Jason, Ruben and Erik for the opportunities they gave me, and wish everyone at the club the best of luck for the future.”",
      "Wilcox added: \"Andreas has been a valued member of our men’s first team coaching set-up over the past year and we are grateful for his significant contribution. He leaves with our thanks and best wishes for the next stage of his career.\""

      "Just five minutes into the second 45, Obi swivelled inside the penalty area and crashed a low drive into the bottom corner. It was a clinical finish and it offered a further insight into what he is capable of.",
      "He got himself on the scoresheet again with less than ten minutes left on the clock, heading in Mason Mount's excellent delivery. The youngster timed his run across his marker to perfection and glanced his header into the far corner.",

      "Chido Obi, the more frugal and callow Danish striker signing by United, clinically claimed his maiden goal for the first team. Obi replaced Rasmus Hojlund at half-time and took five minutes to crash the ball into the net. And crash the WiFi.",
      "Liam Delap's decision to join Chelsea over United is merely a stay of execution for Hojlund. United need a proven goalscorer, not one born four days after Hojlund and jettisoned by City's academy to a promoted team who Jason Wilcox watched develop.

      "What a goal that would have been! Mount opens his body up and curls a wonderful effort towards goal from around 22 yards out. It looks set to go into the bottom corner, but Tse gets down well to make a brilliant save.",
      "United have started really well in this second half and are deservedly level via Obi's clinical finish.",
      "They are now pushing for a second goal. Hong Kong have offered nothing in an attacking sense since Juninho's opener after 19 minutes.",
      "That's the start to the second half United wanted. Obi swivles inside the box and drills a low, left-footed drive into the corner. A great finish from the youngster.",
      "United are appealing for an early penalty in this second half after Dorgu is dragged to the turf. You've seen them given.",

      "Another chance goes begging for United. A corner comes in from the right, Fredricson meets it with a firm header, but nods it straight at the goalkeeper.",
      "That was comical. The audacity of Fernandes' attempt, the first touch from Hojlund and the shot cleared off the line. You have to laugh. United have played enjoyable football but they could not score in a you-know-what.",
      "With the exception of Juninho's shot that has given Hong Kong the lead in this game, the hosts have offered nothing. They have rarely got close to United's penalty area to trouble Heaton.",

      "PSG have taken the long road to Champions League glory – with humiliations by Manchester United and Newcastle – but Luis Enrique has ended their ‘obsession’.",
      "",
      "“The Champions League is not at all an obsession – that is over. I said that at the first press conference with Luis Enrique,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi with all the conviction of a man whose sportswashing had shrunk under the pressure of one too many loads.",
      "“We are building a new identity; our own style, our own principles of how to play, an offensive play, and a new culture. That’s what we want, and then the results will follow.",
      "“We are building a team that is really playing as a team. We want our players to enjoy playing, our staff to enjoy coaching, and for our fans to enjoy it when you watch.”",
      "Ten days later, PSG were beaten 4-1 at St James’ Park. The players, staff and fans cannot have particularly enjoyed watching Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff and Fabian Schar score against Europe’s perennial underachievers – although the schadenfreude was irresistible for neutrals.",
      "It has been a long, arduous and often absurd journey to the summit. PSG have avoided the ultimate ignominy of exiting at the group stage ever since this odyssey began, but the trade-off for that has been a preposterous propensity to stumble at all manner of other hurdles: consecutive away-goal eliminations by Barcelona and Chelsea; victims of La Remontada; a humiliation so thorough it forced Manchester United to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer their manager for more than two years; being entirely and utterly Karim Benzema’d in the Bernabeu.",
      "PSG and the Champions League had been in a toxic, unrequited relationship for years, and the former was kidding itself if they ever believed themselves to be in a position to declare it “over”.",
      "But Luis Enrique has broken the cycle.",
      "The Spaniard’s words at his unveiling became a eulogy at the funeral of Inter’s entire psyche. “The attacking identity is non-negotiable – it’s my philosophy. You have to adapt to your players, my job is to get the best out of my players individually and collectively. I am committed to putting a winning team together and I have no doubt that I will be able to do that and give PSG fans something they will like.”",
      "There were tears in the stands, in the dugout, on the pitch. It was historic but harrowing, a traumatic scene of youthful exuberance obliterating grizzled experience. It was the end of the road for Inter, who would have taken Boyz II Men 0 as early as the 20th minute had they been offered the choice. And after almost a decade and a half it is the belated start of what PSG hope to translate into a period of utter dominance.",
      "Over the course of those 90 minutes it was difficult to envisage any other scenario developing over the next few years. The youngest starting line-up in a Champions League final this century produced two of the five youngest ever European Cup final scorers. The man of the match was 19-year-old Desire Doue. The only player older than 30 of the 16 used was record appearance maker Marquinhos. This is not a group on the verge of disbanding.",
      "That provided an interesting juxtaposition with Inter, for whom this was a second Champions League final in three years, but with the tangible sense it would be their last together. The future of Simone Inzaghi is deeply uncertain, three of their starters were at least 36 and the rest were made to look twice as old. PSG started by hammering the ball out for a throw-in deep in Inter’s half and for the subsequent hour and a half rarely afforded them the opportunity to escape.",
      "This was their last stand and the early mistakes betrayed it, culminating in the double salvo from Federico Dimarco which ended the game as a contest. He was caught in his own offside trap and then later isolated by Doue down the right as PSG took the quickest two-goal lead in final history.",
      "Willian Pacho was winning everything, including a battle with Nico Barella as the Inter midfielder hoped to shepherd the ball out for a corner, only for the PSG centre-half to poke it away and launch the counter which produced the second goal. Achraf Hakimi started popping up at centre-forward and on the left-wing.",
      "Hakan Calhanoglu, the set-piece master, was gifted a presentable free-kick in the vicinity of the PSG area and thumped it straight out for a goal kick early in the second half; it summed the proceedings up neatly.",
      "Then came the landslide. Inzaghi made his changes, four by the hour mark. The sight of Matteo Darmian taking to the pitch somehow did not galvanise Inter but PSG derived motivation from it anyway, hitting a ridiculous triple punch of quality goals: Vitinha to Doue; Ousmane Dembele to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia; Bradley Barcola to fellow substitute Senny Mayulu.",
      "It was almost painful to watch by the end, particularly through the prism of the hapless Francesco Acerbi.",
      "Perhaps only Kylian Mbappe had a more uncomfortable night as the modern-day Michael Owen: the prodigy distracted by the lights of Real Madrid, only for his boyhood club to thrive and immediately capture the sport’s biggest prize in his absence. He might be able to console himself with having scored in that Newcastle defeat.",
      "As it is, the evening belonged not to Al-Khelaifi – despite some weird yet entirely predictable “win for football” nonsense – but Luis Enrique. His personal story is touching enough but even on a professional level it is refreshing to watch such a phenomenally talented and often overlooked coach achieve something so historic.",
      "This PSG success cannot be framed properly without acknowledging the vast spend needed to deliver it. With the highest wage bill in Europe and over £200m invested on transfers this season alone it is, in many ways, simple maths. But Enrique going where incredible managers before him could not at least means something.",
      "And that thing, ultimately, is a Super Cup final against Spurs. It is the showdown of Europe’s true greatest teams we all deserve, and the only real way to celebrate the long-awaited climax of an “obsession”.",
      "There are 10 Champions League final participants who are either Premier League rejects or never made it there at all…",
      "Chelsea rejected Luis Enrique twice, Arsenal turned him down for two reasons, Spurs pulled out at the last hurdle and Manchester United came close too.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique insists he’s “not worried at all” about facing Arsenal after the French side’s unexpected defeat against Nice.",

      "Manchester United players were “fuming” at being forced to go on a post-season tour of Asia which included three Red Devils stars being told not to “flip the finger to fans”.",
      "Four hours after their final day victory over Aston Villa at the end of a miserable season, the United squad jetted off for a two-game 36-hour tour of Asia.",
      "The players were booed off after a 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday, before a brace from Chido Obi and a stoppage time goal from Ayden Heaven secured a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong on Friday.",
      "The travelling party included several United players expected not to be at the club next season, including Alejandro Garnacho, who’s reportedly been told by Amorim that he’s not in his plans moving forward.",
      "The Argentinian is the subject of interest from Napoli, while Chelsea and Aston Villa have also been linked with a move for the 20-year-old, who’s valued at £60m by United.",
      "And he was one of three United players, along with Amad Diallo and Manuel Ugarte, ‘advised to refrain from’ raising their middle fingers to fans on tour, according to The Athletic.",
      "The report states:",
      "‘The tension of United’s trip appeared to be evident in a few instances of players flipping the finger to fans. Amad did so as he walked into the W hotel in Kuala Lumpur, following the first game, later apologising on social media in two posts a day apart but saying his mother had been insulted by an “unhealthy individual”. The words used are not clear from video footage of the incident.",
      "‘Separately, Amad had raised his middle finger in the direction of Garnacho during a packed elevator selfie with a couple of fans while Garnacho did the same to camera. Garnacho also showed the gesture at a signing event for supporters in the Adidas shop at the Exchange TRX mall in Kuala Lumpur, causing bemusement to the person taking the picture and as he walked off the pitch following the game against ASEAN All-Stars, the photographer there complained.’",
      "The gesture, which Manuel Ugarte has also been doing in selfied with fans all season, ‘was being used in an ironic, playful manner’, but after club staff ‘realised the negative reaction’ the players were told to stop it.",
      "A ‘swift return to families’ after the tour was thought to be essential given the players’ reaction to being forced to go in the first place.",
      "The report adds that both Victor Lindelof and Christian Eriksen were originally told they would have to join the touring party despite both of them leaving the club at the end of June when their contracts come to an end.",
      "‘But each one pushed back,’ the report states, with United eventually accepting Lindelof’s wife being heavily pregnant and Eriksen getting married as acceptable excuses for them not to travel with the group.",
      "According to reports, new Bayer Leverkusen head coach Erik ten Hag is plotting a raid on former club Manchester United as he looks to replace Florian Wirtz.",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has issued a ‘brutal message’ to Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho, who has been ‘kicked out’.",
      "Man Utd are willing to offer a ‘compromise’ to Napoli as they look to conclude a ‘quick’ deal for Alejandro Garnacho’s exit, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have been ‘contacted’ by the representatives of a Manchester United player looking to leave this summer.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has explained why he’s decided to leave Andre Onana out of the squad for Sunday’s match against Aston Villa."

      "“It is a possibility but it will be based on outgoings. So Cunha is expected to join and one more player [for the No 10 spots] depending on outgoings. This is the plan at Manchester United.”",

      "And United saw first hand just what the Gambian is capable of at Old Trafford in January, as he scored a goal and provided an assist in the Seagulls’ 3-1 win over the Red Devils.",
      "The report does though add that United will face competition for Minteh even if Brighton are open to his sale, with Liverpool, Tottenham and Arsenal also said to have ‘taken note’ of the forward."

      "And sure, the club has debt saddled on it by its owners – its not ideal, but again it’s not the death of the club just yet. Debt is designed for companies to use. It would have been nice not to have had the debt, but that’s our Glazers legacy, so we have to deal with it. People and pundits seem to say that United are dead and buried because this summer we can’t afford to stump up 100m for X and 75m for Y, and 80m Z wont come because we’re not in the Champions League.",

Bournemouth continue to sit top half of the table, give pretty much anyone a decent game, and have only ever paid over 25m once in their history. Ditto Fulham, who have never paid more than the 34m they paid for Emil Smith Rowe. Ditto Brentford. Villa only came back up to the Prem 6 seasons ago….!",

I love Casemiro, but hard to say his signing was astute and financially sound.",

Ugarte – hmmmm not so sure yet, looks a little lightweight for a DMC in the prem, and passing is shocking. Zirkzee – decent footballer, just a shame about his total lack of pace, odd signing.",

      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling.

      "And while Sommer has played a vital role in securing Inter’s place in the Champions League final, pulling off several remarkable saves in the knockout stages, United got to the Europa League final in spite of Andre Onana, who then definitely could have done better to deny Brennan Johnson his winning goal for Tottenham.",
      "",
      "Matteo Darmian\nLike you might thank an unattractive ex-girlfriend for dumping you as you stand next to your perfect wife, reflecting on his four-season career break at Old Trafford having helped Inter to the Champions League final in 2023, Darmian said: “I have to say thank you to them [United] because if I’m the player and person that I am, it’s also because of them.”",

      "Henrikh Mkhitaryan\nIf you believe this list to be just another way for us to take unnecessary potshots at Manchester United and kick them while they’re down, you’re not wrong but also must concede that a) it’s impossible to resist to given the regularity off their f*ck-ups, and b) it remains excellent fun.",
      "Mkhitaryan counts as another misstep, but his imminent part in a second Champions League final is more embarrassing for Arsenal, who bought him for the price of an Alexis Sanchez after 18 inauspicious months at Old Trafford ahead of similar humdrum displays at the Emirates before he left for Serie A on a free transfer in 2020.",
      "",
      "Ousmane Dembele\nThere’s no specific club-shaming here, but pretty much all of the big boys have been linked with Dembele at some point over the last five years or so – Arsenal in a swap deal with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang perhaps the most notable – and we’re guessing the bigwigs were of a similar mind to the rest of us in thinking they needed to steer clear of a Fancy Dan who was destined to never reach a full potential that he has now realised in spectacular fashion during a 33-goal, 13-assist season for PSG.",

      "Marko Arnautovic\nWe’re back to chewing out Manchester United after a brief palate cleanser, and Arnautovic snubbing their reportedly ‘desperate’ attempts to sign him in order to stay at Bologna in the summer of 2022.",
      "We were stifling chuckles even as United’s interest came to light, which we couldn’t contain after hearing it was the former Stoke and West Ham striker who told them where to go rather the Red Devils backing out of what was being described as a ‘PR disaster’ signing.",
      "They avoided that hoo-ha by landing Wout Weghorst. Close call.",
      "",
      "Denzel Dumfries\nAaron Wan-Bissaka is also the cause of embarrassment for United given his displays for West Ham this season as part of the ex-Man Utd XI that would give Ruben Amorim’s side a good roasting.",
      "But Erik ten Hag being ‘uninterested’ in using him as part of a swap deal to land Denzel Dumfries in January 2024, ahead of Wan-Bissaka’s departure that summer, has gained sliding doors status in the interim on the back of United’s switch to 3-4-3 and Dumfries’ continued brilliance as quite possibly the best wing-back in world football.",
      "",
      "Fabian Ruiz\nShame on Arsenal here, who plumped for Mikel Merino despite holding talks with Ruiz and PSG last summer, but more on Manchester United, obviously, who reportedly lowballed Napoli – who only wanted £21m for the £45m-rated star – in  the midst of their obsession with signing Frenkie De Jong from Barcelona in 2022, which ended in their infamous £60m panic signing of the 30-year-old Casemiro.",
      "",
      "Regret you won’t find on Merseyside after Liverpool went in a different direction to replace Jurgen Klopp you may well find in the boardrooms at Chelsea and Manchester United, after the Blues looked at Inzaghi before plumping for Mauricio Pochettino, while the Inter boss was somewhere close to the top of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s shortlist last summer before Ineos’ thorough top-down review of the club led to Ten Hag’s contract being extended.",

      "Only three players, Bruno Fernandes, Amad Diallo and Alejandro Garnacho, scored more than five goals in the Premier League.",

      "“You can’t deny his quality. If it wasn’t for him this season, they probably would be relegated.”",
      "United finished on 42 points, 17 ahead of the final relegated side, Leicester. Given Fernandes scored eight goals and assisted another 11, without him, things could indeed have been much worse for them.",
      "That is pertinent for the upcoming season, with a lot of speculation over the attacking midfielder’s potential exit. It’s said Fernandes’ agent has held ‘positive talks’ with Al Hilal over a very lucrative contract there, and he’s ‘giving serious thought to quitting’ United.",
      "Indeed, he’s said to be mulling over the proposal, with the Saudi Arabian side wanting an answer from Fernandes soon, as they’d like him for the Club World Cup if he was to be signed, which begins on June 14.",
      "It remains to be seen whether the United man would actually give up on the Old Trafford outfit, given he stated after the Europa League final loss: “I have always been honest. I’ve always said I will be here until the club says to me that it’s time to go.",
      "“I’m eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I’m too much or it’s time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I’ve always said it and I keep my word in the same way.",
      "“If the club thinks it’s time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it’s what it is, and football sometimes is like this.”",

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘reignite’ their interest in two strikers after losing out to Chelsea on the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap.",
      "United have been linked with a number of the world’s top strikers of late. It’s evident they need some quality in attack, after neither Rasmus Hojlund nor Joshua Zirkzee managed more than five Premier League goals this season, despite both playing north of 30 games.",
      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",
      "However, multiple outlets have stated Delap has instead agreed to sign with Chelsea, and GIVEMESPORT states that after United were ‘unable to convince’ him to sign, they will move onto ‘alternative options’.",
      "It’s been reported as a ‘major blow’ for Delap to have been taken off the board, but it means the Red Devils will apparently ‘reignite their interest’ in Randal Kolo Muani and Jean-Philippe Mateta, from Paris Saint-Germain and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "It is said United will ‘make checks’ over whether Kolo Muani would be an ideal fit, after they considered recruiting him in January, when he went on loan to Juventus – he scored eight goals in 16 Serie A games there.",
      "It is believed it would cost £35million for PSG to sell the Frenchman. But it’s said the preference at Old Trafford would be to land a striker who is already experienced in the Premier League.",
      "As such Mateta has come back into their thinking, especially after playing a key role in Palace winning the FA Cup. He assisted a goal in the 3-0 semi-final win over Aston Villa, while the Palace man has been in electric form in the Premier League recently.",
      "This season, Mateta scored 14 goals and assisted two. The report places him at £40million, though our friends at TEAMtalk suggest the Eagles would not let him go for less than £50million.",
      "They state that negotiations could be tricky, as Palace are keen to retain Mateta. He will play European football with them for the first time in his career, and that’s something which is not on offer at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd have ‘positioned themselves’ to sign a PL star as one of four ‘fallback’ striker options as Omar Berrada’s relationship with an agent hampers a £63m deal.",
      "Manchester United have made ‘initial contact’ with a £40m striker ahead of the summer transfer window as an alternative to Ipswich’s Liam Delap.",
      "Ally McCoist has stated he has not been “convinced” by Arsenal target Viktor Gyokeres yet, but feels a Premier League player who was suggested as good for the Gunners has ...",
      "Club football is back! Hurrah! But the Premier League isn’t! Boo! But that’s because it’s FA Cup quarter-final weekend! Hurrah!",
      "Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta has commented on his injury after his “ear was destroyed” in a clash with Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts.",

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4=) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – were said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6=) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. And they surely become an option again after reaching the Champions League.",
      "",
      "10) Napoli\nAfter seeing Scott McTominay become a hero in Naples, is there a part of Rashford that would like a slice of the same?",

      "It has been a fair while since we had a properly classic Champions League final. We take you from a goalless snooze-fest at 32 to the obvious No.1.",
      "",
      "32) 2003 – Juventus 0-0 Milan (2-3 on penalties)\nIt might seem reductive to consider the only goalless Champions League final as the worst, but the 2003 edition truly was a slog. It wasn’t without its moments – Andriy Shevchenko’s cruelly disallowed goal, Antonio Conte hitting the post and Andrea Pirlo striking the bar – but that second half in particular was a test of spectator endurance more than anything.",
      "Their Serie A meetings that season ended in a 2-1 win apiece but Old Trafford was treated to nothing of the sort. Even half the penalties were missed in the shootout as Dida ventured ever so slightly off his line.",
      "",
      "31) 2004 – Monaco 0-3 Porto\nTo prove that goals do not necessarily equate to a pulsating game, watch the 2004 Champions League final and retain your consciousness for the full 90 minutes. An audience not quite anaesthetised to the stylings of Jose Mourinho found that the novelty of two surprise success stories had worn off long before full-time as the Portuguese starved the occasion of any intrigue.",
      "Monaco failed to muster a single shot on target; Porto themselves only managed four as they registered less than 50% possession.",
      "",
      "30) 2010 – Bayern Munich 0-2 Inter Milan\nAs the BBC said at the time, it ‘might not have been one for the purists’. Mourinho was once at great pains to point out that he couldn’t properly empathise with Tottenham upon his appointment as manager in November 2019 because “I never lost a Champions League final”. This was a fine example as to why, as Inter channelled the determination and resilience of their semi-final victory over Barcelona to secure a remarkable Treble in unexceptional circumstances.",
      "It was also the first European Cup final to be moved back from a Wednesday to a Saturday, which remains one of the great first-world injustices of our time.",
      "",
      "29) 1993 – Marseille 1-0 Milan\nUEFA would perhaps rather the world forgot about the winner of its first revamped Champions League; the rest of the world would happily forget the final itself. Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",
      "",
      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",
      "",
      "26) 2001 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 on penalties)\nThe all-penalty final saw Gaizka Mendieta and Steffan Effenberg trade spot-kicks in normal time, with Santiago Canizares saving from Mehmet Scholl, before Bayern triumphed in an eventual shootout. There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",
      "Mo Salah put Liverpool in front in the second minute and while Tottenham were the better side thereafter, they never really recovered to the point where they threatened to equalise. Divock Origi provided the last slice of bread to a fairly mediocre sandwich just before the final whistle.",
      "After the ridiculous drama of the respective semi-finals, this was perhaps an understandable anti-climax and a case of the result being so very much more important than the performance.",
      "",
      "24) 2022 – Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nThis final, moved to Paris from St Petersburg, is remembered most for the shambles which unfolded outside the Stade de France and the shameful cover-up that followed. On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",
      "",
      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium. Real Madrid actually finished lower than Valencia in La Liga – fifth to third – but the nature of the destruction gave it an air of a typical domestic meeting rather than the biggest match of the season. Steve McManaman’s volley was lovely, mind.",
      "",
      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",
      "",
      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",
      "",
      "19) 2009 – Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\nThere goes that curse of the early goal again, the bane of many a neutral. Samuel Eto’o scored in the tenth minute and Lionel Messi the 70th as a ludicrous Barcelona side were just a level or two beyond Manchester United, who had just one shot on target in each half.",
      "",
      "18) 1998 – Juventus 0-1 Real Madrid\n“The 1998 Champions League final was possibly the most important game in Real Madrid’s history,” winning captain Manolo Sanchis once suggested, their 32-year wait to be crowned European champions finally coming to an end in Amsterdam. It was an incredible moment, but a fairly ordinary game.",
      "📣TO THE COMMENTS! What was your favourite and least favourite Champions League final? Join the debate here",
      "",
      "17) 2016 – Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid (5-3 on penalties)\nIn terms of grit and battle, 2016 offered up precisely what one might expect from a Madrid derby helmed by Zinedine Zidane and Diego Simeone. A total of 42 shots and 34 fouls made for a titanic tussle that Real eventually edged in a shootout.",
      "",
      "16) 2020 – PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich \nThe only final played behind closed doors when Covid was acting the d*** could have been a drab affair in the absence of fans but PSG and Bayern put on a decent spectacle in Lisbon. Both sides had good chances in the first half, with PSG desperate for their first European crown, but Bayern’s Champions League know-how told when Kingsley Coman headed in a winner on the hour before the Germans absorbed everything Mbappe and co. could throw at them.",
      "",
      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",
      "",
      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert. With two managerial legends in Louis van Gaal and Fabio Capello filling the dugouts, there might never have been a more stacked final in terms of talent. The game itself was no less captivating.",
      "",
      "13) 2015 – Juventus 1-3 Barcelona\n“Spectacular” was the word Luis Enrique used to describe Barcelona’s win over Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final. History is written by the victors, of course, but it seems a generous interpretation. Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",
      "",
      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour. Lionel Messi and David Villa had secured a third European Cup in six seasons before Sir Alex Ferguson knew what hit him, while Rooney was left begging for mercy.",
      "",
      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",
      "",
      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",
      "",
      "7) 1999 – Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\nWhen we finally drain the well of unoriginal content ideas and come to rank the greatest two-minute spells in Champions League history, Manchester United’s stoppage-time exploits against Bayern Munich in 1999 might well fare better. But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",
      "",
      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt. Jurgen Klopp side started far better but fell behind after an hour, only to equalise eight minutes later. Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",
      "",
      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

      "4) 1994 – Milan 4-0 Barcelona\nIf irresistible dominance is your preference – and no-one is here to kink shame – the 1994 Champions League final is a classic of the genre. Milan were without a number of injured and suspended players but ruthlessly dismantled Barcelona all the same. It just would have been nice if the Spaniards had turned up.",
      "",
      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard. The dismissal of Didier Drogba in extra-time might even have inadvertently decided the destination of the cup, as John Terry slipped 12 yards from glory before Edwin van der Sar kept out Nicolas Anelka.",
      "",
      "2) 1997 – Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus\nThe biggest surprise in Champions League final history benefited from an unexpected winner toppling a European superpower, a two-goal salvo from the uncelebrated Karl-Heinz Riedle, an understated backheel goal from Alessandro Del Piero and one of the finest examples of man-marking in the sport’s history as Paul Lambert shadowed Zinedine Zidane throughout. Add substitute Lars Ricken lobbing Angelo Peruzzi with his first touch and you have a classic.",
      "",
      "1) 2005 – Milan 3-3 Liverpool (2-3 on penalties)\nIt’s not really a contest. Nor should this have been and, indeed, at one point nor was it. A Milan side littered with generational brilliance scored the earliest goal in Champions League final history and then the best to lead 3-0 at half-time before annoying Steven Gerrard by “waving to their families”.",
      "Liverpool were unfathomably level by the 60th minute and won their fifth European Cup on penalties over a shellshocked Italian side. That extra-time double save by Jerzy Dudek from Andriy Shevchenko still defies laws of gravity and common decency.",

      "Many of their players have come under fire as the Red Devils underperformed with Hojlund only managing to scored four Premier League goals despite starting most matches.",

      "“Ruben Amorim needs someone to play behind the centre forward, Man Utd have no player who runs beyond and that’s one of the things that might have helped Hojlund if he had someone who’d run to create more space for him.",

      "Liam Delap choosing Chelsea is a massive blow for Manchester United – much more damaging than it would have been for the Blues had the 22-year-old snubbed them in favour of the Red Devils.",
      "Chelsea are an attractive club to play for right now; Manchester United are not. It’s not Delap or bust for Chelsea, but that feels very much the case for United.",
      "Delap was perfect: young; cheap; scores Premier League goals. And crucially, while United are terrible, they are definitely better than Ipswich.",
      "Not only do they not have European football as a draw, there’s also no light at the end of a tunnel which has grown longer under Ruben Amorim thanks to a philosophy and system almost laughably unsuited to the players in his squad. Any striker joining United this summer will wonder how long a contract might need to be for them to see a semblance of success at Old Trafford.",
      "History, a fading assumption that things must get better at Manchester United because This Is Manchester United and a promise of game time are about the only selling points Amorim and his recruitment team can use to lure players to the club this summer.",
      "That won’t be enough for Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike or other top-level goalscorers United would previously have been vying to sign, and our struggle to come up with these seven striker options – most of whom still feel like unlikely additions for various reasons – shows just how bleak things are for Amorim in the search for anyone who can put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nNaming United’s director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves along with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and sporting director Giovanni Manna in a report claiming a meeting has been held in Naples to discuss a swap deal for Osimhen adds a level of credence to a rumour we would otherwise have dismissed out of hand. Kudos to the reporter for their commitment to the clicks if it is indeed nonsense.",
      "Osimhen is a world-class striker who’s scored 36 goals on loan at Galatasaray this term and 100 goals in his last four seasons. He’s in that top rung of goalscorers currently available for transfer. And weirdly, despite being very available – Napoli are desperate to get rid of him with his contract expiring at the end of next season – there appears to be scant competition to sign him.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have turned their noses up for some reason, Paris Saint-Germain are no longer keen and even Chelsea appear to have gone off the idea of signing a brilliant 26-year-old striker for £65m on £200,000-per-week wages. Sounds good to us.",
      "And amid reports that, unlike other top strikers, Osimhen isn’t all that bothered about Champions League football, we wonder if the Nigerian doesn’t have something of a chip on his shoulder…a burning desire to prove doubters wrong.",
      "He can find a kindred spirit in that pursuit at Old Trafford in Amorim, and we’re sure (actually we’re not, but we hope) Osimhen would rather be scoring Premier League goals, even for Manchester United, than Saudi Pro League goals for whichever PIF club offers him a billion pounds a year to play in front of tens of people.",
      "",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta (Crystal Palace)\nWe love him and really don’t want him, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton or anyone else to leave Palace ahead of their Europa League campaign as Oliver Glasner – having already won it once before with Frankfurt – could do something really rather special with this group if he can keep them together.",
      "Reports suggesting Mateta is open to a move as he looks to catch Didier Deschamps’ eye ahead of the World Cup in 2026 begs the question as to whether he’s more likely to do that by staying at Palace and playing in Europe or through moving to Old Trafford. We’re leaning towards the latter as for better or worse, Deschamps – like everyone else – will be very aware of what Mateta is doing if he becomes United’s new No.9.",
      "He could be great as well. He’s what Rasmus Hojlund should be – a bully who holds the ball up well with a decent touch, brings playmakers into the game, runs in behind and gets on the end of crosses. Another significant boon for Amorim is that Mateta has thrived for Palace in the 3-4-3 formation he is trying to make work at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nAnyone not watching Villa week in, week out, and actually a fair few who have, would claim this was something of a fallow season for Watkins. A fair point compared to last term perhaps, but a Premier League return of 16 goals and eight assists meant only four players – Mohamed Salah (47), Alexander Isak (29), Bryan Mbeumo (27) and Erling Haaland (25) – finished the campaign with more goal contributions than the 29-year-old, in what was his second-best top-flight season in that regard.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team made a point of not wanting to sign players over the age of 25 when they took charge of football operations, in a bid to ensure their market values at least had a chance of increasing in their time at the club, rather than fading to nothing as has been the case for pretty much everyone signed in the last decade.",
      "The England international would have to hit the ground running and score goals at a fair lick to avoid his value dropping as he turns 30 in December, but needs must and United just need to find someone, anyone who can lead the line – as Watkins has done very, very well for Villa under Unai Emery – and score goals.",
      "",
      "Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen)\nHis age (29) is about the only stick you can beat Schick with given his schtick this season has been scoring more Bundesliga goals (21) than anyone but Serhou Guirassy (also 21) and Harry Kane (26).",
      "Reports suggest Bayer Leverkusen would be open to bids of around £30m for a striker who could probably be tempted by a move to any Premier League team – with or without European football – such is his long-held desire to play in the English top flight.",
      "Meanwhile, Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko, who have been linked with the top-tier clubs looking for strikers this summer, have both had £80m-£100m price tags slapped on them despite scoring 15 and 13 Bundesliga goals respectively.",
      "Schick would be a relatively low risk, cheap option for United.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nTalking of risk, Nkunku might just be the most perilous option. He’s done nothing at Chelsea to suggest he’s got what it takes to be a Premier League footballer. He’s done plenty to suggest he’s not cut out for it. And yet… he is a very talented footballer – ‘there’s a player in there’ as they say.",
      "But while that player could perhaps be uncovered at Liverpool or another stable football club, Manchester United are not in a position to be lifting a footballer from a slump, while a move to Old Trafford will almost certainly see Nkunku scrabbling on his hands and knees at the cloying soil at the base of the hole he finds himself to find the rocks at the very bottom.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nHis signing is unlikely to be widely heralded by the United fanbase on the basis of a Premier League career which saw him score just four goals in 39 appearances for Everton having been seen as quite the transfer coup when Marco Silva persuaded him to join from Juventus in 2019. He was only a kid at the time though and has developed his game in the meantime to become a far more rounded striker.",
      "Kean scored 19 Serie A goals this season, behind on Mateo Retegui (25), including braces against Roma and Inter, and goals against Juventus, Atalanta and AC Milan.",
      "He has a €52m [£44m] release clause, which feels reasonable, and may well feel as though he has unfinished business in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "We won’t profess to have seen Burkardt in action enough to make a claim over his suitability to United in terms of style, but everything about a move for him feels pretty perfect besides an eye test which we’re 100% sure would lead us to insist he’s a better bet than Hojlund.",
      "He’s 24, a Germany international, has frequently played in a 3-4-3 and has a release clause of just €20m [£17m]. The not insignificant issue for United is that Frankfurt have supposedly made Burkardt their top target if Ekitike gets poached by one of the big boys, and they can offer him Champions League football. But United should absolutely be looking into this one at the very least.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes holds the key to the Red Devils’ potential efforts to sign Victor Osimhen in the summer, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves has flown to Italy for a ‘meeting’ with Napoli owner De Laurentiis over a potential swap deal this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their preferred striker signing after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",

      "Tuesday 27 May 2025 15:53, UK",
      "Antony has revealed he considered retiring during his lowest moment at Manchester United but says he is \"smiling and happy\" at Real Betis.",
      "The 25-year-old Brazilian winger, who signed for United from Ajax for £85m in September 2022, joined the LaLiga side on loan in January after struggling at Old Trafford.",
      "Antony scored just 12 times in 96 appearances for Manchester United, playing only 14 times this season under Erik ten Hag and then Ruben Amorim.",
      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",
