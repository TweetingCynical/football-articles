      "Premier League giants Manchester United are finally back on top of the league - the league for bad behaviour!",
      "The club’s old Trafford ground saw more arrests for crowd trouble than any other Premier League club. United accounts for 12 per cent of all arrests at the 20 Premier League grounds for alcohol-related offences, Class A drug offences, violent disorder offences and arrests for possessing flares or throwing them and for throwing missiles.",
      "There were 75 arrests at Manchester United’s Old Trafford ground for all offences during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons compared to just seven at Brentford - the lowest in the league.",
      "The arrest rate at United - who have the highest average crowd in the league - is more than double the league average of 31 per ground over the two seasons. Just last month (April) Manchester United fan Alfie Holt, 20, was arrested and charged at Old Trafford after slapping Manchester City player Jack Grealish. He has since been banned from the ground.",
      "There was a mass brawl in the Old Trafford stands in January (2025) when United beat Rangers in the Europa League and in March last year (2023) there was more brawling in during the Europa League tie with Spanish club Real Betis.",
      "The club’s fans have had little to cheer about since its heyday under Sir Alex Ferguson when it won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles during his 26-year reign.",
      "Successive managers since his retirement in 2013 including David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Erik ten Haag and current boss Ruben Amorim have failed to return success to the club on the pitch.",
      "Even when they were riding high the club courted controversy when star player Eric Cantona pleaded guilty to assaulting a Crystal Palace fan in 1995 with a Kung Fu kick and a volley of punches after being sent off.",
      "West Ham has the second worst record for trouble with 60 arrests followed by Manchester City in third place on 59 arrests, Arsenal fourth on 47 and Newcastle United fifth on 46.",
      "Home Office figures for arrests for the two seasons were analysed by the betting tips subscription service TipMan Tips. Spokesman Fraser Bricknell said: “These figures show that criminal behaviour is a prevalent issue across all the Premier League clubs.",
      "“They highlight the need for a police presence at football matches. The fear is however that many more people are getting away with criminal acts such as drug posession, carrying flares and throwing missiles at stadiums.”",
      "Chelsea has the sixth worst record on 38 arrests followed by Everton in seventh place on 36, Spurs eighth on 31, Nottingham Forest ninth on 29 and Liverpool tenth on 28.",
      "Leicester City came eleventh on 27 followed by Crystal Palace in twelfth place on 26 arrests, Aston Villa thirteenth on 23, Southampton fourteenth on 20 and Wolves fifteenth on 18.",
      "Brighton came sixteenth on 16 arrests with Fulham seventeenth on 13, Ipswich eighteenth on 12, Bournemouth nineteenth on 10 and Brentford bottom of the table with just seven arrests - the lowest in the league.",
      "Total number of arrests at Premier League grounds by club during the 2022-23 and 2023-24 seasons for alcohol, pyrotechnic, missile, Class A drug, violence and missile-related offences:",

      "Atletico Madrid have already enquired about the possibility of signing Antony from Manchester United this summer as the Red Devils prepare to offload the 25-year-old. The club could accept a fee in the region of £34million and are prepared to cut their losses but will now hope to drive that price up.",
      "The Brazil international has so far failed to set the pitch alight at Old Trafford following an £86m move from Ajax in August 2022. But a loan to Real Betis earlier this year has seen him quickly find his feet in La Liga.",
      "Antony has notched six goals and four assists in 19 appearances in Andalusia, including a goal against Fiorentina in Real Betis' Europa Conference League semi-final. Perhaps unsurprisingly the La Liga side are interested in extending his stay.",
      "For their part, Betis believe Antony has already given them his word. They would be more interested in agreeing another loan deal with United however.",
      "Meanwhile reports in Spain claim that Atletico have made contact over the possibility of agreeing a deal this summer. And that could leave United determined to drive an auction.",
      "There is even said to be some optimism in Manchester that recouping up to £42.5m could be possible. United however, have parked any formal transfer negotiations until the end of the season as they focus on earning European glory in the Europa League.",
      "Former Spain international and Betis icon Joaquin is now on the La Liga side's board. The ex-winger has joked he would be willing to kidnap Antony in a bid to keep him at the club.",
      "\"I'll provide the car if he has to be kidnapped, but let him stay no matter what,\" said Joaquin. \"This is the moment to enjoy. I think important moments will come and we'll see later.\"",
      "Ex-Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea was in net when Antony found the net against Fiorentina on Thursday. The Spanish shotstopper is pleased that his former team-mate has finally been able to show his quality, though frustrated it came against him.",
      "\"I trained with him 1,000 times and he never scored a goal with his right foot in any training session,\" De Gea told Movistar Plus after sharing a moment with Antony post-match. \"But now he's confident and is showing the player he is.",
      "\"I haven't seen the shot in any matches, I think a player was in front of it and I couldn't see it, but he hit it well with his right foot. I'm happy for him because he was coming from a difficult moment at United and now he's showing the best of himself.\""

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits it is \"hard to watch\" Manchester United's continued struggles. The Norwegian led the Red Devils for three years and has seen the club decline following his sacking.",
      "Solskjaer was shown the door in 2021 after a string of poor results to begin the season. Throughout his tenure plenty had questioned whether he had the ability to truly lead the Manchester outfit back to the summit of English football.",
      "A 4-1 loss to Watford in November was their fifth reverse in seven games and ultimately cost Solskjaer his job. During their poor run they were humiliated 5-0 at home by Liverpool whilst Manchester City also secured a dominant win at Old Trafford.",
      "Ralf Rangnick was hired as Solskjaer's replacement, but failed to take the club forward before leaving after less than a year. Erik ten Hag, despite winning two trophies, failed to find the winning formula with Ruben Amorim now also struggling in the dugout.",
      "United will post their worst ever Premier League finish this season as they languish in the bottom half. The club are miles away from the success they enjoyed during Sir Alex Ferguson's era and Solskjaer concedes the table makes for grim reading every week.",
      "He told the BBC: \"Man United is my family and will always be part of me. In football, you don't feel sorry for anyone because we are privileged, absolutely 100% privileged to be able to work in clubs like this. But for me, it is hard to watch because it is your family that is struggling. It is never easy at the weekend when you look at the table.\"",
      "Solskjaer has returned to management in Turkey with Besiktas - a club he has compared to the Manchester outfit. A number of his decisions were continually questioned, specifically his loyalty to certain players. Harry Maguire was his statement signing in his first summer.",
      "The defender endured mixed fortunes and copped regular criticism with Solskjaer urged to drop the England centre-half, despite choosing to make him captain. Maguire has since endured a renaissance and the ex-United boss was always confident he would come good.",
      "He said: \"For me, Harry [Maguire] has always been a leader and a fighter. I was never in doubt when I signed him and he walked in the door he would be captain for us. There is another captain there in Bruno [Fernandes]. The two of them are top human beings. I was so happy for them last night. Those two and Victor [Lindelof] are probably the only ones I have heard from in the club since I left. You want the best for them.\""

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has doubled down on his claim that Manchester United shouldn’t have sold Scott McTominay. The Red Devils academy graduate quit Old Trafford last summer after a successful spell with the club.",
      "Italian giants Napoli sealed a £21m deal for the midfielder and he has gone on to be an inspired signing. McTominay has scored 12 goals in all competitions this season - the best goalscoring season of his career.",
      "That form has been crucial to Napoli’s title charge this term, with Antonio Conte’s men sitting three points clear at the top of Serie A. Solskjaer, McTominay’s former Man United manager, has slammed the decision to sell him, a call that looks even worse given the club’s woeful form this term.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Solskjaer said: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%. How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",
      "It is not the first time that the Norwegian has criticised United’s call to jettison McTominay. Speaking earlier this season, the now Besiktas boss said: “It’s still good to see Bruno Fernandes and Harry (Maguire) doing well.",
      "“And Scotty [Scott McTominay] is doing well at Napoli. I’m upset that we let him go because he was important last season when he kept popping up with goals. His heart and his knowledge of the culture were important.”",
      "Solskjaer is not the only former United manager to publicly criticise the club for selling McTominay. Erik ten Hag also claimed that he didn’t want the midfielder to leave, only to be forced into the decision by PSR.",
      "\"I’m very happy for Scott. As I said, when he left, I didn’t want this but that’s the rules the club had to deal with. The rules are, I would even say, bad, but that’s the situation created. It forced us to make this decision,\" he said.",
      "Elsewhere, Liverpool hero Graeme Souness has also questioned McTominay’s exit, while claiming club chiefs might be looking to bring him back sooner rather than later. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: \"Oh how Manchester United must regret selling Scott McTominay. He’s a fantastic modern footballer. A high-energy, box-to-box workaholic who chips in with important goals.",
      "\"He was 27 years old and not hurting United with his wages when the club’s ‘decision-makers’ thought it was a bright idea to sell him to Napoli for £25million. They’d gone out and spent £58m on an ageing, 30-year-old Casemiro, and paid him £370,000 a week. And another £42m on Manuel Ugarte. Collective transfer fees of £100m.",
      "\"Would someone at United please hold their hand up and say, This was my shout’. Because it’s been an atrocious piece of judgment.",
      "\"The perfect example of the mismanagement on an industrial scale at that club since Fergie packed in. McTominay has flourished at Napoli. Maybe United should be asking themselves how much it will cost to get him back.\""

He said: “I want to focus on our strengths and try to use our club to bring [in] one or two players, big players.

      "And with Osimhen’s loan deal with Galatasaray set to expire this summer - and little chance of him having a future in Italy - the Premier League duo could reignite their interest. He could potentially be even cheaper with a reported price tag of around £40m.",
      "But it appears that Osimhen has no interest in moving on from Galatasaray. He said: “It’s a great feeling. It’s great that they [young fans] are inspired by watching me, that they are wearing the masks. I thank God. I hadn’t seen this much before coming to Galatasaray.",
      "“Everyone showing this much love, the children shouting at the tunnel exit… I will continue to make them proud. The team winning, me scoring… I want to continue as they know me. If I can inspire my teammates’ children, that makes me very happy.”",

      "And that saw him eclipse the 31 that he netted for Napoli during the 2022/23 season as the Italian side ended their long wait for the Italian crown. Speaking about his achievement, Osimhen added: “It was important to break my record in my first season.",

      "Manchester United are growing optimistic they can recoup up to £42.5million (€50m) for Antony this summer in a major boost for Ruben Amorim's finances. The 25-year-old Brazilian has netted six goals and provided four assists for Real Betis since joining the club on loan in January.",
      "And Betis believe Antony has already given them his word that he would like to stay at the club beyond the end of the season. However, United are currently parking formal transfer negotiations until the end of the campaign as both clubs are currently fighting tooth and nail for European glory but in the background.",
      "Despite that, United have already decided that the signings of a new striker and No.10, namely Matheus Cunha, are their top priorities and they want to make those deals happen as quickly as possible.",
      "Antony scored for Betis on Thursday in their Conference League semi-final victory over Fiorentina and Old Trafford chiefs are also keen to hand other sides the chance to throw their hat into the ring.",
      "Atletico Madrid have also reportedly enquired about Antony's availability and United are determined to drive an auction as they know Betis might struggle to match their financial demands over a permanent transfer.",
      "Betis' preference would be to secure another loan for the ex-Ajax attacker, who joined the Red Devils in a deal worth up to £86m in August 2022, but United will push for a sale to bolster Amorim's spending power.",
      "Betis icon Joaquin, now part of the club's board, recently joked he's willing to kidnap Antony in a bid to keep him at the club, telling Spanish TV: \"I'll provide the car if he has to be kidnapped, but let him stay no matter what. This is the moment to enjoy. I think important moments will come and we'll see later.\"",
      "Antony's agent Junior Pedroso recently hit back at United boss Amorim over claims the winger struggled with the physicality of the Premier League.",
      "Still, the Brazil international appears to still respect the Portuguese coach, recently saying of Amorim: \"I've only had a short time working with [Amorim], but he's a very good coach.",
      "\"A very intelligent coach. United are going through a difficult time at the moment, but he's a good coach. I had a good relationship with him, but I needed a new challenge and I wish him all the luck in the world in this final stretch of the season.\"",
      "Interestingly, Betis saw loan bids for Antony and Christian Eriksen knocked back last August by United as Erik ten Hag wanted to keep the duo.",
      "But Antony only played 135 minutes of Premier League action during the first half of the campaign and the Red Devils were keen to save cash on his wages. His value has since sky-rocketed on the back of his fine form in Seville and United view the loan as a huge success."

The left-back, 22, joined Benfica from United last year and has caught the eye of clubs across Europe thanks to his impressive performances.",
      "When they agreed to sell Carreras for around £5million, United negotiated a buyback clause which is worth £17m. Benfica themselves moved to put a £51m release clause in the Spaniard's contract.",
      "Real are reluctant to pay such a high price in the summer transfer window, so have reportedly come up with a workaround. The Spanish giants, who Carreras spent three years with at youth level, are said to want United to activate their buyback clause and then immediately sell him to them for £29m.",
      "That'd net United a cool £12m in profit which would improve their well-documented financial situation, with Ruben Amorim's summer recruitment plans hinging on big-money sales. But Carreras' agent, Gines Carvajal, has poured cold water on suggestiosn that Real and United could form the controversial agreement.",
      "\"I don't know where this news comes from,\" Carvajal is quoted as saying by Sport. \"Everything being said is pure invention and doesn't deserve any comment from me.\"",
      "The agent went on to confirm that Carreras won't be going anywhere this summer, adding: \"Carreras is doing very well at Benfica and will continue there.\"",
      "In January, the 22-year-old affirmed that he was 'happy' playing for the Portuguese giants, who are battling city rivals Sporting Lisbon for both the league and cup with just a few games to go.",

      "Having left Madrid in 2020, Carreras never made a first-team appearance for United. He was loaned out to Preston North End, Granada and then Benfica, who signed him permanently in January 2024.",
      "United are well-stocked at left-back as things stand. The Red Devils signed Patrick Dorgu for £25m in January and have Luke Shaw back from injury.",
      "Tyrell Malacia is also due back from his loan spell with PSV Eindhoven unless the Dutch heavyweights sign him permanently. And finally, academy product Harry Amass made his Premier League debut in March and appears to be highly rated by United boss Amorim."

      "At one point, a fan in the crowd held up a sign to keep him up to date with United's fortunes. Littler had previously revealed that his side's heartbreaking FA Cup defeat to Fulham had inspired him to reach the UK Open semi-finals and eventually win the competition.",
      "He said: \"Obviously I am happy, I'm into the final of the UK Open at my third attempt. But in the second break I heard about the Manchester United loss so it spurred me on a bit, won the next five.",
      "\"Then I only needed one leg and I got the job done. Before the game I saw it had gone to penalties, first break I didn't think anything of it then the second break, then the third session was unbelievable.",
      "\"Having that five-leg gap and then you have to go off stage knowing you need to win one leg. I managed to do it. I know myself that my doubles isn't the best part of me. There's always room for improvement.\""

      "Crystal Palace have opened the door to Eberechi Eze leaving the club this summer with Manchester United and Tottenham chasing the winger. The England man has shone for the Eagles since joining the club from Reading in 2020.",
      "His performances have been key to Oliver Glasner's side reaching the FA Cup final this season. But it appears that they could bid farewell to Eze sooner rather than later.",
      "According to The Sun, Glasner has given his blessing to the forward departing the club this summer. Premier League rivals Spurs and Man United have been linked with a move for him in the past and with a £60m release clause written into his contract, they could be tempted to move over the coming months.",
      "Eze, 26, has scored nine goals and notched 11 assists for Crystal Palace in all competitions this season. Speaking about his displays after an FA Cup win against Fulham earlier this season, Glasner said: “I think Ebere has had a strange season, he hasn’t had many goals in the Premier League and he has been unlucky, but he keeps going, he’s also struggled with strange injuries.",
      "“The goal against Latvia and his first for England means a lot for him him. He always has the confidence, we know he’s an amazing finisher to cut inside on his right foot with an amazing finish. We need this quality, he helped us today massively.”",
      "Should Eze move on this summer, it would be the second consecutive post-season window that a star player moved on. Michael Olise completed a move away to German giants Bayern Munich last summer, with chairman Steve Parish left shocked that there wasn’t the same amount of interest in Eze.",
      "\"I was astounded. Genuinely astounded. I mean, the guy's just an outstanding footballer, an outstanding person.\"",
      "In reply to those comments, Eze claimed that he was not looking to move on any time soon. He said: \"I appreciate the words that they say. But I'm so focused on just being the best player I can be, whatever interest comes, or whatever happens.",
      "\"I want to enjoy my football where I am right now. The things that I can control, that's it. I'm really, really invested in becoming the best player I can be. Whether that leads me to another club, or to whatever, I'm at peace with that - and I try to stay there (at peace) as well.\""

      "Manchester United have been urged to sign Cole Palmer, Ademola Lookman and Viktor Gyokeres this summer. The Red Devils are set for a busy transfer window as they look to overhaul Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "There are a number of areas in Amorim's squad that need improvement. Attack appears to be the main point of weakness though, with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failing to prove they are top-level forwards.",
      "Hojlund has registered just 14 Premier League goals since arriving at Old Trafford in a £72million deal from Atalanta in the summer of 2023. Zirkzee scored just seven times in all competitions following his move from Bologna ahead of the current campaign.",
      "That poor return has convinced superstar fan Usain Bolt that United need recruits up-front. The nine-time Olympic gold medallist has picked out Palmer, Lookman and Gyokeres as prime targets.",
      "Bolt told B/R Football : \"The left winger from Atalanta. He's called Lookman, I've watched him throughout. He's pretty good. And I think Cole Palmer. He's really showed his class. And the striker is, is Viktor from Sporting. Those are the three signing I would definitely get for this summer.\"",
      "Palmer enjoyed a breakthrough season in his debut year at Stamford Bridge, scoring 27 goals and registering 15 assists in all competitions. This campaign has been more difficult for the England international though.",
      "He has hit the back of the net only 14 times in all competitions and is currently on an 18-game drought, dating back to January. Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca last week claimed that Palmer's struggles are a mental issue.",
      "\"For sure it's a mental thing, it's not tactical or technical,\" Maresca said. \"Cole is still the player who scored 14 goals in 20 games. The style is the same, the manager is the same, the club is the same.",
      "\"Nothing has changed around Cole. It's just mentally in this moment. You can see he's a little bit worried because he wants to help the team. You can see he's struggling a bit on that. But he showed how happy he was after Fulham.",
      "\"It's just a matter (of whether) we can win games. For sure he's going to score goals. If you go back game by game, he had at least every game one or two chances, so it's not about how the team is playing.\"",
      "Palmer will be hoping to break his drought on Sunday afternoon when Chelsea host champions Liverpool. It would be extremely difficult for United to buy Palmer, with the Englishman contracted to Chelsea until 2033."

      "Ruben Amorim is prepared to accept the humiliation of suffering Manchester United's worst finish to a league season for 50 years in a bid to fast-track his Old Trafford rebuild. Amorim has been told that the war-chest being prepared for a raft of summer arrivals could be boosted by £50million if he guides United to a Europa League triumph that will bring automatic qualification to next season’s Champions League.",
      "If they can keep the Spaniards at bay at Old Trafford this Thursday then Amorim’s men will have a shot at rescuing the season in spectacular fashion. And that will prompt the Reds’ boss to wrap his key players in cotton wool - despite the risk of an embarrassing Premier League placing.",
      "A dressing room insider said: “Ruben has made it clear to everyone that the focus must now be on the Europa League. There’s no getting away from the reality that this has been a poor season domestically, so to guide the team to a place where they can still qualify for the Champions League is a remarkable achievement.",
      "“Winning the Europa League would be huge in terms of what it would mean to the manager - but also in terms of what it would mean when it comes to providing him with the finances to rebuild the squad.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been United’s most consistent performer this season - and Amorim will manage his captain’s minutes in the games against Brentford, West Ham and Chelsea ahead of a potential final. Harry Maguire, Alejandro Garnacho, Casemiro and Noussair Mazraoui come into the same category, while keeper Andre Onana and striker Rasmus Hojlund are also likely to be safeguarded because Amorim’s alternatives are so limited.",
      "With the clash at top-five chasing Chelsea scheduled just six days ahead of the Europa final in Bilbao, there is a chance that the United team to face the top-five chasing Londoners could be severely understrength. United now face a Brentford team chasing European qualification knowing that they could finish in the bottom six if their Premier League results don’t improve.",
      "Erik ten Hag guided the club to their lowest finish of the Premier League era last season when they came eighth. Under Sir Alex Ferguson they never finished lower than third in the Premier League, although they did only manage 13th place under the Scot during the FA Cup-winning season of 1989-90.",
      "United’s lowest finish of the last 50 years was when they topped the old second division to win promotion back to the top-flight in 1975. Tommy Docherty’s side came 18th in 1973 before being relegated from the 22-team first division by finishing 21st the following season."

      "The young star is considered one of the most promising talents coming out of Argentina, and the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea are potentially lining up a deal to secure the teenager's services.",
      "Mastantuono, who turns 18 years old in August, has been highly praised by a host of footballing stars, including current Blues midfielder Enzo Fernandez and ex-River Plate star Matias Almeyda.",
      "While many have pointed to Lamine Yamal as the number one replacement for Messi's talent, Almeyda believes that the young Argentinian is emerging as Lionel's successor.",
      "Speaking to DSports Radio, the current AEK Athens manager said: \"Another Maradona or another Messi will unlikely emerge, but another player will come.",
      "\"After Maradona, people said that there would never be another like him, and then Messi appeared, and I think that after Messi, another one will appear, and his name is Franco Mastantuono.\"",
      "Almeyda also claimed that there will be more shining stars coming out of Argentina, adding: \"There are many kids who won't be equal to those two, but they will be at another level. We're a breeding ground for very good players.\"",
      "Mastantuono has also received some high praise from World Cup winner and Chelsea star Fernandez, who claimed the teenager is ready for the big move to Europe. When asked about the River Plate star, the 24-year-old told ESPN F12: \"He’s showing that he has a European future.",
      "\"You can see it. He’s an incredible player. He’s doing very well and has shown great talent. In my opinion, he’s a star. I wish him the best and hope he can achieve all his goals. Hopefully he can also help us in the national team.\"",
      "Current River Plate manager Marcelo Gallardo has also waxed lyrical about the young midfielder, but tempered his expectations for the star given his young age.",
      "Gallardo said: \"What we have to do is support him; he's a kid who has his feet on the ground, but it's not a bad idea to support him and make him feel like he has to keep growing.\"",
      "Mastantuono may well not decide to move in the summer, given that River Plate president Jorge Brito collected a £46million profit in last season's financial results - meaning they are under no pressure to sell.",
      "However, the 17-year-old has a release clause of just £38m - which is the highest-ever in the Argentinian club's history - but is relatively modest in terms of the Premier League's pricing in recent years.",
      "Mastantuono's contract also only runs until next season - 2026 - so it is likely that he could be tempted towards a future in one of the top leagues in Europe."

He added: “They have signed a coach in the middle of the season who plays with a three or a five-back, and the squad was built based on a four-back system.",

With the Beckham family, where the finale to the event would be on the Old Trafford pitch on the Sunday afternoon before a First Division match (Premier League, what was that?) between Manchester United and Tottenham.

      "Jurgen Klopp and Steven Gerrard both think Manchester United would be signing a top-quality player if they could pull off a mega swap deal for Ollie Watkins. United are claimed to be considering a stunning swap deal for Watkins, which would see Marcus Rashford’s move to Aston Villa become permanent.",
      "Rashford has been on loan at Villa Park since January, notching four assists and two goals in 14 games after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim at his parent club, United. The Red Devils previously valued Rashford at £40million but the 27-year-old could now be used to bring in his England team-mate, according to the Daily Star.",
      "Amorim is in desperate need of a quality No. 9 and could use Watkins’ current situation to his advantage. Watkins has become frustrated with his lack of game time since January, with Unai Emery preferring Rashford up top.",
      "The 29-year-old has found himself out of the starting line-up for much of April. But Watkins, who has 16 goals and 13 assists in 50 games this season, is still highly rated by various rival clubs, as well as some big names in English football.",
      "Liverpool icons - former manager Klopp and legendary Gerrard - have spoken glowingly about him in the past, indirectly giving United the green light to sign him. Gerrard worked with Watkins during his year-long stint in charge of Villa and paid him the ultimate sign of respect by comparing him to one of the best Liverpool strikers this century.",
      "\"I picture Ollie Watkins at his best when he's really front-footed, aggressive with that bit between his teeth,\" said Gerrard.",
      "\"He is a lovely player on the eye with the goals he scores and his technical ability. He reminds me in a lot of ways, in terms of his profile and how he goes about it, of a player I played with – Fernando Torres.\"",
      "Klopp was just as effusive when commenting on Watkins back in 2021, just months after the forward netted a perfect hat-trick in Villa’s 7-2 win over the Reds.",
      "The German said: “Ollie is a really, really talented striker. Obviously the manager knew him from before and it was a really good signing. The whole Brentford attacking line was exceptional in the Championship season before.",
      "\"So that suits really well, he's physically strong so he can keep the ball, he can jump high, he is very fast – that's a good package.",
      "\"Nobody has to remind me how good he is but how we always try to defend strikers, we try to avoid passes into their area. With him, that's not different than it is to others.\"",
      "But instead of Liverpool approaching Villa to buy Watkins, he was strongly linked with another top Premier League club, Arsenal, in January. Gerrard’s fellow Liverpool hero Jamie Carragher recently claimed that Villa offered the Englishman to Arsenal, but the Gunners only bid around £50m for him, which wasn’t deemed sufficient to allow him to leave.",
      "United are keen to offload Rashford permanently in the summer, but there's a chance Villa won't take him - or entertain any swap deal proposals involving the player - despite his upturn in form in 2025. Watkins, meanwhile, admitted he was angry with boss Unai Emery after playing a crucial role in Villa's win over Newcastle.",
      "He said: “I’m not going to lie – I was fuming I wasn’t playing. I let him know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision.",
      "“I wanted to be starting in the important games because I've played a big part to get to where we are today. Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger and let it spur you on to prove the manager different.\"",
      "One thing that could go against United should they continue to pursue Watkins is the fact that Villa remain in the hunt for a Champions League spot next season and look guaranteed to secure European football of some flavour.",
      "United, on the other hand, will have to win the Europa League to secure a spot in Europe next season, which could determine whether or not they land some of their priority targets in the summer."

A year later it was unravelling and although the game finished 1-1 and Brentford equalised in the 99th minute, the hosts had 31 shots and it was another reminder than Ten Hag’s tactics had gone to pot.

      "Ineos may be tapping Amorim on the shoulder after plane tickets were booked for Sekou Kone, Bendito Mantato and Jaydan Kamason. None of them appear to have travelled to London. Neither has Jonny Evans, who last started for United in Amorim’s first game in charge.",
      "Maybe Amorim has picked such a senior squad to keep the players on their toes ahead of the second leg. He has not gone overboard after the unexpected 3-0 win on Thursday night and he was never going to. United have lost 3-0 at home three times this season, so he is not going to entertain any hint of complacency.",
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",

      "Amorim is expected to make several changes this afternoon.",
      "\"Man United 3-0 Athletic Bilbao. Yanited!!!!!,\" was written on a sign held up by Luke Littler on Thursday.",
      "Littler held that message as he walked out for the darts Premier League final at Birmingham Arena, not long after the final whistle in Manchester United's game against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Just a day earlier, Littler was looking at flights to attend a potential Europa League final.",
      "You can read the full interview here.",
      "United have been slammed for wrongly suspending a handful of season ticket holders for over three months.",
      "Luke O’Shaughnessy and John Cunnane have four corporate season tickets and they have been caught in the crossfire of United's investigation into how Rangers fans invaded Old Trafford in January.",
      "United beat Rangers 2-1 in the Europa League and the Scottish club were supported by a sold-out away section, but their fans also acquired tickets in the home section of Old Trafford.",
      "The club said they took the \"strictest possible measures to prevent sales to away fans in home areas\" and launched an investigation. The findings of that investigation identified just over 1,500 Rangers fans in the home section, and many of those sat near O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane's season tickets.",
      "After the Rangers game, O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane were informed they had been sanctioned and they were not allowed to use their season tickets for the remainder of the season.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "United youngsters Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi are in contention to start against Brentford.",
      "Amad Diallo and Matthijs De Ligt, who both returned to action in Thursday's 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao after injury, were also pictured among the United squad who were catching a train to London on Saturday evening, and could be in line to start as they continue to build up their game time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may be among those players rested at the Gtech Community Stadium as Ruben Amorim prioritises United's Europa League semi-final second leg on Thursday but he was also pictured among the travelling party.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, are in contention to secure a place in next season's UEFA Conference League and they should prove to be a tough test of United's credentials.",
      "Amorim is expected to make changes against the Bees and a number of fringe players will hope to impress enough to keep their place in the side for Thursday's visit of Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Confirmed United squad members:",
      "Goalkeepers: Onana, Heaton, Bayindir.",
      "Defenders: Maguire, De Ligt, Yoro, Lindelof, Fredricson, Shaw, Amass, Dorgu.",

      "Manchester United will play Brentford in the Premier League this afternoon.",
      "United won 3-0 against Athletic Bilbao in the Europa League semi-final first leg on Thursday night, and Ruben Amorim will rotate his side against Brentford ahead of the second leg.",
      "The Premier League campaign has been written off by United, but they have a huge chance of winning the Europa League after securing an excellent result at the Estadio de San Mames.",
      "Here are five things to look for against Brentford...",
      "How many debuts will Amorim dish out at the Gtech Stadium? Amorim has already confirmed Noussair Mazroaui won't play because he's at his physical \"limit\", which suggests Jaydan Kamason could make his first appearance.",
      "Kamason is a natural right-back and has enjoyed a superb season with the Under-18s. He has recently been promoted to first-team squads and could get the chance to start on Sunday.",
      "Bendito Mantato was also named on the bench against Bilbao and could make a debut.",
      "Sekou Kone and Chido Obi travelled to the Basque Country, despite not being eligible to be named in the squad, and that also suggests they will be involved against Brentford.",
      "Obi was given his debut against Tottenham in February and he was subsequently given a handful of cameos from the bench, but he might make his full debut against Brentford.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund played the full 90 minutes on Thursday night and he is the only fit striker in the dressing room, so it would be logical to rest him and start Obi in a dead-rubber game.",
      "Obi has looked menacing off the bench and it would be fascinating to see him start.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is one of the finest forwards in the Premier League and he's been linked to United over the last few transfer windows, so perhaps he'll view Sunday afternoon as an audition.",
      "Mbeumo has been wonderfully consistent and is finally receiving plaudits for his performances, but he predominantly plays on the right wing and whether he'd be a good addition for Amorim's system is questionable.",
      "There's no questioning Mbeumo's ability, though, and he'll be looking to continue his excellent goalscoring form against United, having already scored 18 goals in the Premier League.",
      "United have been Jekyll and Hyde in the Premier League and Europa League this season, which was summed up by looking poor against Bournemouth and then hammering Bilbao in the space of four days.",
      "Amorim has won seven of nine Europa League games since his appointment from Sporting in November, but he's won just six games in 23 Premier League games in the same period.",
      "United have averaged 2.7 goals per game in Europe but just 1.2 in the league, and that record is unlikely to be improved against Brentford on Sunday due to the heavily rotated side.",
      "It's no wonder United supporters have preferred watching European fixtures this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored a brace against Bilbao. He has continued to be a driving force in a struggling team this season and will win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "With the Bilbao second leg around the corner, it would be a surprise to see Fernandes start against Brentford, which means he'll have to wait to reach 100 goals (he's currently on 98) for United.",
      "Fernandes has been directly involved in 35 goals in the league and cup this season, scoring 19 and assisting 16.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah has more goal involvements for a Premier League club."

The findings of that investigation identified just over 1,500 Rangers fans in the home section, and many of those sat near O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane's season tickets.",
      "After the Rangers game, O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane were informed they had been sanctioned and they were not allowed to use their season tickets for the remainder of the season.",
      "O’Shaughnessy attended the match with his family members, including his 12-year-old nephew.",
      "United wrongly identified O’Shaughnessy, whose road surfacing company is based in Heywood, Greater Manchester, as a Rangers fan because his nephew was spotted on CCTV standing to his feet and taking photos when Rangers scored in the 88th minute. His nephew does not support Rangers.",
      "O’Shaughnessy was shocked to learn his season tickets had been suspended and appealed. He also lodged a complaint with the IFO and considered legal action after weeks of frustrating correspondence with the club.",
      "Their professionalism has been praised by a United spokesperson and their season tickets have now been reinstated, meaning they can attend the Athletic Bilbao game on Thursday night, but they have wrongly missed each game at Old Trafford since the Rangers match on January 23.",
      "That means they were forced to miss the special 5-4 win against Lyon in the quarter-finals of the Europa League last month. And to make that worse, it transpired that their tickets were resold for that game.",
      "United have not apologised to O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane, but have offered a small gift to his nephew. The experience has left a sour taste in their mouths and they have felt \"voiceless.\"",
      "\"It's been a nightmare,\" Cunnane told the MEN. \"Initially, they said we took away fans, and that away fan turned out to be a small boy who was just cheering a goal at Old Trafford. He isn't by any stretch a Rangers fan, he's actually a Bolton fan.",
      "\"When we made that point, they came back and said we didn't scan our tickets properly, as we didn't distribute them to who attended. Luke said he was going with them, they were his tickets and they went into the ground together, so they said, 'well, you didn't do it right'.",
      "\"They asked for documentation to back it up, and he had that because he made a record of the phone call he made, with the day and time. They listened back to the call and reinstated the tickets.",
      "\"They blamed us for one thing, then when that didn't stick, they blamed us for something else. I've been ill with them. To be treated like that is unbelievable and it's gone on for months.\"",
      "Cunnane is business partners with O’Shaughnessy. Their four corporate season tickets in the Evolution Suite cost £30,000 per season. \"We have promised clients games and we've had to go back on our word to them. It has made us look foolish in front of our clients,\" Cunnane said.",
      "\"It's been a farce. I've copied in the chairman and the CEO on some of the emails. I've got a list as long as my arm for the emails I've sent. It's been so frustrating. I come into work to do a job, but I've had to spend time emailing them and that's been getting my goat up.",
      "\"They decided what the outcome was without speaking to us. I'm a lot older than Luke and it's been getting me down. I'm mindful we're losing clients over this because that's what they were bought for.",
      "\"I've had a season ticket myself, just a normal ticket, for years. I can afford that, but we pay for the corporate tickets to get in with clients, and I'm mindful we're losing business.",
      "\"It's all been over a kid standing up because he saw a goal. It was his first time at Old Trafford, and he wasn't bothered who scored. A goal went in, so he jumped up, but he did that because everyone around him jumped up, and everyone around him was a Rangers fan. You can see Luke on the CCTV looking angry and sitting with his arms crossed.\"",
      "O’Shaughnessy said: \"They can clearly see we haven't done anything wrong, they made a mistake and it just needed to be rectified.",
      "\"It's been an awful experience from start to finish. We were already angry at missing the Lyon game and the fact that they've sold them to other people.",
      "\"You think, hold on a minute, we're still fighting our corner here. I was told I didn't have to transfer the tickets and that was recorded on the phone, so there is no arguing that. They had to reinstate them, but they haven't officially come out and said to us 'we've got this wrong', 'we're sorry' or 'what can we do to make it up to you'. There has been none of that.",
      "\"It's been, 'oh yeah, you were right and we'll reinstate your tickets, see you later'. My nephew has felt a bit responsible for the situation, and he's been down about it, so I said, would it be possible to get a signed shirt for him?",
      "\"We've been offered a goody bag. I said anything they could do, we'll be grateful for, and that's all it was.\"",
      "O’Shaughnessy continued: \"If we were guilty of something, we'd hold our hands up and take it on the chin, but we didn't do anything wrong. I was at the game and we were surrounded by Rangers fans. They were everywhere.",
      "\"That's why we were taken aback by being told we were being sanctioned for it. We were the only real United fans in our section, so it was really bizarre. For a good couple of months, it felt like we were on our own and we had no voice to speak out. It was their decision and that was it.\"",
      "O’Shaughnessy and Cunnane now have to go through an official refund process to try to claim back the money for the games they missed, but that won't compensate them for missing the Lyon match, in particular.",
      "\"It was one of the best Old Trafford nights for years and we missed it,\" said O’Shaughnessy."

      "United produced a massive statement of intent on Thursday night as they battered Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in the San Mames Stadium thanks to goals from Casemiro and a Bruno Fernandes brace.",
      "It keeps Ruben Amorim's dream alive to bring silverware to Old Trafford in his first season, something that could have a pivotal impact on United's transfer business in the summer window.",
      "Here, we will be focusing on the transfers with the rumour mill increasing. Matheus Cunha, Patrick Schick, Jonathan Tah and Liam Delap have all been linked with a move to United.",
      "There's also the exciting scope of exits that could increase United's transfer kitty. Antony, who scored another goal for Real Betis last night, is attracting interest from Spain with Marcus Rashford also keen on a move away.",
      "With this in mind, keep across all the latest United transfer news in our live blog updates below:",
      "TBR Football report Man United are 'chasing a deal' to sign Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo.",
      "However, they are not alone in their pursuit with Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Newcastle all credited with an interest. Clubs in the Saudi Pro League are also said to be keeping tabs on his situation.",
      "With a departure likely this summer, the report adds that the Middle East is the 'most likely' destination for the 25-year-old, as things stand.",
      "According to Brazilian outlet UOL, Arsenal are among the clubs to have made an 'enquiry' about winger Antony.",
      "The 25-year-old has been a standout performer, impressing enough that Real Betis are eager to make his loan move permanent. However, interest in him is growing, with other clubs also monitoring his situation.",
      "Arsenal’s approach follows reports from Spain claiming that Atletico Madrid have also made contact regarding Antony.",
      "His future at Old Trafford remains uncertain beyond the summer with head coach Ruben Amorim expected to make a decision upon Antony's return to Manchester.",
      "According to Inside Futbol, Man United are looking to activate the buy-back clause to bring Álvaro Carreras back to Old Trafford.",
      "The 22-year-old initially joined Portuguese giants Benfica on loan before making the move permanent last summer. However, United had included a buy-back clause in the deal, valued at €18m (£15m).",
      "That said, Carreras is also drawing attention from Real Madrid, who are reportedly interested in signing the left-back.",
      "Manchester United still have a few days to wait before they are back in Europa League action against Athletic Club.",
      "A Casemiro header and brace from Bruno Fernandes gave Amorim's men a comfortable lead at the Estadio de San Mames heading into the reverse fixture at Old Trafford, with the hosts going down to ten men on Thursday night.",
      "United have been forced to deal with several injury concerns throughout the season, and it will be the same for Athletic Club next Thursday. Ernesto Valverde, manager of the La Liga club, is sweating on the availability of some key players on the sidelines for the trip to Manchester.",
      "One player who is guaranteed to miss the match is Dani Vivian, who will be suspended for the match against United. The defender was sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity in the first leg at the San Mames and will now serve a one-match ban in a huge blow for the Basque outfit.",
      "In terms of injuries, Bilbao could still be without midfielder Oihan Sancet for the return fixture in Manchester next week. The Spain international missed the first leg in Bilbao with a muscle injury and it remains uncertain if he will be available to face United next Thursday.",
      "There were also concerns about Nico Williams' fitness going into the first leg between United and Bilbao. The forward played the first 79 minutes of the contest in Spain on Thursday before being substituted, with the days leading up to the fixture seeing doubts about whether or not he would be available due to an ongoing groin injury over the last few weeks.",
      "The future of Jonathan Tah is expected to be decided soon with both Barcelona and Real Madrid reportedly interested in his services.",
      "Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg says: \"Manchester United have entered the race for Jonathan Tah and want to sign the 29-y/o centre-back on a free transfer this summer.",
      "\"Talks with his management have taken place. Tah still hasn’t signed with FC Barcelona – but Barca definitely want him. FC Bayern and Real Madrid are also in for him, as long as the move to Barcelona hasn’t been finalised.\"",

      "\"After Maradona, people said that there would never be another like him, and then Messi appeared, and I think that after Messi, another one will appear, and his name is Franco Mastantuono. There are many kids who won't be equal to those two, but they will be at another level. We're a breeding ground for very good players.\"",

As exclusively revealed in October, Gyökeres can leave Sporting this summer for €60–70 million, due to a verbal agreement between the player and the club.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney, who previously heaped praised on Wharton said: \"Attacking players get a lot of the credit, but Adam Wharton was outstanding. His commitment and winning the ball back – I thought he was the best player on the pitch.\"",
      "United are hoping to get between £34million and £43million in order to sell Antony this summer, according to El Chiringuito TV.",
      "The Brazil star, who has spent the second half of the season on loan at Real Betis, has scored six goals and added four assists in 19 matches since joining the La Liga club.",

Rashford has been on loan at Villa Park since January, contributing four assists and two goals in 14 matches after being frozen out by Ruben Amorim at his parent club, United.",
      "\"I picture Ollie Watkins at his best when he's really front-footed, aggressive with that bit between his teeth,\" said the then-Villa boss, Gerrard. \"He is a lovely player on the eye with the goals he scores and his technical ability. He reminds me in a lot of ways, in terms of his profile and how he goes about it, of a player I played with – Fernando Torres.\"",
      "Klopp was similarly complimentary speaking of Watkins back in 2021, only months after the forward’s perfect hat-trick against the Anfield side in a remarkable 7-2 victory for Villa.",
      "\"Ollie is a really, really talented striker,\" Klopp said. \"Obviously the manager knew him from before and it was a really good signing. The whole Brentford attacking line was exceptional in the Championship season before.",
      "\"So that suits really well, he's physically strong so he can keep the ball, he can jump high, he is very fast – that's a good package. Nobody has to remind me how good he is but how we always try to defend strikers, we try to avoid passes into their area. With him, that's not different than it is to others.\"",

      "Mastantuono made his senior debut in January 2024 and he then became the club's youngest ever goal-scorer the following month. The teenager has promptly established himself as a firm fixture in the first-team set-up, and made 41 appearances throughout his maiden season.",
      "United are understood to be interested in snapping-up Mastantuono and he could prove to be an astute addition as Amorim tries to strengthen his squad this summer.",

He never had a primary role at Man United, while here we gave him one. He’s worked hard and now he’s a complete player. His improvement has been shared by the whole team. Otherwise, it would be hard to explain how we’ve earned 74 points.”",

      "Back in 2019, INEOS acquired Nice for the sum of £89m (€100m), with the club's fans initially hopeful that through the financial muscle of the firm and British billionaire Ratcliffe they would be able to become genuine contenders in a domestic league that has become totally dominated by Paris Saint-Germain in recent years.",
      "But it hasn’t panned out that way, with Nice having failed to finish above fifth in the six years under INEOS’ stewardship, with one of their best campaigns coming during a period when the firm had to take a back seat in terms of hands-on ownership due to UEFA rules around competing clubs in European competition being under the same ownership.

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that."

      "As evidence of just how unexpectedly smoothly things went for Manchester United in Bilbao, witness the sight of Matthijs de Ligt and Amad coming off the bench to begin their return to match fitness after a spell on the sidelines.",
      "De Ligt got as routine a 25 minutes in the centre of defence as it's possible to imagine in a Europa League semi-final, easing his way back in after a month out, while Amad played the final six minutes plus stoppages after returning from almost three months out with an ankle problem.",
      "Both were spotted in full training for the first time at Carrington on Wednesday and were included on the bench at San Mames, but Ruben Amorim could never have imagined the first leg of this tie would go so well that he could get minutes into both. With more than one foot now in the final on May 21, Amorim will be hoping to have both available to start back in Bilbao.",
      "That shouldn't be an issue for De Ligt. There are places up for grabs in defence, and he would start ahead of Victor Lindelof from the team that began on Thursday. The 25-year-old has to have a chance of starting at Brentford on Sunday and aiming for an hour at the Gtech Community Stadium, which might be enough to see him start against Athletic at Old Trafford on Thursday.",
      "There will be a little more caution with Amad, whose absence from training has been longer. He was initially ruled out for the season after suffering an ankle ligament injury in training, but that was soon downgraded, and he should now have an excellent chance of starting United's biggest game of the season.",
      "The question might be where he starts. Having begun life under Amorim as a wing-back, Amad was moved into a No. 10 role and thrived there from mid-December, with the head coach keen to utilise a left-footer in one of those attacking positions.",
      "But Amorim has struck on a nice balance in the Europa League, and the four midfield positions arguably pick themselves now, with Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro deep and Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho as No. 10s. It's hard to see any disruption to that, although Amorim could opt to replace Garnacho with Amad.",
      "Maybe the more likely route into the team is that Amad returns to his wing-back role, and he could be the perfect replacement for Diogo Dalot, who is injured at the moment and will face a battle to return in time for the final. Noussair Mazraoui has filled in for Dalot, but it is Amad who will offer far more attacking thrust down the right.",
      "Amad has shown he is a capable wing-back and a far more attacking option than the dependable Mazraoui. It would mean two left-footers in the wide roles, with Patrick Dorgu on the other flank, but Amorim has been happy to field that kind of combination previously.",
      "It might also be a chance to trial Amad in that position ahead of next season. As good as he has been as a No. 10, United have a surfeit of players fighting for those positions, and Matheus Cunha's expected arrival will only add to the backlog.",
      "At wing-back, the competition isn't as fierce. With Geovany Quenda now set to sign for Chelsea, it could mean Amorim either looks for an alternative signing in that position or uses Amad there more regularly. He has the versatility to play as an attacking midfield one week and then at wing-back the next, with Dalot remaining a reliable option as well.",
      "Having Amad back is going to be a significant boost for United. Had he not suffered that injury when at the peak of his powers this season, he could have been challenging Fernandes for player of the year honours.",
      "As it is, his return will give Amorim a second game-changing starter and in a final that could make the difference. Amad has proved he can do just that, whether he starts as a wing-back or a No. 10."

      "United had rejected a £30m offer from Premier League rivals West Ham in the August of 2023 but McTominay's desire to play regularly and the positive impact selling academy players can have on the Premier League Profit and Sustainability Rules, led to the deal being completed.",

      "Salford City fell one goal short of a dramatic comeback against Carlisle United, missing out on the play-offs by a single point.",
      "The Ammies began the final day of the season in seventh place - the final promotion qualification spot. By full-time across all 12 final-day fixtures, Salford had slipped to eighth, edged out by Chesterfield by a single point.",
      "Carlisle, who were officially relegated from League Two last weekend, scored two goals in two minutes in the first half to put the Ammies on the back foot. Salford, majority-owned by Gary Neville, managed to claw back two goals but could not find the crucial third.",
      "The defeat has condemned the Greater Manchester club to their seventh consecutive season in the fourth tier of English football. It is also the second time Salford have finished one spot outside the play-off positions.",
      "The Ammies have only made it into the play-offs once before, in the 2022/23 season. Despite beating Stockport County at home in the first leg of the play-offs that season, they were defeated on penalties in the second leg after losing 2-1 away.",
      "For a team that is owned by proven winners, Salford have struggled for success. Neville is joined by fellow Class of '92 members Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes as owners of the club. They are all part of 'Project 92,' the organisation that completed a takeover of Salford in the 2013/14 season.",
      "Gary became a majority owner when he bought the remaining 50% stake, which was owned by Singaporean businessman Peter Lim.",
      "Missing the play-offs also represents a financial blow. In 2020, the League Two play-off final was worth just under £500k. This would have been a welcome gift for Salford with their team value falling just under £4.5m according to transfermarkt.",
      "Salford's prolonged stay in League Two will now extend to a seventh season — the third-longest current run in the division. Newport County top that chart with 12 seasons and Colchester follow in second at nine."

      "\"Man United 3-0 Athletic Bilbao. Yanited!!!!!,\" was written on a sign held up by Luke Littler on Thursday.",
      "Littler held that message as he walked out for the darts Premier League final at Birmingham Arena, not long after the final whistle in Manchester United's game against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Just a day earlier, Littler was looking at flights to attend a potential Europa League final.",
      "\"When Maguire scored the winner against Lyon, I put on my Instagram, 'can you wear the No.9 shirt' and he replied with laughing emojis. But I don't really speak to them [players],\" he said.",
      "\"Although I don't think anyone knows this, I recently messaged Mason Mount on Instagram just to say it was good to see him back in training again. We bought him and thought he'd be great, but he's had a few injuries. I'd love to see him get into the starting team and score goals.\"",
      "Littler has taken darts by storm since a sensational debut at the 2024 World Championships in which he reached the final at just 16 years old. The nation was gripped and Littler has subsequently grown darts exponentially.",
      "A year after his debut at the Worlds, Littler returned to Alexandra Palace and won the tournament, defeating Michael van Gerwen with a display that confirmed he's a darting phenomenon.",
      "After that breakthrough, United invited Littler to Old Trafford to parade the Sid Waddell Trophy on the pitch. \"It was great, apart from the result, a 3-0 loss against Brighton,\" said Littler. \"I've always dreamt of doing that and going there with the biggest trophy in darts, winning it at 17... it was surreal.",
      "\"I spoke to a guy at United and he said usually people go have a drink at half-time, but there were still 40,000 people staying in their seats to see the trophy and that was crazy to see.\"",
      "David Beckham contacted Littler after his Worlds triumph and he's planning to visit the United legend at Inter Miami. \"Once we're in New York for the darts, I'll try to go over,\" he said.",
      "\"I'll try to watch a game and try to meet Beckham,\" he added, before admitting that it would be fun to meet Inter Miami star Lionel Messi, even as a staunch Cristiano Ronaldo fan.",
      "Littler has become one of the most recognisable faces in Britain thanks to his extraordinary rise in the last two years, and brands have flocked to collaborate with the Warrington-born lad.",
      "Deliveroo have launched the Luke Littler x Deliveroo Best Kebab Award and the campaign has gone viral. The Golden Kebab Trophy will be handed out to the winner and Manchester locals can have their say in the competition, which will officially crown the nation's best kebab.",
      "\"It's good to work with them, everyone knows I like a kebab now and again,\" explained Littler. \"We've brought back the Best Kebab Award, and we'll see who wins it in the north west.",
      "\"It's been good fun bringing it back and hopefully loads of people have got their votes in, and we'll see who wins the prestigious gold kebab. My order is just a plain kebab, nice and easy.\"",
      "Littler's success has opened doors for varied opportunities, and he visited Carrington last year to play Harry Maguire and Christian Eriksen in a darts challenge. \"I'd probably say Eriksen was better than Maguire, he won one of the challenges. But he definitely doesn't practice,\" he laughed.",
      "\"I also went to Carrington after my first World Championship [January 2024]. I met the players and met Ten Hag. He was really nice, and I got a signed Garnacho shirt. He was my favourite player at the time and is still one of my favourites now, but I hope I can go back soon.\"",
      "Littler has also chatted with Sir Alex Ferguson. \"I met Ferguson two times last season and I went back recently. For myself and my dad, who has seen all the glory days, it was surreal,\" he said.",
      "\"I was just thinking 'what's going on?'. Sir Alex has got his own little place [at Old Trafford] where he sits with his friends. He owns a few horses, and we were talking about Bahrain because I was going over for the World Series, and he's been over there a few times to watch the horses.\"",
      "Littler was just five years old when United last won the Premier League title, but he said: \"I do remember watching it at home, and Robin van Persie's hat-trick against Aston Villa.\"",
      "The version of United that Littler has grown up with is chalk and cheese from the club's former glories, but the 18-year-old still admires several players in a group that has disappointed this season.",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is everyone's favourite,\" he said. \"If you look at individual performances, Mainoo got a goal against Lyon, but for myself, I love Mazraoui. He was very cheap and he's done amazing. He's played left-back, right-back, centre-back and has even played in centre attacking midfield.",
      "\"He's made 50 appearances in his first season and it's crazy to see. Garnacho is another one, some of his performances haven't been the best [this season], but we all know what he's capable of.\"",
      "Speaking about this summer, Littler said: \"Do you go for one of the bigger players, like Victor Osimhen, or someone like Liam Delap, who has outscored our strikers this season? I don't think Delap will want to be going back down to the Championship with Ipswich after this season.",
      "\"I'd love to see him sign. I'd not like to see Hojlund and Zirkzee dropped, but if they're not performing, then Amorim might go with Delap. Hojlund struggled to find his first goal in the Premier League, but he started scoring after his first league goal against Villa on Boxing Day [last season].",
      "\"He scored a few in the Champions League, but as you said, this season he's not had the service. He can use both feet, but I wouldn't love to see him be dropped. I'd still want him in the squad.",
      "\"That applies to Zirkzee as well, I think the fans are really starting to enjoy him. He is now fitting in, doing skills, so it was a big shame to see him pick up an injury because he was doing well.\"",
      "Marcus Rashford's future will also be decided this summer. \"Rashford has spent years and years at the club, and he's obviously needed to go away to Aston Villa on loan in January. He's been scoring and assisting and we're wondering where that form was for United,\" explained Littler.",
      "\"For myself, I'd like to see him back. I watched him score on his Europa League debut when he scored two, then Arsenal on his Premier League debut. I've just watched him for years and years.",
      "\"He's obviously getting older, but he's still got the pace and you can see it at Villa. It worked out for his first few games under Amorim, and he scored against Ipswich. I'd love to see him back.\"",
      "When asked about Ruben Amorim, Littler said: \"It's not been up what he would have liked, but I was reading about it the other day and Thomas Tuchel won the Champions League with Chelsea with a back-three and Antonio Conte won the Premier League with Chelsea with a back-three.",
      "\"I can't see why it hasn't worked. You see the class Tuchel and Conte had in their teams. Next season will be a fresh start, whether we have Europe or not, and then we'll try get back into the top four.\"",
      "Littler has a competitive but respectful rivalry with fellow top darts player Luke Humphries, and Leeds are set to play in the Premier League next season after winning the Championship.",
      "\"He's been chuffed to bits with them coming back up,\" he laughed. \"I just said to him 'you're going back down next year mate, enjoy it while you can'. We just love playing each other, the pace and quality of it.",
      "So is Littler looking forward to United's games against Leeds? \"Easy six points,\" he quipped.",
      "-",
      "Deliveroo has recruited British darts sensation Luke Littler to reintroduce one of the most iconic award categories back into the collection for it's 2025 Restaurant Awards - the newly-named Luke Littler x Deliveroo Best Kebab Award.",

      "Rashford has since replied: \"Keep going lil bro,\" he wrote in the comments section. The England forward was side-lined at Old Trafford under head coach Amorim - who excluded him from nearly all matchday squads following his final appearance on December 12, until he was loaned out to Aston Villa in February.",
      "Since relocating to the west Midlands, Rashford has become a pivotal figure for Villa under Unai Emery - chipping in with four goals and six assists.",
      "But in a blow to both Villa and Rashford, the club's academy graduate has sustained a hamstring injury. It's unclear whether he will play again this season."

      "One player who is guaranteed to miss the match is Dani Vivian, who will be suspended for the match against United. The defender was sent off for denying a goalscoring opportunity in the first leg at the San Mames and will now serve a one-match ban in a huge blow for the Basque outfit.",
      "In terms of injuries, Bilbao could still be without midfielder Oihan Sancet for the return fixture in Manchester next week. The Spain international missed the first leg in Bilbao with a muscle injury and it remains uncertain if he will be available to face United next Thursday.",
      "There were also concerns about Nico Williams' fitness going into the first leg between United and Bilbao. The forward played the first 79 minutes of the contest in Spain on Thursday before being substituted, with the days leading up to the fixture seeing doubts about whether or not he would be available due to an ongoing groin injury over the last few weeks."

This strategy proved fruitful; United claimed the Europa League title and secured a spot in the Champions League by defeating Ajax 2-0 in the final held in Stockholm.",
      "Van Der Sar was chief executive of United's opponents that night and the former United shot-stopper sees parallels with the club's present circumstances under Ruben Amorim, whose squad is positioned 14th in the league yet is on the brink of reaching the Europa League final following a convincing 3-0 victory against Athletic Bilbao in the semi-final first leg.",
      "\"I know they had it once before in 2017 and I was the other team in the final with Ajax. I was director, the chief executive,\" Van der Sar told the PA Sport News Agency.",
      "\"We were of course delighted to reach the Europa League final but when you're in a final you want, and you need, to win it.",
      "\"I think even that time United were outside the Champions League positions, so they were over the moon that they won the trophy.",
      "\"That situation or that possibility is still there for them, and hopefully they can save a small part of the season.",
      "\"But mainly being attractive for players and other personnel to come to United, and help them gaining respect, quality and not better players but different kind of players for the system that the manager wants to play.\"",
      "Despite being on the losing side to United in 2017, Van der Sar maintains a deep fondness for the club where he clinched four Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy during his six-year tenure.",
      "\"It's an amazing club, we had great success, a fantastic manager,\" he added.",
      "\"I spoke to (Sir Alex) Ferguson last month when I was there (visiting), and the guys who are running the club now.",

We've got to prepare like it's a game at 0-0 and go into the game and be aggressive and play on the front foot. We'll be going into that game next Thursday to win the game.

      "In a way, Amorim's praise for Hojlund's performance reveals a lot of what he wants from a No.9 in his 3-4-2-1 system. He praised his ability to make the runs and secure the ball, which is something Viktor Gyokeres excelled at when he played under Amorim at Sporting.",

      "But in Bilbao, he turned in a performance that was full of stature, at the very least. United scored three times, could have had more, and the attack clicked. Hojlund held the ball up superbly, and when he does that, his ability to link play and bring others into the game is excellent.",

      "Hojlund's stats contrast sharply between his struggles in the Premier League and his better performances in Europe, including in last season's Champions League. He has 10 goals in 19 appearances in Europe, from an xG tally of 7.8, and those 19 games have yielded 31 shots.",
      "In the Premier League, the 22-year-old has 14 goals from 59 appearances, but those 59 games have resulted in just 63 shots. The difference is pronounced.",
      "Hojlund certainly doesn't lack for confidence, and his social media posts have occasionally rubbed United fans up the wrong way. But he is self-aware, too. After breaking his goal drought against Leicester City, he didn't hide behind his lack of service and said he needed to improve, but there was also a forthright assessment of how he believes he can thrive under Amorim.",
      "It was interesting to listen to Bruno Fernandes talk about Hojlund at Bournemouth last weekend, when he suggested the striker needed to work on his attacking runs and make better decisions depending on who was on the ball. Fernandes also pointed out that the goalscoring had to be shared around. It was in Bilbao, but Hojlund's work helped in that regard.",
      "His run into the six-yard box, which resulted in the penalty being awarded and Dani Vivian being sent off, was aggressive and full of intent. He forced Vivian to take drastic action by showing the pace and power to get in front of his marker. Had he not been fouled, then maybe he would have scored.",
      "There is no doubt Hojlund needs to add more goals to his game, especially in the Premier League, but his European performances have proved there is a good forward there, if not a £64million one.",
      "But those displays only add to the conundrum around United's No.9 and many of the squad in general. Why can't they translate this form to domestic matters? It's a question Hojlund himself might struggle to answer and one that, ultimately, might have already cost him the role as first-choice striker next season.",
      "Even if a replacement does come in, Hojlund's Old Trafford career might not be over. He has been linked with Napoli and a return to Serie A, but Amorim's praise suggests he still believes he can fit this system. If United are in next season's Champions League, they will need depth, and Hojlund could offer just that."

      "After Thursday night's success, United supporters have received information on the allocation of tickets for the final, with the short turnaround between the semi-final second leg and the final meaning plans have to be made in advance.",
      "Although Athletic's San Mames stadium holds more than 53,000 fans, United have communicated to supporters that they will be allocated just 14,770 tickets for the game. Their opponents, either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt, will receive the same allocation.",

      "In the email sent to supporters, ticket prices were confirmed as ranging between €40 for Category 4 and accessibility tickets and €240 for Category 1 tickets.",
      "The email said: \"Following our first UEFA Europa League semi-final leg last night, we look forward to what we hope will be another thrilling return leg at Old Trafford next week.",
      "\"If we win the tie and qualify for the UEFA Europa League final there will be a very short window of just 13 days until the game and fewer than five until UEFA's deadline for tickets to be processed.

      "The low allocations could become a bigger issue if Spurs see off Bodo/Glimt in the other semi-final, setting up an all-Premier League final that will result in thousands of supporters of both teams travelling to Bilbao without tickets."

      "Tyler and Jack were regulars in the Old Trafford directors' box last season while still in the Manchester City academy and in attendance on derby day. Amid the bedlam over Bruno Fernandes' equaliser and Marcus Rashford's winner, nobody clocked whether the teenagers dared to celebrate.",
      "The 16-year-olds' allegiance will almost certainly have been with their father, Darren. The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",
      "The Fletcher twins' devotion to the red side of Manchester was confirmed when they crossed the divide to join United's academy in the summer for a combined fee of £1.25million. Should they emulate their father, they would become the 13th set of brothers to play for the United first team.",
      "Jack and Tyler were born on the same day Cristiano Ronaldo settled an FA Cup quarter-final replay with Middlesbrough in March 2007. Darren was present for their birth as he was recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "It was barely seven years ago that nine-year-old Jack and Tyler Fletcher were having a kickabout on the Hawthorns pitch with Kai Rooney eight days before Christmas. Darren was halfway through his final season at West Brom and soon started heading up the M6 and towards home in Manchester, spending two years with Stoke City.",
      "Fletcher attended meetings at Old Trafford towards the end of his playing career with the intention of joining United's new structure. His return was formally confirmed in January 2021 as a first-team coach and two months later he was appointed the technical director.",
      "If Erik ten Hag needs numbers in training on a recovery day for senior players, he or assistant Mitchell van der Gaag will consult Fletcher, who has become a conduit between the academy and the first team. Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",
      "Tyler made his international debut for Scotland in September 2022, then played for England two months later, defected back to Scotland last February before playing with Jack for England in their triumphant Montaigu Tournament in April.",

      "The Fletchers joined the City academy in 2014 - when their father was still a player at United. A source who watched Jack in the City academy is adamant he will play for the United first team. Sources at United stressed the Fletchers would not have been recruited from City if the club did not see first-team potential in them.",
      "Jack has already graced the Old Trafford pitch, long before his father first did five days after his 18th birthday against Hartlepool in the FA Youth Cup in 2002. Sir Alex Ferguson intended to give Darren his debut as a 16-year-old against Aston Villa in May 2000 yet Fletcher senior's first two years at United were stunted by injury.",
      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",
      "The memory is already soured. Swindon shocked United in the fourth round on Tuesday night with a 2-0 win at the County Ground.",
      "Jack got a ticking off from the referee for backchat. One of his corners failed to beat the first man and the second seconds later went over everyone. He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

In the background, there was a framed monochrome photograph of Ryan Giggs triumphantly hoisting the European Cup on the Manchester Airport tarmac in 2008.

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon."

      "Amorim is expected to rotate his starting team against Brentford at the Gtech Stadium and he has confirmed Noussair Mazraoui will not play because he's at the \"limit to get an injury.\"",
      "This is how our writers think United should line up against Brentford...",
      "United should play a completely different outfield team. There is no need to rotate the goalkeeper and Andre Onana has had a steady few weeks.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt and Amad could do with more minutes as starters after their return from injury in midweek. The midfield is an issue as United do not have a designated holding midfielder and that might be a role Mason Mount has to temporarily adopt. He has not created much and often gets booked, so he should be able to adapt.",
      "It is a logical day to give Chido Obi a full debut and Jaydan Kamason would be the natural pick in the absence of a senior right back/right winger.",
      "United's commanding position from the unexpected events in Bilbao have given Amorim licence to pick a stronger team than might otherwise have been the case, but I don't see the need to risk it, especially with a final now coming into view. Eleven changes it is.",
      "That means Bayindir gets a start in goal. In defence, Fredricson is back in, Shaw can start again on the left and it's a chance to get substantial minutes into De Ligt, with a view to him starting on Thursday night.",
      "Mazraoui and Dorgu are certainties to be rested and that means Kamason can make his debut and it's another start for Amass. Mainoo can play in a deeper midfield role alongside debutant Kone.",
      "Mount and Eriksen offer experience as the No. 10s and there is no need to risk Hojlund, so it's a first start for 17-year-old Obi.",
      "This is the perfect opportunity to give Kamason his first-team debut. He's been brilliant for the U18s this season and deserves the chance to start against Brentford in the absence of Mazraoui.",
      "It doesn't make much sense to rotate Onana, so he should retain his starting role in between the sticks, and Amad should make his first start since recovering from an ankle injury.",
      "Mount has been limited to substitute appearances and should also start this afternoon.",
      "Despite having one foot in the Europa League final, nothing can be taken for granted ahead of Thursday night's second leg at Old Trafford, meaning if I was Amorim, I would make wholesale changes in order to keep key players fresh and give them a breather so soon after the win in Bilbao.",
      "Despite not covering himself in glory at Newcastle, Bayindir should come in to replace Onana. The back-three ahead of him ought to feature a first start since April 1 for De Ligt after he came on against Athletic.",

      "It is often said that good things come in threes, and that was definitely the case for Manchester United at the San Mames Stadium on Thursday night.",
      "Not only did they take a huge stride towards the Europa League final, beating Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in the first leg of their semi-final showdown, but they also welcomed Matthijs de Ligt and Amad back from ankle injuries.",
      "De Ligt, who replaced Harry Maguire after 65 minutes, had missed the last six games and Amad had been unavailable for almost three months. He got six minutes under his belt, replacing Patrick Dorgu late on.",
      "By the time both players had stepped onto the pitch, the contest was as good as over. United's three-goal blast in the last 15 minutes of the first half had put the contest beyond Athletic, who will travel to Old Trafford next week facing the steepest of uphill struggles.",
      "But before United and head coach Ruben Amorim can give any thought to the return leg with the Spanish outfit, they must navigate their way through Sunday's Premier League clash with Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. Just like last weekend's trip to Bournemouth, it feels like another meaningless away day.",
      "However, given the tight turnaround time between the trip to Bilbao and the trip to the capital, the clash with the Bees is likely to be a big occasion for some of United's fringe players and youngsters.",
      "Despite taking a 3-0 aggregate lead into next week's second leg with Athletic, Amorim should be wrapping the vast majority of his main men in cotton wool on Sunday and saving them for the main event four days later. It has already been confirmed Noussair Mazraoui will play no part.",
      "The likelihood of Amorim rotating his pack will almost certainly see the likes of Harry Amass, Luke Shaw, Christian Eriksen, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount drafted into the starting XI. There is also a chance that De Ligt and Amad will start after making their returns via the bench in the Basque Country.",
      "Amad was a strong contender for the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award prior to his injury, excelling following Amorim's appointment as head coach in November; his first 20 appearances under him yielded six goals and six assists.",
      "With United currently looking a strong bet to reach the Europa League final, Amad will want to play his way back into contention for a regular starting berth. He will only strengthen those aspirations by playing.",
      "If he is fit enough to start on Sunday, it would be no surprise to see him start as the right-sided No.10. After initially operating at wing-back under Amorim, he was moved into a more advanced role to give United a left-footed presence in that area.",
      "With Amad potentially taking the right-sided No.10 spot, Mount could be in line to occupy the opposite berth. He is yet to find any sort of rhythm since recovering from his latest injury, meaning Amorim, who is a huge fan of his, should give him the opportunity to try and flex his muscles against the team he has scored his only United goal against.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund led United's attack in Bilbao and, in Amorim's opinion, had his best game since he replaced Erik ten Hag. He is the club's only available striker for the Europa League amid Joshua Zirkzee's absence through injury and Chido Obi's ineligibility, meaning he should be rested against the Bees.",
      "With that in mind, there has never been a better opportunity for Amorim to give United's fans what they have been waiting for and give Obi his full debut. The talented 17-year-old has made six substitute appearances since making his debut in February, with his last two cameos in the Premier League amounting to 35 minutes.",
      "The youngster has been excellent for the Under-18s this term and has looked sharp when given opportunities from the bench by Amorim, meaning he has worked his way into a position where he is ready to secure his first start in senior football.",
      "The prospect of him leading the line and being supported by Amad and Mount would, of course, mark the birth of a previously unseen United attack, but it would be one worthy of experimenting with with the pressure off.",
      "United supporters are drooling over Obi's potential, while they have also been wowed by Amad's improvements under Amorim. With full focus on the second part of the Europa League semi-final, Amorim can afford to play around this weekend."

      "Mastantuono made his senior debut in January 2024 and he then became the club's youngest ever goal-scorer the following month. The teenager has promptly established himself as a firm fixture in the first-team set-up, and made 41 appearances throughout his maiden season.",
      "He has since continued to shine in 2025, having netted three times in 12 matches this year. And Mastantuono, who is claimed to be attracting interest from across Europe, saw his stock rise even further when he netted a superb 30-yard free-kick for River against arch-rivals Boca Juniors on Sunday.",
      "United are understood to be interested in snapping-up Mastantuono and he could prove to be an astute addition as Amorim tries to strengthen his squad this summer.",
      "MEN says: Mastantuono is one of the most talented South American youngsters around, right now, and it's no surprise that he has been linked with a summer move to Europe. He has been excellent in the Argentine Primera Division and it does feel like an astute piece of business if United can get a deal done.",
      "Would £38million be too much? For a player of his potential and for one that hasn't played outside of Argentina? Perhaps, but that is the type of money you've got to pay now for an elite talent, who also has the potential to be world-class. Should United get into the Champions League, it's a move that could be worth the risk.",
      "United are hoping to get between £34million and £43million in order to sell Antony this summer, according to El Chiringuito TV.",
      "The Brazil star, who has spent the second half of the season on loan at Real Betis, has scored six goals and added four assists in 19 matches since joining the La Liga club.",
      "Although Betis want to sign Antony on a permanent deal at the end of the season, they could be priced out of a move. That is because United want in the region of £34million to £43milllion to sanction his exit.",
      "And as Betis might not be able to afford Antony, fellow La Liga outfit Atletico Madrid are reported to be \"in pole position\" and it's claimed that Diego Simeone's side have \"asked\" about the 25-year-old.",
      "MEN says: Antony has been excellent since his move to Real Betis and it's a not a shock that Manuel Pellegrini's side want to sign him on a permanent deal. While Betis might not be able to afford him, there are clubs across Europe and Spain that could, such as Atletico. As he has proved that he can perform in La Liga, it's a transfer that Atletico should attempt to make, as he would strengthen their forward line.",
      "Looking at this from United's point of view and their lack of potency across the front three, it would be simple to suggest that he could come back and replicate a similar level of performances, but I think that the Reds should cut their losses and cash in on the Brazil international."

His performance was one of a vastly experienced player who has won most of football's top prizes, making it easy to understand why Ugarte, who is nine years his junior, was so complimentary about his midfield compatriot.",
      "\"I'm learning a lot with Case,\" Ugarte told reporters. \"I have very good relations with Case. I try to copy as much as I can, all the good things that he has as a player.",
      "\"And not only inside the pitch, but outside the pitch too. These are things that make you win, because he's a winner. I feel very comfortable.",
      "\"I speak a lot with Casemiro, and up until now I keep learning and I'm very happy.\"",
      "To win any European trophy, a team must be able to rely on individuals with big-match experience and a winning mindset. Casemiro's nine-year spell at Real Madrid instilled both of those understated qualities.",
      "Whether or not Casemiro has a future at Old Trafford beyond the end of this season remains to be seen, with the midfielder having just one year left on his contract.",
      "Nevertheless, for however long he still has at United, Ugarte's eagerness to try and learn as much as possible from him is fully understandable. As difficult as the Brazilian has found life in the Premier League over the last 18 months or so, he still has plenty of class and qualities to offer.",
      "Ugarte could not have really asked for a better mentor to learn from."

      "Spurs, who themselves have endured a terrible season in the Premier League, are currently 3-1 up against the Norwegian side. Ange Postecoglou's men raced into a 3-0 lead but Bodo/Glimt added some nerves in north London with a late consolation meaning the tie was far from over.",

      "Fortunately, United have their own advantage and it may come as a shock. Casemiro's resurgence in recent weeks has made Amorim's job so much easier with the Brazilian improving drastically. Against Bilbao, the midfielder was brilliant, adding a goal to his all-round performance.",
      "\"I think Casemiro was brilliant tonight,\" Harry Maguire told MUTV after the win. \"I definitely believe he was the Man of the Match. He was everywhere and he scored a crucial goal as well.",

      "It isn't the first time that Casemiro has been applauded for his performances in Spain. In the game against Real Sociedad earlier this season, he performed well, and of course, his time at Real Madrid saw him become one of Europe's best defensive midfielders.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, United paid £70million for his services and throughout his time in England, he's been slammed and criticised for not being at the required level. Recently, he has performed when needed and his track record of performing in Spain could give United an advantage over Spurs in a potential Europa League final."

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reportedly exploring a sale of the French Ligue 1 side OGC Nice that he owns through his INEOS company. For United, that could be impactful.",
      "Back in 2019, INEOS acquired Nice for the sum of £89m (€100m), with the club's fans initially hopeful that through the financial muscle of the firm and British billionaire Ratcliffe they would be able to become genuine contenders in a domestic league that has become totally dominated by Paris Saint-Germain in recent years.",
      "But it hasn’t panned out that way, with Nice having failed to finish above fifth in the six years under INEOS’ stewardship, with one of their best campaigns coming during a period when the firm had to take a back seat in terms of hands-on ownership due to UEFA rules around competing clubs in European competition being under the same ownership. The other club in that case was, of course, Manchester United.",
      "But Ratcliffe’s comments on the club in recent months have angered some of the Nice faithful, with the 72-year-old telling The Times: “I don’t particularly enjoy going to watch Nice because there are some good players, but the level of football is not high enough for me to get excited.",
      "“The best season that Nice has had is this one, where we’ve not been allowed to get involved because of multi-club ownership rules. They’ve been so much better without our interference! Maybe there’s a lesson there as well, you know.”",
      "This week saw multiple reports claim that Ratcliffe was ready to sell the club for £200m, his patience and interest looking to have waned in the project. There is rumoured interest from Saudi Arabian consortia.",
      "It will be the latest in a list of high-profile sporting exits that INEOS has made after they ended commercial deals early with New Zealand Rugby and Tottenham Hotspur, while last month the company announced that they would not be entering the INEOS Britannia sailing vessel into the next America’s Cup. That followed a rather bitter, and very public, falling out with legendary British Olympian Sir Ben Ainslie, who had been part of the INEOS team.",
      "The optics on so many exits haven’t been great, especially with the backdrop of controversial decisions taken at Manchester United, including the shedding of hundreds of jobs, with the team having underperformed even since the 27.7% stake that Ratcliffe acquired in December 2023, a move that saw the owning Glazer family hand over control when it came to football matters and strategy, including the building of a new 100,000 seater stadium on land adjacent to Old Trafford.",
      "But the Nice sale shouldn’t be a surprise.",
      "While Ratcliffe’s recent comments hardly point to an ownership with deep commitment and interest, the current state of play for top tier clubs in France is deeply concerning from a financial point of view.",
      "Pre-pandemic, French football struck a major broadcast deal with Mediapro for €814m (£695m) per year over four years. That was in 2020 and represented the biggest deal that Ligue 1 had ever had, one that was set raise the bar for the competition and move them closer to the likes of the Bundesliga and La Liga when it came to broadcast revenues.",
      "But months into the deal, and with clubs having already committed money that they were expecting from it, Mediapro’s succession of missed payments saw the partnership end, with Ligue 1 bringing in temporary solutions with the likes of Amazon Prime Video at a far lower fee.",
      "The most recent broadcaster has been DAZN, but last month it was announced that DAZN would be exiting the agreement at the end of this season, and with limited interest at the price point desired, the league opted to become its own broadcaster with its own streaming platform. The problem with that is that requires significant capital investment to get it off the ground, and clubs were told not to include broadcast revenue in their financial projections for 2025/26. For some clubs that equates to more than half of the total revenue.",
      "With seemingly little chance of a major return long-term, and with focus having very clearly shifted to what they want to do at United, with Ratcliffe very much ‘all in’ on making the project a success, selling Nice would make some sense, particularly if INEOS can achieve double the price paid.",
      "That money could be directed the way of plans for United, potentially funding some of the development of a new stadium.",
      "Ratcliffe and INEOS have reduced their sporting interests, and while the optics of that might not be great from the outside looking in, it does display a heightened sense of commitment that they are serious about making the investment with the club pay off."

      "Alejandro Garnacho did some eye-catching attacking work in this game and posed the Athletic defence plenty of problems, but it was the defensive side of his game that impressed at one point as well.",
      "United were in danger of being caught on the break in the 25th minute and a wide ball from Nico Williams was pulled back to the edge of the area and into a promising attacking position.",
      "But it was a backtracking United body who was there to intercept in a defensive midfield role, taking control of the ball, turning and then drawing a foul to kill the pressure dead. It was the kind of position and defensive work you would expect of Manuel Ugarte or Casemiro, but instead it was Garnacho in the unusual position, showing the work rate and commitment to the team.",
      "It was another example of how the forward's attitude and approach has changed since he was dropped alongside Marcus Rashford in mid-December.",
      "Hojlund deserves credit",
      "Had Rasmus Hojlund not had an arm laid on him by Athletic defender Dani Vivian then perhaps he would have slid in and converted Noussair Mazraoui's cross. Instead, Hojlund felt the touch, realised his chances of connecting had been harmed and went down.",
      "Not only that, he did something that is becoming key in modern football, and that was to protest forcefully to the officials. Vivian tried to explain to Hojlund that contact had been minimal, but Hojlund's animated insistence that he had fouled could have caught the eye of the officials.",
      "In the VAR era it's important that players show an official how strongly they feel about a decision, which also allows time for the game to stop and for the decision to be checked. We saw in the second half how quickly the game restarted when it looked like Garnacho had been on the end of a similar foul in the box.",
      "Hojlund's complaints made sure the officials knew they had to have a look and his anger would have convinced them that the contact had been strong enough to truly impede him and stop him from making contact. It seemed minor, but he deserves credit.",
      "Bournemouth lessons",
      "There was a clear criticism of the players there, pointing out that his team weren't ready and weren't prepared for Bournemouth starting quickly, despite it being pointed out to the squad pre-match.",
      "Athletic were always going to start this game quickly, but given the Cherries manager Andoni Iraola is a former Athletic great and had said he would be speaking to their current boss Ernesto Valverde about United, you could guarantee exploiting United's slow starts would have been a subject they touched upon.",
      "It wasn't faultless from United. Manuel Ugarte was sloppy in possession in the early stages and they presented Athletic with some promising openings, but they emerged unscathed and then struck ruthlessly up the other end."

      "Atletico Madrid have enquired about Antony's availability, according to reports in Spain.",
      "The Brazilian has found a new lease of life in LaLiga after joining Real Betis on loan during the January transfer window. Antony has been a standout performer, impressing to the point that Betis are now keen to make the move permanent.",
      "Betis sporting director Manu Fajardo has already dropped a major transfer hint about the 25-year-old. \"It is a source of satisfaction on a personal level [to have brought Antony to Real Betis], but it is the result of teamwork,\" he said.",
      "\"Although I am responsible for the sporting management, there are many people involved in this signing. It’s still early, but we will try in different ways to do everything possible to continue enjoying Antony.\"",
      "Manager Manuel Pellegrini also voiced his satisfaction with the winger. \"I see Antony very involved in the team, in the group, in the institution,\" Pellegrini said. \"We would all be happy if he stayed, but now we have to focus on the present.\"",
      "But it now appears that Antony has caught the eye of Atletico. Speaking to El Chiringuito TV, journalist Marco Benito confirmed the interest.",
      "\"Atletico have set their sights on a Brazilian winger as well. They told me that they have their eye on Antony, a player currently at Betis, on loan from Manchester United.",
      "\"I'm also told that United would be willing to sell him for a fee of between €40m-€50million (£34m-£42m) and that Atletico have already enquired about him.\"",
      "Antony’s future at Old Trafford remains uncertain beyond the summer, with head coach Ruben Amorim expected to make a decision upon his return.",
      "When questioned about his plans for loan players, Amorim said: \"All the players that are on loan, they will return and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",
      "\"The talent of [Marcus] Rashford, even Antony [at Real Betis], they have talent. They have to put that on the team. We are really happy because if you put one player on loan, the best thing for us is for them to perform and they are performing.\"",
      "With that said, MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the options United could request in exchange.",
      "Rodrigo De Paul",
      "According to Spanish outlet Relevo, Atletico Madrid have decided to entertain offers for Rodrigo De Paul this summer. Contract talks between the club and the midfielder have reportedly stalled in recent weeks, following strong links to a Premier League move during the January transfer window.",
      "As he is approaching the final year of his contract, it makes sense for the LaLiga outfit to look to cash in this summer. At Old Trafford, Christian Eriksen is coming to the end of his contract while there is also speculation over Casemiro's future.",
      "Antoine Griezmann",
      "He may be a surprise option, but the Frenchman has seen his role diminish under Diego Simeone this season. Despite starting 27 LaLiga matches, he hasn't scored since early February, when he netted in a 2-0 victory over Mallorca.",
      "Cadena Ser have detailed that this could be Griezmann's final season in Madrid after four years. They state Los Colchoneros could look to offload the 34-year-old to avoid losing him for free next year.",
      "Reinildo Mandava",
      "Persistent injury issues have limited Luke Shaw to just seven appearances across the Premier League and Europa League this season. As a result, United could look to strengthen that position ahead of next season, with Reinildo Mandava - a reliable performer for Atlético Madrid - expected to be available this summer.",
      "Mundo Deportivo have claimed he will 'almost certainly' be moving on after falling down the pecking order in recent months. The 31-year-old has been at the Wanda Metropolitano since 2022 and has 102 appearances to date.",

      "Despite this, both sets of supporters might argue that pride is the only thing at stake for United and Tottenham in the Premier League. Both teams have had disappointing league campaigns, with United languishing in 14th place and Spurs faring even worse, sitting just two positions above the relegation zone.",
      "Managers Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou can breathe easy knowing that relegation is not a concern for their teams. Instead, their season's success will hinge on their performances in Europe, with the lofty expectation to make it through to the final and triumph in the Basque region looming over them.",
      "United appear to have a tighter hold on their semi-final ambitions, especially with the advantageous prospect of playing the second leg at home.",
      "Conversely, Bodo/Glimt's captain Ulrik Saltnes netted a late goal to carry some hope into next Thursday's meeting with Tottenham. Spurs must brace themselves for a chilly excursion to the Arctic Circle to seal their progress."

      "Antony has rediscovered his Ajax form that convinced United to splash £85million on him, and it presents an opportunity for Ruben Amorim's men to bolster their transfer kitty for the summer. However, Betis have recently made a formal approach to United to re-sign Antony on another loan until the end of the 2025/26 season, an offer United are thought to have rejected.",

I think important moments will come, and we'll see later.\"",

That meant some academy graduates unlikely to be involved in Europe but in with a chance of playing against Brentford will travel, ready to train on Friday.",
      "That's why 17-year-old striker Chido Obi, ineligible for the Europa League this season, continued to train with the first team. He could yet get a first start for the club at the Gtech Community Stadium. Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also trained, and if they don't feature in Spain, they look likely to play on Sunday.",
      "Three players chasing a potential United debut were also involved and might have their eye on being part of events in West London. Jaydan Kamason, 18, Bendito Mantato, 17, and Sekou Kone, 19, were all involved on Wednesday, which suggests they will travel with the first team.",
      "Amorim watches Collyer",
      "Toby Collyer came out well before the rest of the first-team squad as he continued his rehab from a muscle injury with an individual session with a fitness coach.",
      "The 21-year-old went through a series of high-intensity running and mobility drills as he worked his way back to fitness, having missed a month of action with the injury.",
      "Collyer was beginning to catch Amorim's eye before his injury, and it was interesting that when the head coach emerged before the start of the session, he walked well out of his way to check in on Collyer and see how he was getting on.",
      "Key men return",
      "There was plenty of high jinks at the start of training as the players gathered in the sun and the whole group waited at the side of the pitch for everyone to arrive. Captain Bruno Fernandes was the last man out.",
      "The squad then lined up on either side to create a tunnel for returning players Matthijs de Ligt and Amad to run through, while their teammates tried to slap them on the back and head on the way.",
      "The ritual has become a regular one at Carrington. It is handed out to players returning from injury and those celebrating significant club and country milestones.",
      "Wednesday certainly felt like a big day, with the return of two vital players to Amorim's squad.",
      "Unlucky Amass",
      "The majority of the opening training session again involved the rondo drills. The players were split into two groups, with two from each group going into the middle to try to win the ball. The rest of them tried to keep possession and count their passes at the same time.",
      "There is always lots of laughter as the games progress, with mistakes or interceptions drawing cheers. In one group, it was the turn of 18-year-old Amass to get some grief. One attempted pass was greeted with cries of \"unlucky Amass\" from several colleagues. It certainly showed that the teenager is now settled into that group.",
      "Not so hot",
      "The sun was baking down on Carrington on Wednesday morning, and the sprinklers kept the pitches slick - and occasionally soaked the media in attendance.",
      "But while the Brits revelled in unseasonal temperatures, the arrival of Amorim and his staff was a reminder that this is perfectly standard a little further south.",
      "Amorim and his assistant Carlos Fernandes both came in full tracksuit tops and bottoms, before Amorim eventually shed the top and went to short sleeves. Fernandes kept his on.",
      "But first-team coach Adelio Candido seemed to be feeling a chill that nobody else could detect. He went through the training session with his coat still on."

      "This weekend marks one of the biggest weekends in the football calendar - the Manchester derby. It’s the penultimate league game of the season and United and City will be battling out for a possible Champions League place at Old Trafford on Sunday lunchtime.",
      "City will be going into the derby with a double injury boost, and hoping to challenge United to third place going into the final day of the season on May 10.",
      "More than 30,000 tickets have already been sold for Sunday’s derby, and we look at the latest WSL news from both sides of Manchester ahead of the box office event",
      "United last night made it even harder for themselves to qualify for next season’s Champions League. Their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea not only gifted the visitors the title, but it took United a step further away from UWCL qualification.",
      "However, United goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce continued to be performing between the sticks as she pulled off a huge triple save just shy of the hour mark to keep the score at 0-0.",
      "Marc Skinner’s side could have achieved qualification on Wednesday night if they beat Chelsea, however a 75th minute goal from Lucy Bronze sealed all three points for Chelsea and gave them the title.",
      "It was the final game at Leigh Sports Village of the season for United, and the club gave thanks and a commemorative frame to much-loved goalkeeping coach Ian Willcock who will be leaving United at the end of the season.",
      "Skinner’s side remain third in the table, and a point against Manchester City next time out would mathematically ensure a second top-three WSL finish in the space of three seasons.",
      "Nick Cushing’s side were boosted by the return of Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood following months out with injury during their 1-0 win over Leicester City",
      "It took until the 70th minute for the deadlock to be broken. Leicester, unbeaten on home soil since November, continued to press for a route back into the game, but City held on to close the gap on the WSL top three to four points.",
      "Jess Park scored the only goal as City came away with all three points.",
      "Hemp and Greenwood’s return comes at a vital time for City as they challenge their closest rivals for the final European spot as they head into the derby on Sunday.",
      "City are four points adrift of United heading into the game and know only a win will keep alive their hopes of qualifying for next season's Women's Champions League",
      "The last derby saw City host the Red Devils in the FA Cup semi-final last month but suffered a 2-0 defeat.",
      "City won’t have the home advantage this time either and United will be hoping Old Trafford brings some luck for the women’s team."

Scott did exceptionally well when she entered in 2022, being crowned the Queen of the Jungle which launched her punditry career after retirement.",
      "While at 25 Toone still has plenty of playing days ahead of her, she has admitted to The Telegraph that she would want to join the ITV show. \"I wanna go on I’m a Celeb. I don’t think I’ll be as good as Jill, who won it, but I’ve always said it,\" she admitted.",
      "\"When I was younger, it was Blue Peter and I’m a Celeb… and Total Wipeout. I did Blue Peter the other day and I was over the moon getting my Blue Peter badge.",

      "\"If I tell you and then I go on it and they make me do it,\" she laughed. \"The drinking challenges… I can’t even swallow a tablet without gagging.\""

      "United head coach Marc Skinner has signed a new contract at Old Trafford to keep him at the club until June 2027, with the option of an extra year. Skinner, 42, has been at United since July 2021, succeeding Casey Stoney.",
      "He has overseen an excellent job so far this season, leading United to third place in the WSL table, boasting the best defensive record in the league in the process. They have, of course, also reached the last four of the FA Cup, meaning their hopes of defending their crown are still very much alive.",
      "Taking charge of 119 games thus far, Skinner boasts a win ratio of almost 65 per cent. His side has only lost three games this season across all competitions.",
      "\"It has been an absolute privilege to serve as head coach for this fantastic football club for the past four years, and I am delighted to be extending my time in the role for at least a further two years,\" Skinner told United's club website.",

They are currently third in the WSL table, only behind second-placed Arsenal on goal difference, with just four games left to play.",
      "Following the agony of their Champions League quarter-final exit at the hands of Chelsea last Thursday night, City got back to winning ways last weekend, beating Brighton & Hove Albion 2-1 at Crawley Town's Broadfield Stadium.",
      "City took a 2-0 lead into the second leg of their aforementioned quarter-final showdown but found themselves 3-0 down by half-time, meaning they were eliminated 3-2 on aggregate. However, interim boss Nick Cushing saw his side bounce back at the first available opportunity, scooping all three points via goals from Kerstin Casparij and Vivianne Miedema.",
      "Casparij fired City in front shortly before half-time when she gambled on connecting with Mary Fowler's low cross and turning the ball home from the edge of the six-yard box. However, the Blues were made to work hard for all three points and eventually doubled their lead in the 90th minute through Miedema, who blasted the ball home after Kerolin's cross was headed directly into her path.",
      "Brighton, though, set up a tense finish by getting themselves on the scoresheet just two minutes later when Charlize Rule swept the ball home from inside the box after City failed to clear a corner.",
      "Reviewing his side's victory, Cushing said: \"After a very tense period, and a hugely competitive period against Chelsea, in the three competitions we played - the three points was the main objective today and I thought we played well in patches.",

Their ambition extends beyond league success; they have also secured a spot in the FA Cup semi-finals and are set to square off against City in an away fixture next week.",

      "With a pivotal summer transfer window ahead, Amorim has drawn up a shortlist that includes at least two new strikers, a wing-back, and a central midfielder.",
      "Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap and Wolves forward Matheus Cunha are understood to be his primary striker targets. However, both pursuits present challenges.",
      "Delap, whose £30 million relegation release clause has caught the attention of several Premier League clubs, is in high demand.",

      "Arteta and Art class…\nHaving attended Art class, I found Andy H, Swansea’s entry fairly persuasive, but I have to reject one of his premises, i.e., that Arsenal were a “pratfalling mess” when Mikel Arteta arrived.",
      "I think that Andy’s assessment of Arteta’s performance is reasonably fair in itself, but Arsene Wenger’s final league finish was sixth, not fourteenth or seventeenth. A team finishing sixth in any EPL season is hardly a team doing pratfalls. They were a club with a legendary manager who led the Invincibles and transformed English football…which, in return, grew beyond him.",
      "They had plenty of talent when Arteta arrived, if some of it had been misused. They were in no sense a mess; they just needed a new coach. Maybe they needed one a couple of years earlier, but I don’t really know, as I’m not Stewie Griffin*. Arteta has improved them, no doubt, but he hardly applied CPR.",
      "I deleted a whole nostalgic paragraph about having driven for two and a half hours to see Newcastle lose an FA Cup final and Why I Don’t Hate Arsenal, but I was only belabouring things.",
      "On the other hand, five and a half years of watching Mikel Arteta at Arsenal have taught me to detest Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. I have Mailbox form here, as it were, and won’t belabour my beef either, though I will repeat that I always liked him as a player.",
      "But the fact remains that, whatever his failings, Arteta is at the very least a good coach who can really nail it against an opponent like Real Madrid once in a while. He has beaten a lot of good coaches, whatever his transfer market failures. If I were an Arsenal supporter, I think I’d be ambivalent. The wrong upgrade could be disastrous.",
      "Perhaps handing over a bit of transfer control would benefit him. Maybe he should be telling the board and Director what he wants, not who he wants, and let the scouts, the stattos and Edu go find it.",
      "All that said, my club’s won exactly one real pot in my 30 years of support, and it still feels like yesterday. Fans of some clubs think it’s an utter shambles, a travesty of justice, the end of the world when their club don’t win at least one trophy in any given season. It’s beyond me. My expectations just aren’t calibrated the way “big club” supporters I read here or in the socials.",
      "And no offense to those Gunners, but I hope they never will be. It seems to steal a lot of joy. My philosophy has always been that losing is part of sport; if you don’t know losing, what do you really know? (Besides winning, obvs.)",

That’s pretty good, Man City were very slightly better over 38 games so they won the league. We all know Man City have been an unprecedented level of dominance in the league since well before Arteta joined Arsenal for various sporting reasons – even ignoring the 115 stuff they are strongest club by far.",
      "This season has not gone as well, not just for Arsenal but for quite a few other “big” clubs. Despite all our “Shitness”, we are still the second best team in the league and I think that gets under some folk’s skin.",
      "Anyway, regarding not winning anything – here is the exhaustive list of managers who have won competitions Arteta has not. I am excluding domestic cups and European competitions apart from the Champions League because they don’t count in these conversations. Winning an FA Cup would not change people’s position – “ah but he can’t win the league” etc…besides, just ask Ten Hag or David Moyes whether these comps are enough to keep your job on their own. Critics like to tout the cups as a stick to beat Arteta but would not allow winning them as a defense. They are very nice though but small beer apparently – so onwards!",

      "Rio Ferdinand\nI don’t really like Rio Ferdinand on comms, for many reasons but you can’t question his talent as footballer. An absolute Rolls Royce of a defender. He played alongside Vidic? Yep, and they complemented each other perfectly. Rio was the best centre back of the noughties in the Premier League (lots of fashionable foreign defenders then too). Better on the ball and still less of a bellend than John Terry. He’d be equally lauded today as then if he was playing now. Ball playing centre backs are not a modern phenomenon either (Bobby Moore?). If I didn’t support United I’d say Van Dijk was better (almost as if you combined Vidic and Rio) but I do so I’ll stick by my man.",
      "I also completely agree with J. Nicholson about the embarrassment of United and Spurs pissing the Europa League. But it’s UEFA that should be embarrassed. It all started when they let runners up join the Champions League (literally adding losers ruins the name a bit). What we have now is a European Super League by stealth supported by two lesser European competitions which act as a safety net for teams like United who struggle to qualify the proper way. Much like VAR, we can never go back.",
      "And finally, there is so much nuance to some of the issues that are constantly debated in these hallowed pages and that affect our wonderful game. That nuance is above the heads of at least 50% of people that we end up in situations where trans people have nowhere to play football (or any sport really) and a young(ish) black woman loses her job for “clumsy” comments about an important issue. Aluko was wrong about Wright (I think) but the men’s game has been hostile to women (it was men that banned it for fifty years so fight me) and there is a representational imbalance which has been ignored in the fallout.\nAshmundo",
      "",
      "Let’s get this out of the way first; Rio is an absolutely diabolical pundit/co-commentator. I actually muttered “f**k’s sake…” when they announced he’d “made his way up to the gantry” 2 minutes into the game last night.",
      "However, Hartley in the Mailbox needs to go and wash his mouth out with soap and water for questioning him as a player. I’ve seen lots of great centre backs at United, from Bruce and Pallister, to Stam and Johnsen and then Vidic and Rio. Rio was the best of the lot and it’s not particularly close. Tall, quick, strong, great on the ball; I’d argue he’s the best centre back in Premier League history. Unfortunately, he became injury prone around 30 which is when centre halves often get the most plaudits.",
      "I’d argue he’s criminally underrated, and any United fan that knows their onions will tell you Rio covered up for Vidic, not the other way round. Vidic got mountains of praise because he’d throw himself in front of anything and came across as a warrior for the fans. That’s why he was loved. Rio did “merks” and missed drug tests, and generally came across as a bit of a knob.",
      "As was referenced elsewhere in the mailbox, likability is a really important factor in shaping public opinion, and no one really likes Rio, myself included, but you need to separate the man from the player. He was an absolutely top tier defender. See also, Terry, John.\nLewis, Busby Way",

      "Harry Maguire \nHarry Maguire. This man has been run through the mill.",
      "For quite a few years, he was (and still often is) lambasted in the press/social media.",
      "He has made one mistake along this whole way, and that was the Greece debacle. No one knows what actually happened other than those actually present, so its hard to give a view either way. Perhaps best to say he might have been better off getting away from it all before it kicked off, but who knows. Alcohol and youth often exacerbate things, I certainly cant throw stones from my glass house on that one.",
      "From a football perspective, he’s played the game as best he can. He can’t do any more than that. People slag him for being slow ….. well that’s just him, it’s not his fault – some guy paying £80m for you doesn’t suddenly make you run faster. But – he’s given it his all every time he steps on the pitch. He’s faced the criticism head-on and come back stronger, accepting his weaknesses. He’s accepted a new system under this new manager, knuckled down and got on with it. And for that, I tip my hat and say well played, kudos to him. Seeing him score the winner against Lyon, and then dicking all over the Bilbao fullback like a top end winger was a pleasure, and I couldnt be happier for the guy. If half the Man Utd squad had the bollocks and spine that he had, the club would be in a far better position than it currently is.",
      "A little aside on Hartley MCFC. I agree Rio is by no means the greatest commentator/pundit in the modern game. But to use that as a reason to start questioning his ability as a footballer during his career, is a little ridiculous, no? I mean, Sir Alex Ferguson, one of the greatest managers of all time, saw fit to go and get him and make him the heart of his defence for 12 years. But yeah, you’re probably more likely to be right than Fergie, eh?\nBen, London (Aluko – why pick Ian Wright, pretty much the most loved-by-all sides man in football?)",

      "As a United fan, I’m ecstatic. But I’m also worried that Amorim’s pattern of using the wing is pretty predictable. Our lack of a clinical striker is another matter. I am grateful to witness a glimmer of hope this season but I’m hoping this charade ends this season.\nVictor",
      "",
      "Check mate…\nWith Spurs’ shambles of a season almost at an end, I think it’s safe to say that Ange is not going to be around next season regardless of any potential trophy success. So now that they’re almost guaranteed to make the Europa League final, Daniel Levy has the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever.\nSanjit (Mourinho-ed) Randhawa, Kuala Lumpur.",
      "",
      "Transwomen debate\nCan Dan, Plastic LFC, explain why biological men should be allowed to play in women’s football? It’s a genuine question, because I can’t think of one good reason.

Transitioning and then wanting the same rights as women is very much a case of wanting to have your cake and eat it.\nG Thomas",

      "Former Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick has labelled the club “significantly worse” since his tenure and the massive spend which has taken place in that time.",
      "Rangnick spent a short spell at Old Trafford during the 2021/22 season as caretaker boss. He won 1.45 points per game, which is not a very impressive feat, while he suggested the club needed “open-heart surgery” to fix some problems.",
      "Since then, United have spent huge money but gone backwards, something not lost on Rangnick.",
      "“In the end. That a few basic things need to be changed and since then 700 or if not £750m has been spent on new players. And in the table they are even significantly worse than back then,” he told Canal + Austria.",
      "“They could actually, with a win in the Europa League, still save this season. Because then they will be in the Champions League.",
      "“Everything else would be a disappointment, and it will be interesting to see what will happen. They have signed a coach in the middle of the season who plays with a three or a five-back, and the squad was built based on a four-back system.",
      "“This is what you see when you see them play, especially in Premier League games against the opponents against which Manchester United normally has to win.",
      "“Sure, in the Europa League, they have – usually with the result against Lyon, you are eliminated – they have turned it around. And of course, the stadium had a huge effect.”",
      "In the summer window prior to the 2024/25 season, United splashed around £180million, and followed that up with a spend of another £25million or so in the January window, Ruben Amorim’s first since taking over from Erik ten Hag.",
      "But they have been in the bottom half of the Premier League for almost the entire season, currently sitting 14th. The end of Rangnick’s season at the helm saw United finish sixth, which was only the third time they’d finished that low in eight years.",
      "While the Austrian’s spell at the club was not a particularly good one, things have clearly gone from bad to worse.",
      "United have been linked with some big names in the summer, and they’ll need some of those signings to get back to competing in the top half of the league."

      "Man Utd have had an offer for Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez rejected as the Catalan giants tell them how much they need to pay, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils are having an awful season with Man Utd moving back up above Everton into 14th after their 1-1 draw against Bournemouth.",
      "Amorim’s side are already guaranteed to go down as the worst Man Utd side to have played in the Premier League era, even if they win their final four matches.",
      "Red Devils boss Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, has struggled to get his players to adapt to his playing style, philosophy and tactics since arriving.",
      "And with results also failing to come, there could be building pressure on the Portuguese head coach heading into the summer, especially if he fails to guide them to Europa League glory.",
      "Man Utd, who beat Athletic Bilbao 3-0 in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final, are unlikely to sack Amorim whatever happens before the summer as they plan on backing him in the summer transfer market.",
      "And the Portuguese head coach is looking to improve his midfield and now reports in Spain have claimed that Man Utd have made a €30m (£26m) ‘offer’ to sign Barcelona’s Fermin.",
      "Despite interest from several clubs around Europe, it is understood that Man Utd are ‘the first to make a move’ but ‘the Blaugrana leadership’s response has been emphatic: no talks for less than €50m (£43m) are contemplated.’",
      "Man Utd ’emissaries’ took ‘advantage of the trip to Spain’ to face Athletic Bilbao and ‘proposed a meeting to discuss the details’ of a potential deal for Fermin – but the Catalan giants ‘told them that if the bid didn’t start above 50 million euros, there was no need to travel to Barcelona’.",
      "Despite Barcelona’s ‘fragile financial situation’, Joan Laporta is staying strong on his asking price with Man Utd now knowing what it will take to ‘close the deal’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Fermin, who emerged through the Barca youth system and gained experience on loan at Linares, has made it clear that his priority is to stay at the Camp Nou.",
      "‘He recently renewed his contract until 2029 and his only intention is to see out his contract. His attitude, commitment, and performance have resonated with both the coaching staff and the fans.",
      "‘But the club is no stranger to the financial situation and knows that any significant income will be key to complying with the financial fair play requirements imposed by LaLiga.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘sent an offer’ to FC Barcelona regarding a possible summer transfer and this bid has ‘divided opinion’.",
      "Liverpool are the preferred transfer destination for Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Xavi is looking to take two Barcelona players with him to Man Utd if the Red Devils decide to sack Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Premier League giants Chelsea have submitted an ‘offer’ to FC Barcelona and have ‘asked’ for the availability of two players.",
      "Man Utd are ‘serious about signing’ Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Barcelona midfielder Fermin Lopez was the subject of strong interest from Man Utd and Aston Villa during the January transfer window, according to reports."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has put a hugely limiting restriction on the players he wants the club to sign this summer, adding to the already ‘strict rules’ put in place by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS ahead of the major squad surgery required to prevent the Red Devils from further embarrassing themselves next season.",
      "Here are five players who ‘won’t come’ to United this summer on the basis of this new rule set out by Amorim and the five which worked perfectly for them in Ratcliffe’s first window with his hand on the tiller.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres\n“I didn’t talk to him,” Ruben Amorim said when asked about United’s links with Gyokeres.”But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.”",
      "We don’t know whether Amorim believes United should be exempt from the key factor which has governed which clubs top players choose to sign for over the last two decades, but if he thinks Gyokeres is somehow abnormal for wanting to play Champions League football then he’s gravely mistaken. He’s the most deadly goalscorer in Europe.",
      "It would be great if the strength and veracity of this Amorim belief could be put to the test with a phone call to Gyokeres before and after United win the Europa League final and gain entry into the Champions League next season, with the striker’s flip-flop met with contempt and a snub by his former manager in favour of a much worse striker who wanted to join no matter what.",
      "",
      "Jonathan Tah\nWith all due respect to our wonderful news editor and headline whizz Joe Williams, we’re not sure many Manchester United fans will have clicked on a link with any hope of the Red Devils pulling off the signing of Tah having read ‘Man Utd ‘actively consider’ free transfer ahead of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona’.",
      "You can ‘consider’ as much as you want, lads. That’s a four-club battle you’re not winning. Nor should they be battling in the first place. Free transfer or not, the Germany international breaks the primary golden rule set out by INEOS of not signing players over the age of 25. He’s 29 until he’s 30 in February.",
      "",
      "Patrick Schick\n‘The manager will be asked what position he wants to sign, not what player,’ the rules report claimed, and Amorim has flouted not just that directive but another by suggesting they sign 29-year-old Schick.",
      "Amorim has had the gall to ask whether the United bosses would be willing to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ to sign the Bayer Leverkusen striker as an alternative should they miss out on Liam Delap, rather than waiting for his list of three strikers to choose from, passed down from the recruitment geniuses who bought a striker last summer who’s scored seven goals in 48 appearances.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen\nA triple whammy of rule breaks here we suspect. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said he didn’t want any ‘Galacticos’, making quite the assumption that Manchester United still have the clout to sign such players. But then again, a sojourn in the Turkish league (no disrespect) may have given United cause to believe Osimhen – whom we reckon can just about be classed as a ‘Galactico’ – would be open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "But they don’t want those top tier stars, likely because of their wage demands as much as anything, with some reports suggesting Osimhen wants as much as £400,000 per week from his next club. He’s also 26 and surely has designs on Champions League football.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha\nWe can’t wait for the look on their faces when they realise 25-year-old ‘done deal’ Cunha turns 26 five days before the transfer window opens.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed that Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte were “nervous” before their Europa League clash against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Arsenal are leading the race for Manchester United-linked Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, according to reports in Portugal.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked a question which he answered while Liverpool are also pulled into the narrative as Federico Chiesa involved…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has given his view on whether Viktor Gyokeres could be tempted to move from Sporting CP to Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly asked INEOS to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ at Man Utd to sign a ‘budget-friendly’ alternative to Ipswich’s Liam Delap.",
      "Including Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim, here are nine examples of managerial bullets being dodged by Premier League bosses."

      "READ: Mediawatch: Arsenal face ‘nightmare’ of needing to beat Southampton for Champions League place",

      "The Red Devils produced a good performance to take command of the tie with Bruno Fernandes scoring a brace after Casemiro’s early opener.",
      "Bilbao were the better side early on but Casemiro’s header after lovely work from Harry Maguire on the right, changed the complexion of the match.",

When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 12 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black.",
      "",
      "2) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +2.9\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 73.8% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "3) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.7\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "4) Kepa (Bournemouth): +2.6\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +2.4\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "8) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "9) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +2.3\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",

      "",
      "12) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.9\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",
      "",
      "13) Alisson (Liverpool): +0.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more.",
      "",
      "14) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.3\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "15) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "16) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -1.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Andre Onana this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",

      "One advantage United have over Ange Postecoglou’s side is that the final will be played on the ground they so emphatically triumphed on Thursday night. And while Bilbao shot themselves in the foot with a first-half red card, Amorim’s men deserved the win and showed up when it truly mattered.",
      "This United team have been saving their best football for Thursday nights under Amorim, and a 3-0 win against a side who only tend to lose to very good teams (and Girona), and who had only lost twice by two or more goals all season before this, is no small feat.",
      "United started brightly but could easily have gone behind when Inaki Williams headed over with the freedom of Andre Onana’s box. The elder Williams brother had an alarming amount of space and really ought to score, with the Red Devils defence once again playing musical statues.",
      "That was the first let-off involving Williams, whose low cross was poorly dealt with by Victor Lindelof – but thankfully, the Swede was on hand to clear Alex Berenguer’s shot off the line from his own weak clearance.",

      "Patrick Dorgu’s speed on the opposite flank was also causing problems. Oscar de Marcos resorted to pushing the young wing-back over during a foot race he had absolutely no chance of winning at one point.",
      "Both teams looked dangerous in their own right, but just before the half-hour mark, United struck first. There were a few unlikely heroes for Amorim in what was a genuinely hilarious goal.",
      "Flying right-winger Harry Maguire was twisting and turning like a prime Arjen Robben, and his cross was reminiscent of a prime David Beckham. It was expertly turned goalward by Manuel Ugarte, whose header found Casemiro at the back post to nod in. Seriously, it was bloody brilliant from Maguire. Unironically sensational.",
      "United looked to build rather than sit, and soon had VAR checking for a penalty. Noussair Mazraoui’s beautiful low cross was dealt with woefully by Dani Vivian, who felt compelled to hold back Rasmus Hojlund rather than let him shoot – an act that seemed daft even without hindsight given Hojlund’s goal record this season.",
      "We were thinking that even before the referee brandished a red card and Bruno Fernandes stepped up to score the penalty. It turns out letting Hojlund shoot definitely was the right thing to do. Bloody hell…Vivian is supposed to be the young one in that back four.",
      "Two players were sacrificed three minutes before half-time as Ernesto Valverde desperately tried to make sure his side were still in the tie for next week’s second leg in Manchester.",
      "Unfortunately for him, Amorim’s men had enough time for a third before the break. Captain Fernandes was on hand again, calmly slotting home one-on-one with Julen Agirrezabala. Not even Manchester United can mess it up from here, right?",
      "Mazraoui struck the crossbar with a beautiful left-footed effort shortly before the half-time whistle, which came at a rubbish time for a United side in full flow.",
      "That was all she wrote in terms of goals, and taking a three-goal lead back to Old Trafford is mightily impressive. We wouldn’t be surprised if United c*ck this up, but even by their standards, that would be something special.",
      "Bottling this semi-final would officially be funnier than winning the whole thing and stumbling into the Champions League. But honestly, both are extremely amusing outcomes. The important thing is: we can’t lose from here.",

      "Only four Premier League sides have scored fewer goals than Man Utd this season and Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have taken a lot of criticism for their lack of goals.",
      "Hojlund scored only his fourth Premier League goal of the season in their 1-1 draw against Bournemouth on Sunday, while Zirkzee has only contributed three.",

      "A potential transfer for Gyokeres has gained momentum in recent days with rumours about a potential ‘done deal’ for the Sporting CP striker.",
      "When asked if he wants a ‘project’ striker like Gyokeres or a more experienced player to help the current forwards at Old Trafford, Amorim replied: “Our focus is to help our players that we have. Rasmus scored one goal in the last game.",
      "“Again, I think you can see that Rasmus has the talent, Josh has the talent, Chido has the talent. We have to improve the players, but to improve the players individually we have to improve the way that we perform, the way we play.",
      "“We are far from being a really consistent team that can help the strikers to score many goals. We have a clear lack of goals and that has cost us a lot of points this season, we have to improve that [play] to help the strikers to improve.”",

      "Man Utd beat Lyon in an incredible comeback which saw Amorim’s side score three times in extra time to progress to the semi-finals of the Champions League.",
      "When asked what the comeback win has done for his side’s confidence, the Man Utd boss responded: “I think it’s more a club thing. Everybody knows when you play in Old Trafford, something special can happen, but then in the next game against Wolves we create a lot of situations and we didn’t score and that confidence came down a little bit.",
      "“This season is a little bit like that. We are always searching for a great moment that can change a lot of things. We just need to be consistent. But it was a great night. In this kind of season, sometimes you have these special moments that you can take and in these kind of games, you can use that to fuel the players to do something more special.”",
      "On Athletic Bilbao, who they play in their Europa League semi-final on Thursday, Amorim continued: “I think they have a lot of good things. I’m not going to talk about the bad things, but they are really strong as a team, they are really intense, they are really aggressive.",
      "“Even for a Spanish team, they are really aggressive on every duel. They have great players one against one. Nico Williams is a special player. They are the best defence in Spain in the league and we are not scoring too many goals so it’s going to be a tough match for us.",
      "“We know that in the beginning of the game, 20-30 minutes especially, they are really strong and intense and use the crowd to take the game to a different level and we are prepared for that, so we are going to face a very strong team.”",

      "Marcus Rashford has one ‘great goal’ this summer and both he and Manchester United are reportedly willing to take a financial hit in order to make it happen.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and managed four goals and six assists in a largely impressive spell before picking up a hamstring injury which looks set to rule him out for the rest of the campaign.",
      "Earlier this week, a report claimed Man Utd and Aston Villa are currently ‘in talks’ over whether to end his loan early.",
      "‘Rashford knows there is unlikely to be any future for him at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim, so the Red Devils will listen to offers. And he plans to sit down with his employers before mid-June.",
      "‘Yet he may be forced to return earlier than expected if the two clubs agree as there is no prospect of him recovering inside three weeks. That comes in spite of Villa holding a £40m buy option for Rashford as part of their loan agreement with United.",
      "‘Rashford is said to be undecided on his future as things stand and will have the final say on where he plays next season.’",
      "Rashford is desperate to play Champions League football next season and even though Aston Villa are still in with a decent chance of finishing in the top five and qualifying, the England international appears to have made up his mind not to join the Villans.",
      "Unai Emery’s side hold a £40m option to make his loan permanent at the end of the season, but the move won’t happen without Rashford’s say-so, and the forward only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are paying 75 per cent of.",
      "Rashford though has told Barcelona that he’s willing to take a significant pay-cut in order to make the move happen.",
      "A report from Spanish outlet SPORT states:",
      "‘His great goal is to try to play for Barça and his environment has already sent to the Blaugrana leaders that he is willing to lower his salary ostensibly so that the operation can be viable from an economic point of view. Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.’",
      "It’s also claimed that United are willing to lower their demands to get Rashford off their books, dropping their £40m asking price to €35m (£30m).",
      "But there’s doubt as to whether Barcelona will take up the option, as a new forward is not a priority despite Hansi Flick admiring Rashford’s qualities.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Rashford’s main problem is his salary because United is willing to sell for a maximum of 35 million euros, a figure only understandable due to the distance between the club and the footballer. United’s idea is to sell it and save the contract it has signed until 2028. The English star is one of the highest paid footballers in the Premier League and that has made many clubs retreat due to the final amount of the operation.",
      "‘But Rashford is very clear that in the case of Barça he would press to lower the transfer or even force a loan and would put everything on his side with a salary reduction that could make him affordable for the Blaugrana club. The striker was already clear in the January negotiations that, sportingly, he fit for Barça but that the financial problems of the Blaugrana club were an insurmountable barrier.",
      "‘In Barça they have taken note, but there is no decision about it. Both the sports management and Hansi Flick appreciate Rashford’s talent, his physical power and his offensive versatility, but today it is not a priority to sign another attacker, although there is debate. The club understands that it will be possible to sign although with great economic caution and they would be advancing in other positions that would be more necessary. Everything is open because there may also be exits that will end up enlivening the market at Camp Nou.",
      "‘In fact, the sports management has detected that a good number of top-class stars are offering to play at Barça, something that has not been so common in recent years. Flick is building a winning project and Barça is now an attraction for many footballers. Deco and Flick will have a lot to choose from but the goal more to sign will be to retain the block to continue moving forward in the future.’"

      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly asked INEOS to ‘go against their transfer strategy’ at Manchester United in order to sign a ‘budget-friendly’ alternative to Ipswich’s Liam Delap.",
      "The Red Devils travel to take on Athletic Club in the first leg of their semi-final on Thursday, with victory over them and then either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt in the final resulting in silverware and entry into the Champions League next season.",
      "Qualification for Europe’s showpiece competition will be crucial both in attracting top players to join the club and in order to have the budget required to sign them, but even so, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS penny-pinchers won’t be handing Amorim a huge pot of cash to perform what needs to be significant surgery on the squad this summer.",
      "With that in mind they’ve been heavily linked with a move for Delap, who’s impressed for Ipswich with 12 Premier League goals despite their relegation this season, in their bid to sign an alternative to goal-shy pair Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Ipswich’s relegation means Delap’s release clause is set at just £30m, a very reasonable price for a player of his quality.",
      "But that reasonable price has predictably led multiple Premier League clubs to be linked with the 22-year-old, including Chelsea and Newcastle, whose competition for his signature has led United to consider alternatives.",
      "They’re thought to be admirers of Eintracht Frankfurt talisman Hugo Ekitike and Napoli’s Victor Osimhen, but respective £85m and £60m price tags are likely beyond United’s means, with their salaries also thought to be providing a significant obstacle.",
      "They could instead move for Bayer Leverkusen’s Patrik Schick as a ‘budget-friendly solution’, although a move for the striker – who has two years left on his contract – would mean INEOS having to break their recruitment rules.",
      "A report from GIVEMESPORT claims United believe Schick has been identified as an ‘attainable alterantive to Delap’, though may also face competition for his signature with Real Madrid also circling around the striker, who has a price tag of around £34m.",
      "United have been attracted by ‘Schick’s experience and proven record in front of goal’ with the Czech international scoring 79 goals in 165 Bayer Leverkusen appearances.",
      "He’s seen as a ‘budget-friendly solution’ if they can’t land Delap, but it’s added that United would be ‘going against their transfer strategy’ if they did sign the 29-year-old, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS making clear their desire to sign young talent whose value can increase at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim has added more transfer restrictions to the ‘strict rules’ put in place by Sir Jim Ratcliffe which will prevent many Manchester United signings.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed that Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte were “nervous” before their Europa League clash against Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim was asked a question which he answered while Liverpool are also pulled into the narrative as Federico Chiesa involved…",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has given his view on whether Viktor Gyokeres could be tempted to move from Sporting CP to Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "Including Arne Slot, Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim, here are nine examples of managerial bullets being dodged by Premier League bosses.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s insistence on forcing players to play a style that doesn’t suit them is “starting to become a major concern”, according to a Man Utd insider."

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",

      "United were three up at half-time after breaching Europe's tightest home defence at the Estadio de San Mames, where the LaLiga side hadn't lost since August.",
      "It took something special to unlock Athletic Club when Harry Maguire momentarily turned into a winger, showing quick feet on the right before crossing into the near post for Manuel Ugarte, who flicked the ball on for Casemiro to head home the opener in the 30th minute.",
      "Athletic Club: Agirrezabala (6); De Marcos (5), Vivian (3), Alvarez (5), Berchiche (5); Jauregizar (5), Galarreta (5); I. Williams (5), Berenguer (5), N.

      "The entire tie changed within seven minutes after Rasmus Hojlund was pulled back by Dani Vivian when he tried to reach a low cross in the six-yard box. The referee sent the Athletic Club centre-back off and awarded United a penalty, which Fernandes cooly dispatched, after consulting the pitchside monitor.",
      "Athletic Club made two substitutions to try and halt United's momentum, but Fernandes added a third before the half was finished, slotting home from Ugarte's clever backheel to put the visitors in dreamland.",
      "United eased off in the second half with a controlled performance to prevent the hosts from finding anyway back into the tie.",
      "Casemiro went close to his second of the night, hitting a post with a header at a corner before Fernandes and Garnacho both had shots parried by goalkeeper Julen Agirrezabala.",

      "His side became only the third to win at San Mames since August and inflicted the joint-biggest defeat on their hosts at the stadium in over a decade, putting one foot in the Europa League final at the same stadium later this month - where they look likely to meet Premier League rivals Tottenham.",
      "United weathered an early storm from the hosts but took the lead through Casemiro's header, and then played much of the game with a man advantage after centre-back Dani Vivian conceded a penalty and was sent off for pulling back Rasmus Hojlund in his own box.",
      "Despite scoring three goals in the final 15 minutes of the opening period, the one criticism of the visitors' performance was that they did not manage to add to their advantage and kill off the tie as a contest.",
      "Man Utd are the only remaining team unbeaten in Europe this season, in stark contrast to their Premier League campaign where they have lost 15 of 34 league games - but even so, the head coach had not been expecting such an emphatic victory in the Basque country.",
      "\"It's the best result because nobody expected this result,\" he said. \"But you saw two games today - the first 25 minutes and then, after the goal and the sending-off, the game changed.",
      "\"In the second half, we tried to be cautious and we created chances but the most important thing is the opponent didn't get many shots on our goal.",
      "\"We've improved in the last games. I don't look just at the results. We had some games that we won that we didn't play well and some games we lost but played well. Sometimes you need a little bit of luck.",
      "\"In the first 30 minutes, they had chances to score. If they score, it's a different game. When we scored, we felt more free to play.",
      "\"It's hard to understand but sometimes it's the context. We can win this competition. In the Premier League, we are suffering game after game. We try to manage both things with some injuries. Sometimes it's hard, even for the players.\"",

      "Of 133 previous first-leg away wins by three goals in European knock-out ties, all 133 teams have progressed to the next round.",
      "Hojlund could not add to the last-gasp equaliser he netted at Bournemouth at the weekend but did put in a strong shift leading the line for United, proving an agile target man while also showing far better positional awareness than he has in recent games.",
      "Amorim has kept faith with the beleaguered striker through his prolonged struggles this season, in part due to a lack of senior alternatives, and gave him a vote of confidence following his performance in Thursday's game.",
      "\"It was the best game he had with me as coach,\" he said. \"He helped the team a lot. He secured the ball and made runs. It was a good moment for him but like Harry (Maguire) he needs to understand everything can change so let's focus on the next one. This one is in the past.\""

      "Tah, who has been free to negotiate with foreign clubs since January, said: \"To be honest, I don't have a timeframe. But the club knows about it. And it's been the same as it has been all along.\"",

      "Manchester United take on Athletic Club in Bilbao to kick off a two-legged Europa League semi-final in a competition that provides the club's remaining chance of silverware this season; Alejandro Garnacho remains adamant that Man Utd are still eyeing major honours",
      "Thursday 1 May 2025 19:46, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has admitted winning the Europa League will not make the season a success but could provide a platform for the future.",
      "United travel to Bilbao on Thursday for the first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Athletic Club.",
      "The competition remains the club's only chance of winning silverware after a dismal competitive campaign. United will record their worst-ever Premier League points return come the end of the season and sit 14th in the top flight.",
      "Should United stay in 14th, it will be their worst top-flight finishing position since the club were relegated in 1974. However, despite the club's second-ever Europa League trophy being up for grabs, for Mainoo, the disappointment of their league displays will linger.",
      "\"It'll definitely give hope for us to take something positive into next season. The season's not gone how we would have liked it to, but we can't just be down and all fall apart, because then where do we end up? We have to stay together and keep a spirit, because there are still big games to be played.\"",
      "His team-mate Alejandro Garnacho echoed Mainoo's thoughts, explaining the opportunity to be in the Champions League remains a big one for the club.",
      "\"It's a big stage for all the teams and all the players, but as Kobbie said, it's not going to be a great season if we win the Europa League, because in the league we are bad. But obviously it will help the club, and also for us to win a trophy and be in the Champions League. We'll try to do it.\"",
      "Despite an underwhelming campaign, Garnacho is still eyeing major honours, with the Europa League building upon past success.",
      "\"Last season we won the FA Cup, the season before the Carabao Cup, now we're in the semi-finals of the Europa League,\" Garnacho said.",
      "\"But, at the end of the day, the big titles are the Premier League and the Champions League, so we want to fight for these. It will take time, but we will try as soon as possible.",
      "\"We don't care about the position we are in now, we will try to win every game. Sometimes it's more difficult, but we always go to the game believing. If the game is today, then we will have to win today.\""
