      "Ruben Amorim has reiterated that Manchester United will not break the 88-year record of always having a homegrown player involved every matchday squad. Teenage midfielder Jack Fletcher has come in for their match against Tottenham Hotspur to keep the streak going in the absence of Kobbie Mainoo through a minor injury.",
      "The sequence dates back to 1937 and stretches over 4,000 consecutive matches. Players satisfy the club's requirements so long as they did not play for anyone else's first-team before joining the club aged 20 or younger, and going on to play for one of their academy sides.",
      "Fletcher joined United two years ago from Manchester City alongside his twin brother Jack. Both players are the sons of Darren Fletcher, who currently serves as the lead coach of the club's under-18s after previously working with the first team and holding the position of technical director.",
      "\"We are not going to stop with this and these academy players. It doesn't matter the result; it doesn't matter anything else.",
      "\"We need to continue with these small details that are the foundation of our club. We have that record; we are not going to break that record, and Jack is ready to help us.",
      "\"We do two things together - to show people that our academy is also our future and to also show that the players need to be ready, because we are going to need them at some point.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been warned he must expect some time among the substitutes by Ruben Amorim. The Manchester United boss has revealed the Red Devils' captain will be rotated if the club have European games on their schedule next season.",
      "Fernandes has scarcely missed a minute in the opening 10 Premier League matches this season. The Portugal international remains an integral part of Amorim's plans, despite playing a deeper role than he has been accustomed to at Old Trafford, owing to the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, and Benjamin Sesko into United's front three.",
      "Fernandes has missed just three matches for United through injury or illness across more than five years at the club - making a habit of being available since arriving at Old Trafford. In the entirety of last season, the midfielder featured in all but three games for the club.",
      "But, if United are to be successful, Amorim has warned his 31-year-old star player that he must get used to some time among the substitutes. An increase in games means the head coach will have to manage his squad more effectively.",
      "“We have one game per week, he’s always available,\" said Amorim",
      "“It’s really hard. We have good things on that, to play just one game, but then there’s a lot of players that should be playing, should be dividing the minutes, should be fighting for their places in a different way. But we don’t have the space.",
      "“So I’m not thinking about now the rotation of the players. In the future, yes, is something that Bruno needs to understand. If you want to win every game that you are a part, with European games, is going to have to rotate.",
      "“So good question, just for Bruno to put in his head, that maybe next year he’s going to be in rotation in the team.”",
      "Fernandes has kept Kobbie Mainoo out of the side this season, with Amorim viewing the pair as in competition. Mainoo has played 138 minutes in the Premier League and spent most of his time on the bench this season.",
      "The young midfielder is unavailable to face Tottenham after picking up an injury, but has been linked with a loan move in January. Mainoo's absence put United's remarkable 88-year record of including an academy player in their squad at risk.",
      "Amorim has placed 18-year-old Jack Fletcher among his substitutes, however. Fletcher is son of ex-United star Darren Fletcher.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United's tradition of bringing talent through their ranks and backing them has seen them boast an academy player in every matchday squad for 88 years. A period spanning 4,332 successive games.",
      "It was uncertain whether that figure would notch up another after Kobbie Mainoo went down injured ahead of United's Premier League clash against Tottenham. The England international has helped keep the record alive this season, and for the previous four games, was the only academy graduate in United's squad.",
      "But Fletcher, 18, was included in the travelling party that made its way down to London and has even made the matchday squad. The England youth international has not made his first-team debut for United, but was on the first-team bench more than once last season.",
      "Fletcher and his twin brother, Tyler, joined United from Manchester City's academy in 2023. Goalkeeper Tom Heaton would have been another option to keep the record alive after coming through the academy, but Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir have been preferred.",
      "United classifies a homegrown player as one who signed for the club before the age of 21 and has not played for another senior team. They must also have played for a junior team at United.",
      "Amorim recently said he would not be the coach who broke United's longstanding record. The Portuguese coach has kept his word so far.",
      "The United boss has kept faith with a midfield combination of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, with Fletcher still facing competition on the bench from Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount to make his debut.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is also among the substitutes against Spurs with Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha making up the front three. Amorim makes three changes to his starting line-up following the draw with Nottingham Forest as Harry Maguire, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu come into the team.",
      "Manchester United XI: Lammens; Mazraoui, De Ligt, Maguire, Shaw, Dorgu, Fernandes, Casemiro, Amad, Mbeumo, Cunha.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side travel to north London in stellar form, having last lost a league match in late September. They've beaten Chelsea and rivals Liverpool already this season after a rocky start.",
      "The manager will be without academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo for this trip after he picked up a minor injury. Mainoo hasn't travelled with the squad, putting an 88-year record at risk. Since 1937, in a total of 4,332 matches, United have always fielded an academy player in their matchday side. With Mainoo absent, there is no recognised graduate in their midst.",
      "However, this boast could be saved by young Fletcher, who is an academy prospect and was pictured heading down to London with the senior squad. The teenager has evidently impressed for the under-21s and he has a twin brother who is also a star in the making.",
      "Both Jack and his twin brother Tyler signed their first professional contracts with United in April 2024. The duo followed in their superstar father's footsteps, as Darren was scouted by United aged 11 and progressed through the ranks to play 342 times for them.",
      "Darren was born near Edinburgh and represented Scotland at international level. But one of his sons has decided to go in a different direction.",
      "Both Tyler and Jack began their youth careers at Manchester City before moving to the red half of Manchester in 2023 for a fee of £1.25m.",
      "Since then, both have gone on to impress and despite being just 18, the pair are already regulars for the under-21 side, managed by Travis Binnion.",
      "In March, they linked up in an under-21s match against West Brom, with Jack scoring two goals, both of which were assisted by his twin brother Tyler. Darren has even worked with his sons at youth level and is currently the club's under-18s coach.",
      "When it comes to national teams however, the twins differ. Jack has so far chosen to represent England and even captained the under-18s earlier this year.",
      "Tyler has chosen to emulate his father and currently plays for Scotland's youth setup having previously featured for England. He was the captain of a Scotland under-19 side that played Poland in March.",
      "In 2023, both brothers lined up against one another when England's under-16s played against Scotland. England came away the victors 3-0.",
      "Now, it is Jack who looks set to achieve a brilliant milestone and be named in United's senior squad for their early Saturday kick-off against Tottenham. Just last month, he grabbed an assist when United's under-21 side faced Spurs, beating them 4-1.",

His development at Crystal Palace has witnessed him establish himself as one of the brightest prospects in his position, securing a spot in the England setup and drawing attention from numerous elite European sides.",
      "Earlier reports indicate Ruben Amorim holds Wharton in considerable esteem, though the midfielder stays completely committed to his duties at Palace. He has four years left on his existing contract at Selhurst Park, after an £18 million switch to south London from Blackburn Rovers in 2024.",
      "Speaking to The Athletic, Wharton addressed the rumours directly.",

      "\"United, the big teams, they're all linked to 10, 20 different players. If I'm one of 20, then it's nothing special, so it doesn't really mean too much. I speak with my agent about planning ahead and possibilities.",

      "The Red Devils face Tottenham in the capital on Saturday lunchtime but will be without Mainoo, who has often been on the bench for them this season. It is a setback for the homegrown talent, but his absence leaves a major hole in the squad for Ruben Amorim.",
      "United's tradition of backing their own talent has seen them boast an academy player in every matchday squad for 88 years. That is an incredible statistic that spans 4,332 successive games. Mainoo's injury has put that in jeopardy.",
      "It remains to be seen if Ruben Amorim will bring in a homegrown talent simply to keep the record going but he has prepared for that. Youngster Jack Fletcher, the son of former player Darren Fletcher is just 18, but is in the travelling party for the trip down south and could yet find himself a spot on the bench.",
      "This season Mainoo has been the only academy graduate who is regularly part of the first-team picture. Young defender Tyler Fredricson has picked up one appearance, that coming in the Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby.",
      "United's options are limited with Marcus Rashford heading out on loan to Barcelona this summer. Jonny Evans, whilst a veteran defender, was on their books last season and was another homegrown talent. This term Amorim has allowed a lot of their young players to head out on loan.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov has leapt to the defence of Kobbie Mainoo, who is going through a \"really cruel\" period at Manchester United with Ruben Amorim opting against playing the young midfielder, who was also denied a move away.",
      "Mainoo was once seen as an untouchable at Old Trafford and looked destined to dictate play in the midfield for the next decade and beyond. Under Amorim though he's been very much a squad player and is yet to start in the Premier League this term.",
      "The United boss has preferred a midfield duo of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, leaving Mainoo to watch on from the bench. The 20-year-old is now out of the England fold having had limited chances to impress this season.",
      "There was talk of a loan move to Napoli in the summer, but that was blocked, yet Amorim has made minimal use of Mainoo. Berbatov feels sympathy for the young player but admitted Amorim \"doesn't see something he can use\" from the start.",
      "He told the Daily Mail: \"It's a very tough situation, especially for a young player. And it shows you how football can be a really cruel game at times because Kobbie Mainoo was playing, he reached the England national team, he was going up, up, and up. All of a sudden he is not being picked.",
      "\"Now the question is, does he stay positive, patient, and wait for his moment again? Or he needs to move to a different place to play regularly to get his confidence back and come back to United and start playing more regularly?",
      "\"I'd like to see him play because the talent is there to see, that decision-making, that calmness and arrogance which you need with the ball at your feet is there, even at his age. I like that. But at the moment, the manager doesn't see something he can use from the first minute of the game.\"",
      "The hype and interest around Mainoo, who had been regarded as the best academy product to come into the first-team for years, has seen Amorim regularly questioned on why his minutes are so limited. The United boss has been keen to point out how much improvement he still wants to see from the youngster.",
      "Mainoo's CV already boasts a goal in an FA Cup final win and a start in the final of the last Euros, but since Erik ten Hag's exit from Manchester his fortunes have dwindled and talk of a sale has ramped up, particularly because of the profit he would recoup when it came to PSR.",

As the two Premier League giants prepare to face each other on Saturday afternoon, fans may well be reminded of the speech Ferguson made during the fixture in 2001.",
      "Both Keane and Scholes played in the iconic match where the Red Devils found themselves 3-0 down at halftime to Spurs in a shocking turn of events. When Ferguson came into the dressing room, he reportedly said simply: \"Lads, it's Tottenham.\"",
      "United came back in the second-half and won 5-3 so the short but sweet team talk definitely worked. However, Scholes didn't feel like it was fair for the legendary manager to discredit their opponents the way he did.",
      "\"We knew that most of the time we had the beating of Tottenham. We were always confident against them. I know there’s a lot said of, ‘It’s only Tottenham’ and that should be enough to win a game. But it isn’t. You’re playing against a very good team of footballers.",
      "\"They’ve had the upper hand against United, we’ve lost the last three. It’s not quite ‘just Tottenham’ any more.\"",
      "Scholes was right not to underestimate Spurs that night as United watched on as Ange Postecoglou's side lift their first European troph since 1984. However, not everyone felt that Ferguson's words weren't the right fit for Spurs back in 2001.",
      "Former club captain Keane was full of praise for Ferguson's words at the time, claiming the Scot knew exactly what the team needed to hear. Speaking at an event for his book, The Second Half, he said: \"I played under good managers, bad managers.",
      "\"The top managers get a feel for the group, they know what you need. Whatever Alex Ferguson’s strengths and weaknesses, that was by far his biggest strength.\"",
      "Highlighting the famous speech, Keane added: \"It was Tottenham at home. I thought, ‘please don’t go on about Tottenham, we all know what Tottenham is about, they are nice and tidy but we’ll f****** do them’.",
      "“He came in and said: ‘Lads, it’s Tottenham.’ And that was it. Brilliant. It could have been a European semi-final, it could have been Leeds away, it could have been a home League Cup tie – Alex Ferguson always had a feel of the group.\"",
      "While both ex-Premier League stars disagreed over Ferguson's iconic speech, they'll both be rooting for United to get a priceless away win against Spurs this weekend.",

The Red Devils may have a lighter fixture list than usual this season, but plenty of work will be going on behind the scenes to ensure the club have the right squad to secure a return to European football.",
      "Ruben Amorim is making the most of United not having midweek cup games and has guided his team to a four-game unbeaten run. However, the lack of matches has meant the United boss has been unable to give some of his squad players a way to force their way back into the team.",
      "Amorim has admitted that he expects some United stars will ask for a move away from Old Trafford in January. Two of those who have been struggling for game time are Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is reportedly a target for Roma following his struggles to nail down a place in the United team. The arrival of three new forwards in the summer has pushed Zirkzee further down the pecking order, restricting him to just 90 minutes of action across five substitute appearances.",
      "The 24-year-old is also claimed to have attracted interest from West Ham, but the forward is said to have doubts about joining the Hammers. Alternatively, Sport Witness reports that Roma have offered United the chance to sign striker Artem Dovbyk as part of a swap deal with Zirkzee.",
      "The report explains that United are not interested in signing Dovbyk, who has registered two goals and two assists in 13 appearances this season. However, Roma are attempting to agree a favourable deal for a player who is currently out of favour at Old Trafford.",
      "It is claimed that the Italian side would prefer a loan deal for Zirkzee, who was signed from Bologna last summer. Meanwhile, Zirkzee's main focus will be on increasing his minutes to earn a place in the Netherlands squad for the upcoming World Cup.",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that Kobbie Mainoo's positive approach to training has been noted. However, the United boss confessed that the 20-year-old midfielder still faces an uphill battle to regain his place in the team.",
      "Amorim has favoured the midfield pivot of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes this season, reducing Mainoo to 138 minutes of Premier League action. Amorim has explained that United's early Carabao Cup exit and lack of European football have not helped Mainoo's cause.",
      "The England international previously requested to leave on loan in the summer. He was part of the Three Lions squad that reached the Euro 2024 final, but has not featured under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "\"I see Kobbie Mainoo training today, and he deserves to play, but then I have to take one guy that is playing really well,\" Amorim told beIN Sports. \"We should have played yesterday in the Carabao Cup because I need to see Kobbie Mainoo playing.",
      "\"I need to see Joshua, all these guys. They deserve to play, but in the end, with one game, you need to make choices. So, we have both sides, but we are taking advantage of the good side of not playing in the middle of the week.\"",

Frank explored a move for Mbeumo after replacing Ange Postecoglou at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, only for the Cameroon star to opt for United.",
      "Last season, Frank and Mbeumo were two big factors as former club Brentford finished 10th in the league. Mbeumo top-scored with 20 goals, the best single-season return of his career, while Frank shook off the loss of Ivan Toney to secure a comfortable mid-table finish.",
      "Since moving to Old Trafford for up to £71million including add-ons, Mbeumo has established himself as a regular threat. He has five goals from 11 appearances in all competitions, four of those in the league, and his former boss Frank isn't surprised.",
      "\"Of course I'll step out of my role at Tottenham. When you work with a player for six years, you get a close relationship,\" the Danish coach said.. \"To see him develop from being a young man, 19-year-old when he moved to London and Brentford and left six years later, going into one of the biggest clubs in the world with all that focus and the way he stepped up.",
      "\"For me, looking from the outside, maybe a little bit biased, I think he's been their best offensive player. He can create, he can score, he works hard, he's a team player. He's the perfect example, in my opinion, for a player what I call about attitude, confident but humble. He's a top player.\"",

      "Whether or not you agree or disagree with his calls, Thomas Tuchel is pretty much always happy to explain his more contentious selections. And that is exactly what he did when discussing Myles Lewis-Skelly’s omission from the England squad for the upcoming games against Serbia at Wembley and against Albania in Tirana.",
      "He said the Arsenal man “needed more starts, more minutes” and had been “outperformed” by Nico O’Reilly recently. Which is a touch harsh.",
      "Since the last international break - when he started and finished the qualifier in Latvia that confirmed England’s place at World Cup 2026 - Lewis-Skelly has started two games for Arsenal and made three brief appearances as a substitute. Granted, O’Reilly has been eye-catching in recent starts for Manchester City but Lewis-Skelly is hardly out in the cold at the Emirates.",
      "And to be dropped having not done anything wrong in a 5-0 win is a tough one to take, to say the least. Lewis-Skelly has not long turned 19 and will hopefully have a long international career ahead of him but this still comes as setback.",
      "It also puts some focus on the left-sided defensive position. Fitness allowing, Tuchel appears to have plenty of options - and exciting options at that.",
      "Long-term, Tina Livramento is one of those options, as is his Newcastle team-mate Lewis Hall. Djed Spence is in this England squad and is playing well.",
      "So, come next summer, there should be no shortage of quality personnel available in that area. But aside from Lewis-Skelly, the other left-back who can feel unfortunate not be in this latest Tuchel squad is Luke Shaw.",
      "He has been consistently good in recent weeks, is having his best run of fitness for a long time, is versatile, and, of course, has a decent international pedigree, even though his tally of 30 caps reflects those injury issues.",
      "While 30-year-old Shaw has started every Premier League game for Manchester United this season, he has had a couple of low points, most notably when he was heavily criticised for his performance against City in the derby in mid-September.",
      "But he has been mainly excellent in United’s four-game unbeaten run and is a more natural left-back than O’Reilly. Elsewhere in the squad, there is very little to quibble over.",
      "The return of Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden is as pleasing as it was predictable and it will be great to see Adam Wharton try and get his England career well and truly started. It should not be a case of whether or not the Crystal Palace midfielder should make the squad for next summer, it is a case of whether or not he should start the first game.",
      "And the call-up for Alex Scott is a nice nod to the notion that an England cap can be a reward for good form, no matter how under the radar your progression in club football has been. So, in general, this is quite a feelgood squad.",
      "But both Lewis-Skelly and Shaw can consider themselves unfortunate not to be part of Tuchel’s latest World Cup planning stage. Because if fit, both will have a compelling case to be at World Cup 2026.",

      "Earlier this week, reports emerged that Bayern were ready to break their own rules to hand Kane a new deal. The club have previously committed to only offering one-year deals to players aged over 30 but are said to be willing to make an exception amid interest from the likes of Barcelona.",
      "A Premier League return has also been mooted. Kane is just 47 goals shy of Alan Shearer's all-time record of 260 goals in the competition, and Simpson believes the England captain would jump at the chance to chase that record with United.",
      "\"I don’t know where else he could go, if I’m honest,\" Simpson told Dream Vegas. \"He can’t go to [Manchester] City. He can’t go to Arsenal. I can’t see him turning Manchester United down.",
      "\"He can come back, and get the goals record. I’d love to see it. I said it when he was leaving Tottenham, I’d love to see him at Manchester United. It’s a good fit. If that’s an option I’d 100% go for it.\"",
      "Simpson hasn't been deterred in his feelings by United's big-spending summer. Benjamin Sesko arrived from RB Leipzig as part of a £200million spree, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo also arriving, and the former defender doesn't see the Slovenia striker's presence as a barrier to a Kane deal.",
      "\"He could help Sesko as well. Sesko would understand not playing every game, learning under Harry Kane, and not having that pressure,\" Simpson added. \"He’s (Kane) won his trophies at Bayern now, so if he comes back and gets Manchester United back up to the top of the Premier League, he could be a Manchester United legend like when [Robin] Van Persie came.\"",
      "Simpson's comments come despite Kane speaking positively about his Bayern future. The striker's 26 league goals last term helped pave the way for a title win, while he has 22 in just 16 appearances this term to help Bayern win all of their fixtures.",
      "\"In terms of staying there longer, I could definitely see that,\" the 32-year-old said in October. \"I have not had those conversations with Bayern yet but if they were to arise I would be willing to talk and have an honest conversation.",
      "\"Obviously, it depends on how the next year or so goes and what we achieve together. Right now, I would say we are in a fantastic moment and I am not thinking about anything else. In terms of the Premier League, I don't know. If you had asked me when I first left to go to Bayern, I would have said for sure I would come back.",
      "\"Now I have been there a couple of years, I would probably say that has gone down a little bit, not so much, but I wouldn't say I would never go back. What I have learnt in my career is that different opportunities and different timings happen and things fall in place. Going back to my first point with Bayern right now, I am fully all in with Bayern.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo believes the Saudi Pro League is a higher standard than France's Ligue 1, but his comments have since backfired following a recent interview with Piers Morgan. The Portugal icon sat down for a candid conversation with the journalist, reflecting on his career and experiences playing in different countries.",
      "The 40-year-old has played in Portugal, England, Spain, Italy and is now in the Middle East. Ronaldo joined Al-Nassr in 2022 after a bitter exit from Manchester United, where he claimed he had 'no respect' for then-manager Erik ten Hag during a controversial interview with Morgan.",
      "Three years on, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has once again sat down with the journalist in his home in Riyadh.",
      "Having scored 952 goals for club and country, he's now aiming to become the first player in history to reach 1,000 before retiring.",
      "He has netted 102 goals for Al-Nassr to date, including nine this season, with his side currently sitting top of the standings. Despite his prolific record, Ronaldo has faced criticism for the his goalscoring feats and has now hit back.",
      "\"It's excuse after excuse. Year after year, I keep scoring more goals. Even in a bad year, I scored 25 goals,\" he began. \"If I were playing in the Premier League now, for a big team, I would score the same as now.",
      "\"I just keep doing my job. I'll repeat it. They don't know what it's like to run in 40 degree heat and I still continue to say, the Saudi League is better than the Portuguese league, obviously, as well as the French League - it's only PSG (Paris Saint-Germain).\"",
      "However, Opta Power Rankings has revealed that the Saudi Pro League ranks significantly below both the Portuguese and French leagues in quality.",
      "The Saudi Pro League is ranked 29th, while Ligue 1 sits fifth and Liga Portugal ninth.",
      "Although Ronaldo has enjoyed his time in Saudi, he echoed the views of many by stating that the English top-flight remains the strongest in world football.",
      "\"The Premier League is good of course, it's the number one,\" the Portuguese star added.",
      "\"They should count like the goals to be the top scorer, the Golden Ball, why don't they count it in the Saudi league? Why? Look how many top players we have in the league, ask the other players if the league is good.",
      "\"Don't ask me because it's easy to ask me, because I'm always at the centre, 'Cristiano say that, because he plays in Saudi.' No, no, listen I played everywhere. Everywhere.",
      "\"For me, it's easier to score in Spain than in Saudi Arabia.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo has been tipped to buy his own football club following his recent dig at his old club Manchester United. The Portuguese megastar has voiced his disappointment over the club's leadership and their inability to restore the Red Devils to their former glory.",
      "In a frank chat with Piers Morgan, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner warned that head coach Ruben Amorim can't single-handedly turn things around. Amorim, a former teammate of Ronaldo in the Portugal national team, acknowledged \"mistakes\" have been made but emphasised the need to concentrate on United's future rather than dwelling on the past.",
      "Speculation has now emerged that Ronaldo's remarks indicate he might be more inclined to buy a football club rather than pursue a managerial career after retiring. The 40-year-old, currently plying his trade for Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, is not exactly strapped for cash, having recently been declared football's first billionaire player by Bloomberg.",
      "Ex-Liverpool strikers Dean Saunders reckons owning a football club would appeal more to Ronaldo as it would offer him greater control than managing a team. Saunders, who has managed Wolves and Wrexham in the past, shared his views on talkSPORT, suggesting Ronaldo grew frustrated with his teammates' attitudes during his second stint at United.",
      "\"I think he'll buy a club because you've then got a bit of control over what happens at the club when you're in charge of it,\" Saunders said. \"But when you're coaching players, you rely on players to make you look good. He relies on himself right now.",
      "\"I don't think he's having a go at Amorim. I know for a fact that he told ex-players that he couldn't believe the attitude of the players he was playing with at Man United.\"",
      "Saunders added: \"If you'd done that in front of Sir Alex Ferguson, you'd never play again. I think he's on about the culture at the club and Amorim is trying to say as well that he needs to get the culture right.\"",
      "Ronaldo has a contract with Al Nassr that runs until summer 2027. He's also expected feature in next year's World Cup as he nears the remarkable milestone of scoring 1,000 career goals.",
      "At the Globe Soccer Awards in December 2024, Ronaldo ruled out a future in coaching. Instead, he hinted at potentially becoming a club owner, but only \"when the right opportunity comes.\"",
      "Ronaldo further elaborated on his ambitions, saying: \"Mark my words, I will be the owner of a big club, for sure.\" He also indicated that he would want to actively improve how a club is run, suggesting that if he ever owned a team like United, he would \"make things clear and adjust what I think is bad there.\"",
      "In a candid chat with Morgan, Ronaldo said of Amorim's tenure at Old Trafford: \"He's doing his best. What are you going to do? Miracles? Miracles is impossible. We say in Portugal, 'miracles is only in Fatima', and he's not going to do miracles.\"",
      "The phrase \"miracle of Fatima\" harks back to the events of October 13, 1917, when it's said that a crowd witnessed the \"Miracle of the Sun\". The tale goes that during this event, the sun seemed to spin, change colours, and plummet towards the earth before returning to its usual position.",
      "When quizzed about Ronaldo's remarks, Amorim said: \"Of course, he knows and he has a huge impact in everything he says. What we need to focus on is the future. We know that we as a club made a lot of mistakes in the past and we are trying to change that. Let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things and want the players to behave. We are doing that and we are improving, so let's continue and forget the past.\"",

      "Manchester United's plans to construct a new 100,000-seater stadium have reportedly hit a snag due to a lack of government funding.",
      "The club revealed their ambitious plans in March, shortly after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who acquired his minority stake in February 2024, expressed his preference for a new-build on the same site as Old Trafford, replacing the historic 115-year-old ground. The Mirror reported that club insiders estimate the cost of a new stadium to be a whopping £2billion.",
      "Ratcliffe was hopeful that the project could be financed in part through the government's Trafford Park regeneration scheme, which has received backing from Chancellor Rachel Reeves. However, according to the i Paper, the Treasury will not allocate any funding for the stadium, with the upcoming Budget expected to focus heavily on tax increases.",
      "Furthermore, United's bid for government funding has allegedly been at a standstill since the beginning of the year. It is said that Treasury officials have held discussions with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority about regeneration and housing plans in the area, but 'no formal engagement' has been made with either United or Trafford Council.",
      "The government has already committed £600million to Greater Manchester for the 2025–26 financial year through an Integrated Settlement with the West Midlands and Greater Manchester Combined Authorities, announced a year ago.",
      "However, it seems that additional funding specifically for the Old Trafford redevelopment is not currently on the cards. United have made it clear they are not seeking public funds for the stadium build itself, estimated to cost between £2bn and £3bn, but government support will be crucial to deliver the broader regeneration plans.",
      "Alongside these delays, United have also been unable to secure the rail freight terminal near Old Trafford, which is needed to commence building work.",
      "The club have put forward £50m for the land, but Freightliner, the owners and operators of the terminal, are holding out for £400m - a price the Reds view as 'unrealistic'.",
      "Last month, it was reported that United have had 'constructive' talks with Freightliner - and are hopeful about reaching an agreement 'within the coming months'. If a deal is struck, United would be able to press ahead with plans, designed by Lord Norman Foster, for a new stadium complex.",
      "A new stadium would bring significant social and economic benefits to the local community, including an estimated 92,000 jobs and over 17,000 new homes.",
      "It's also projected to draw in 1.8m additional visitors, generating a £7.3bn annual boost to the UK economy.",

      "Manchester United are looking to stretch their unbeaten run to five matches when they face Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League this lunchtime.",
      "Here are the teams for today's game:",
      "United: Lammens; Maguire, De Ligt, Shaw; Mazraoui, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Amad; Cunha.",
      "Spurs: Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Spence; Palhinha, Sarr; Simons, Richarlison, Johnson; Kolo Muani.",
      "United drew 2-2 with Nottingham Forest last weekend. Amad's wonderful volley rescued a point for the Reds despite leading at the break.",
      "As for Spurs, they bounced back from a 1-0 defeat at Chelsea last Saturday by thrashing FC Copenhagen in the Champions League. Both teams are level on points heading into the fixture.",
      "Follow all the latest updates from the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in our live blog below:",
      "We are underway and United have won the toss meaning they have turned the home side around",
      "Before today's game, there will be a moment to reflect and remember those who died in World Wars One and Two. In the UK, Remembrance Sunday will be held tomorrow.",
      "Spurs and United players are out at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It is a raucous welcome for the two teams.",
      "The teams will be out shortly here at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. You have to hand it to Spurs, they have got it right with this ground. Fans are close to the action and the steep 'Yellow Wall' inspired stand is superb. When their near neighbours West Ham got it wrong, Spurs have done it right.",
      "Shaw blew a kiss to the stand and waved when he emerged to warm up, so his family must be here to watch him today. United have been warming up for the last 15 minutes or so. Maguire is starting in the centre of the back-three, but that’s not a surprise.",
      "With Mainoo out with a knock, there is an appearance on the bench for youngster Fletcher. Speaking pre-match on TNT Sport, Amorim explained exactly why the midfielder has been included in the squad.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "The Reds were given a warm welcome as they arrived onto the pitch from the travelling United supporters. There is a good feeling between the fans and players at the moment. If they can make it four wins from five matches, that good feeling will only continue.",
      "Speaking to TNT Sport about Fletcher's inclusion, Amorim said:",
      "\"It's really important. I think, again, we are in the moment, if we are going to take some corners to have succeed right away, it's a wrong thing. There are some things, especially in our club, that we need to be bulletproof. It's the way we behave, the way we feel the club, and all these small things, like, we are not going to stop with this, with the academy player.",
      "\"It doesn't matter the results, it doesn't matter anything else, we need to continue with these small details that are the foundations of our club. So, we have that record, we are not going to break that record, and Jack [Fletcher] is ready to help us. So, we put two things together, to show the people that our academy is also our future, to show the players on our Academy they need to be ready, because we are going to need them at some points, and then that Jack is ready to help us.\"",
      "Mainoo did not make the trip to Tottenham yesterday and his absence has now been explained. The midfielder joins Martinez not in the matchday squad.",
      "Read more about his absence here>>>",
      "Dalot really struggled against Nottingham Forest and it’s the right decision to drop him to the bench for this game. Starting Dalot again would have sent the wrong message after a difficult few weeks. The Portugal international is not at his best when he plays on the left, although Dorgu is not a hugely convincing replacement in the team.",
      "United weren't at their best against Nottingham Forest last weekend, so Amorim makes three changes. Dorgu, Maguire and Mazraoui come into the side for Dalot, Yoro and Sesko. Amorim has liked to play with a strikerless front three this season, but it’s been Mount who has been picked to play until this afternoon. Amad will interchange positions with Cunha and Mbeumo. It will probably be Cunha who starts down the middle, but the attack will be fluid.",
      "Here is Spurs' starting XI: Vicario; Porro, Romero, Van de Ven, Spence; Palhinha, Sarr; Xavi, Richarlison, Johnson; Kolo Muani",
      "Subs: Kinsky, Danso, Tel, Udogie, Odobert, Bentancur, Scarlett, Akhamrich, Rowswell",
      "Here is United's starting XI: Lammens; Maguire, De Ligt, Shaw; Mazraoui, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Amad; Cunha",
      "Subs: Bayindir, Dalot, Heaven, Yoro, Mount, Fletcher, Ugarte, Sesko, Zirkzee",
      "The United squad have arrived in the staidum.",
      "It’s possible that Amorim reverts to the striker-less front three this afternoon, which would mean Sesko on the bench in favour of starting Mount. Sesko looked lively in moments last weekend, but he scuffed two chances and failed to find the net, which is ultimately how a striker is judged. I’d personally stick with Sesko, but I would understand the logic in going with Mount. The midfielder is the catalyst for the press when he starts and he combines really well with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Frank has been hugely complimentary of Mbeumo, unsurprisingly after their successful stint working together at Brentford. \"He can create, he can score, he works hard, he's a team player. He's the perfect example, in my opinion, for a player what I call about attitude, confident but humble,” Frank said. \"He's a top player. I think he will have fantastic success there. I hope that for him, not tomorrow, but in general I hope and wish him all the best.\" Mbeumo caused United plenty of headaches when he played for Brentford and fans are relieved he’s now on their side. The Cameroon international has hit the ground running since arriving at Old Trafford. He’s been a wonderful signing and was named the Premier League player of the month for October after three goals and an assist.",
      "Amorim insisted United's focus is on this season following a question about Casemiro's contract.",
      "Casemiro's deal at Old Trafford expires in June but United have a 12-month extension option.",
      "Casemiro has regained his spot in the United starting XI this season, but he is the highest earner in the dressing room and will celebrate his 34th birthday in February.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "United will play Tottenham for the first time since losing in the Europa League final. Postecoglou ended Spurs’ 17-year trophy drought but he was still axed after the game, which was the right decision. Amorim admitted in his pre-match press conference he is fortunate to still have his job, although the decision to back Amorim looks to have paid off after an impressive October. The two teams we will watch today are completely different to the sides that clashed in Bilbao. Only four United players - Shaw, Fernandes, Casemiro and Amad - who started in that game are seen as practically guaranteed starters for this fixture.",
      "It’s my first visit to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium today. Spurs’ new ground is state-of-the-art and regarded as the best in the Premier League, although it does not intimidate visiting teams like White Hart Lane could. I visited White Hart Lane before it was demolished in 2017 and I’m glad it was ticked off my list before Tottenham moved. I’ve been reliably told the food in the press room should be good today, so stay tuned for a potential culinary update.",
      "According to Betfair, United are the favourites to enter the international break five games unbeaten.",
      "Spurs 13/8",
      "Draw 21/10",
      "Man United 5/4",
      "It is a lovely, crisp November day in north London...",
      "The MEN shared the United squad to face Tottenham yesterday and 21 players were spotted travelling down to London. Mainoo has been left behind in Manchester, seemingly with a knock, and Jack Fletcher is set to come into the squad in his absence. Fletcher’s inclusion is important to keep the 88-year record of featuring an academy graduate in every matchday squad alive. United have included an academy graduate in their squad for 4,332 successive games and Amorim does not want to be responsible for breaking that remarkable run. Heaton has also travelled but appears likely to be left out.",
      "If United fans are turning up to Tottenham early, they may choose to take the walk from Seven Sisters to the stadium. Just five minutes into the walk, you will see this rather aptly named butchers on your right.",
      "Martinez does not make the trip down to Spurs today but this will surely make United fans smile.",
      "Spurs are currently sweating on the fitness of one of their summer signings for today's game. Kudus, who signed from West Ham, was described as ‘touch and go’ by Thomas Frank heading into this one.",
      "The Ghanaian has only played three times against United and won two of those games - scoring once in the process. The Reds may hope that he is not in the squad this afternoon.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim believes Sesko has \"struggled a little bit\" since joining the club.",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. The 22-year-old started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Read on here >>>",
      "Should you not be in front of the TV this Saturday don’t worry, we shall provide you with all the updates.",
      "Ahead of this game, we asked our United writers to pick their preferred starting line-ups to take on Spurs. Against Forest, Amorim picked his first unchanged side since taking the job at Old Trafford.",
      "However, our writers don't believe he should make it back-to-back unchanged starting XIs this weekend.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "United’s injury crisis feels like a thing of the past but there could be a couple of absentees today.",
      "Youngster Jack Fletcher has travelled with the matchday squad and could be set for a place on the bench, while Harry Maguire will be hoping to return to the starting XI having missed the win over Brighton and been named as a substitute in the draw with Forest.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez were not spotted travelling with United to London on Friday.",

      "See the squad here >>>",
      "Hello and welcome to our coverage of United’s trip to Tottenham in the Premier League.",
      "This is the Reds’ final match before the November international break. Both Amorim and Mbeumo were honoured by the Premier League this week for their work in October. Prior to the October international break the United head coach looked to be in desperate trouble but United's upturn in form means the conversation around his future has disappeared.",

      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons in the summer. The 22-year-old started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford.",
      "Sesko built on that by scoring against Sunderland to secure a 2-0 victory last month. However, he was benched against Liverpool at Anfield and failed to fire in the next two matches.",
      "The Slovenia international scuffed two chances against Nottingham Forest last weekend. United legend Gary Neville reacted by saying: “He's miles off it compared to the other forwards United brought in.\"",
      "Amroim was asked whether he is relaxed about Sesko's start in Manchester. \"Yeah, I'm relaxed. He's not relaxed,\" he said. \"What I mean is that I understand how things are in football and he's going to struggle.",
      "\"That is normal. He has no experience here. And then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing, and you hear about that with Sesko, and then you come to one club that is the hardest club.",
      "\"If you don't perform every week, you are going to hear a lot of things from club legends, from pundits, from the media, and sometimes they are right.",
      "\"To have the ability to understand that is normal and still maintain your level of confidence is really hard for a young kid, especially for a young kid that is a control freak, wants to control everything, and he's not going to control everything.",

      "\"So everything, I think I'm quite relaxed with that. He is going to be our striker for the long term. But he's going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride, and that is a normal thing in football.\"",
      "Discussing the impact of former United players criticising in the media, Amorim responded: \"Of course, nobody likes to hear, but he struggled a little bit, and that is a fact.",
      "\"So let's embrace that. It’s not personal, it’s not nothing. That is what I try to explain to the players. That is not personal. It's an opinion that is going to change in three weeks.",
      "\"Everything that is true today, in three weeks, could be a lie. So of course, it's hard to hear, but my advice to Ben is you are going to get used. And then it's going to be natural.",

      "\"It’s completely different. I said already, I'm really lucky to be here. And I know that is also important that someone to understand how lucky I am to have this opportunity,\" said Amorim about staying at United.",
      "\"If you see the game, I think we deserve to win. In the end, it doesn't matter. It's hard to see a coach that wins a European cup to go away and the other guy stays. But sometimes it's the difference of maybe in the future to win more important titles. So that's, I think, what Manchester United is thinking.",
      "\"Let's give time to the coach and see what's happening. And then we'll see. So I just want to say about that question, that I'm really lucky to have the support that I have in this club.\"",
      "United will head into the November international break with 20 points if they win against Tottenham.",
      "\"Oh, what I think is that we can win any game. If we have this opportunities, let's make everything to win,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Let's try to address every detail to try to win every game. I don't want to talk about the new goal. You said yourself that everything is so close [in the table], everything so close up, and everything's so close down.",

      "United have long admired the 21-year-old and were heavily linked with a move for him in the summer. His progress at Crystal Palace has seen him emerge as one of the most promising talents in his position, earning a place in the England squad and attracting interest from several top European clubs.",
      "Previous reports suggest Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Wharton, but the midfielder remains fully focused on his role at Palace. He has four years remaining on his current deal at Selhurst Park, following an £18 million move to south London from Blackburn Rovers in 2024.",
      "In an interview with The Athletic, Wharton spoke openly about the speculation. \"I don't really look into it or think too much about it,\" he said. \"There are always rumours floating about on social media. Is it true? Is it not? You tell me.",
      "\"My friends, my family, my brothers, everyone will message me and be like, 'Is it true this club's interested?' I’m like, 'Thanks for telling me because I didn't know.'\"",
      "When pressed about United's interest, Wharton added: \"I don't know who's spreading it or who at United is looking at it. I see it and I'm like, 'OK', and then I carry on with my day.",
      "\"United, the big teams, they're all linked to 10, 20 different players. If I'm one of 20, then it's nothing special, so it doesn't really mean too much. I speak with my agent about planning ahead and possibilities.",
      "\"But at the end of the day, it is who's interested and who's willing to try and get you and if that becomes the case? You can speak about it, but you've got to represent that on the pitch and prove that you deserve it.\"",

      "Meanwhile, United have won just once on the road this season - the 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. But after a difficult start to their Premier League campaign, they've built some momentum and are now four games unbeaten.",
      "Keown believes the Reds have the edge, citing two players as the team's driving force.",

      ".",
      "\"We have to say it's an improvement. I think finally the players have taken on board what the manager's asked them to do. I think it's from [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, the amount of work they're doing is absolutely ridiculous.",
      "\"They retreat to the edge of their own box, they're able to get three players on the sides and what's happening is, if you're looking at Luke Shaw, he'll come out now, from the back three so go and press and then Amad on the right will form a back four.",
      "\"There's a lot of information for those players. It's taken them a hell of a lot time but now look at the number of chances that they're creating. I mean, they have eight shots on target against Arsenal at the start of the season.",
      "He added: \"I think in the sum total since then, it's maybe eight from all the opponents Arsenal played since, so it gives you an idea this is a Manchester United side that seem to be improving but there's some way to go.\"",
      "Keown also pointed out areas where United could exploit Spurs.",
      "\"I've just sat down the last hour and watched the game last week against Chelsea and honestly, stop, start, no intensity, not pressing from the front,\" he explained. \"Thomas Frank, I've been impressed with him, there was an incident after the game where the players refused to shake his hand.",
      "\"I'm not even sure Thomas Frank should have been on the pitch at that point, because this might have worked at Brentford but when you're playing Chelsea, they're an nemesis team for Spurs, you think about when they denied them winning the league all those years ago.",

      "The Frenchman was asked about Madrid's interest and said: \"Yeah, I know the media, sometimes there's some information that's not completely true sometimes. This is some choice you need to make in your career.",
      "\"I've had a couple of clubs [showing an interest], not just Madrid or United, I had a lot of clubs. Today my choice is Manchester, so I'm really happy with this.",
      "\"I know some people talked about this last year because of the results. I can understand them, but honestly, it's my choice, my career. I know what I'm doing, and I'm just going to be better in the future.\"",
      "Yoro's first season in Manchester did not go as planned. He fractured his metatarsal before the campaign, United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost against Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "\"Honestly, I think the experience, especially when you're centre-half, it's really important,\" Yoro said about whether the Premier League had been an eye-opener.",
      "\"I'm just 19, but when you're on the pitch, you don't care about this. If I have a duel with a 30-year-old guy, I'm not going to think about my age, but in terms of some situations, some duels, I think sometimes you need this experience.",
      "\"When you see guys like Harry [Maguire], De Ligt, Shaw, the experienced guys like this, they have some way to face the situation. When you're a centre-half, it depends when you start your career.",
      "\"But especially around 25, 24, or even 27, this is like your peak level because of the experience you have on the pitch. A different way to face the situation is important sometimes.\"",
      "Yoro continued: \"I think everyone knows last season was a really emotional season, I'm going to say. Not even for the coach, for everyone. It was tough, honestly, it was tough for us.",
      "\"To sometimes face the games, face training. So everyone was emotional, to be honest. I think this year is different. Like you say, we didn't have the Champions League, but if you can take the good way of this, we have more time to train, we have more freedom in our head.",
      "\"So, the coach is not different from last year, it's just the result that is different. And every footballer knows that when you win on the day, you have a really perfect week after. It's more about the result in the head. It's not as emotional as last year, I'm going to say.\"",
      "Yoro did not regret his decision to sign for United during a challenging first 12 months. \"I said a couple of times, even with last season, I never had this feeling of regret or something like this,\" he said.",
      "\"I know Manchester United, I know sometimes you can have a bad season, but this club is a top club, so you cannot have doubts about this. I know the project of the club also before I came.",
      "\"Of course, I cannot expect the first year to finish in 15th position. These are some things you need to face also. But you have the director of the club, the coach, all the players, they're here to push you every day. You have confidence in this club. You need to put your heads up every day and try to do your best.\"",
      "United enjoyed an excellent October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which silenced the conversation about Ruben Amorim's system and his future.",
      "\"I have no problem with the system,\" said Yoro. \"I say a couple of times I like to play with three defenders, have more freedom. It's not about the system. You can see we won games against back four and things like this.",
      "\"Last year, people were saying this because of the results, but you can see this year it's better than last year, but we have the same system. We just need to work on small things. But for me, I have no preference [between three or four at the back]. I can play both, and if I'm on the pitch, I'm happy.\"",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests.",
      "\"I think it's just the preference of the coach to do this,\" he explained. \"We get used to it now, since last year, so it's not a problem for us. For example, I know if I'm coming off and Nous (Mazraoui) is coming on like in the last game, I know he's going to give something more to the team.",
      "\"This is something we get used to and it's not a problem for us. Yes [Amorim has explained why he makes the changes], but I cannot tell you everything he's saying to us. Of course, we speak with him every time, especially the defenders.",
      "\"I think it's important for us to understand everything and to know why sometimes he's doing some changes. We had some conversations about this, but this is not a problem for us. Like I said, if I'm on the pitch and I'm happy, if someone subs me, we can add something to the team.\"",
      "Yoro has started on the right of the back-three, meaning he combines with Amad and Mbeumo. \"When I play with Amad and Bryan, I know that Amad likes to attack a lot,\" he said.",
      "\"He's defending also, but of course, it's not the same as if I'm with Diogo Dalot or Mazraoui, because they're more defensive guys, but it's good for me also to have two guys in front who can really attack every time.",
      "\"I'm here also to help them to have the freedom to attack and stay on the back to protect, but I think it's good for them to have two people to attack like this.\"",
      "Mbeumo and Amad have gone viral for celebrating with a Homer Simpson dance. \"Bryan saw a video on the internet and he started doing it, Amad joined in and I joined him after. We said if we score on the weekend, maybe we can do it, but I was too far in defence, so they did it without me,\" Yoro said.",
      "\"It's Homer Simpson doing this. It's crazy, but I can't remember. We need to ask Mbeumo for this. It's funny.\"",
      "United's players have focused on practising defending set-pieces in training. \"Even more than last year,\" said Yoro about the growing importance of set-plays.",
      "\"You can see with Arsenal, they do really well on this, even the long throw this year. We work more on this in training, of course. I think every team does it. You have a coach for this, we are really focused on this. You can save the game, you can kill your game, so we're really focused on this.\"",
      "And they are focused on returning to Europe. \"When you're at Manchester United, you need to play in Europe, especially with what happened last year. Everyone knows our idea is to be in the top, to be in the Champions League, of course. I think we can reach it,\" he explained.",
      "Yoro named Sergio Ramos, Rio Ferdinand and Raphael Varane as defenders he admires. Ferdinand spoke to Yoro to advise him when he signed and predicted he would \"grow\" enormously this season.",
      "The Frenchman has been watching footage of Ferdinand to improve aspects of his own game. It looks to be paying off.",

      "Catch up with the latest news, views and transfer rumours involving Manchester United below.",

      "Manchester United youngster Amass signed for Wednesday on a season-long loan deal, however, although the agreement is set up for the entire campaign, it technically expires on January 5.",
      "This means Sheffield Wednesday must request to extend the loan if they wish to keep him for the season. If they do so, United will then choose whether to accept or reject the request.",

      "Tottenham Hotspur head coach Thomas Frank has admitted Mohammed Kudus will be \"touch and go\" for the visit of Manchester United this weekend.",

      "The Brazilian prodigy has been left out in the cold at the Spanish heavyweights, with manager Xabi Alonso not giving him a single minute of play this season. This situation has piqued the interest of several clubs, including United, West Ham and Juventus - with Villa now also expressing their desire to bring Endrick on loan during the January transfer window.",
      "Endrick has communicated to his agents that he will need to depart from the Bernabeu unless there's a significant shift in his circumstances. He fears that his lack of game-time will jeopardise his spot in Brazil's squad for the World Cup next summer.",

      "No. In fact, I’m already hearing some rumours about Etta Eyong. We receive offers for him every day. The player isn’t going to be sold. He won’t leave this winter. Mainly because our priority is to stay up. It doesn’t make sense to make an effort in the summer and then sell him in the winter. The club’s greatest asset is staying in the first division, even if a very large sum of money comes in.",
      "“We’ll analyse the situation when the season ends. If we stay in the first division, there will be a re-evaluation of the squad. The club will continue to work with the current squad until May 17th, and if a good opportunity arises in the winter transfer window, we will consider it.",

      "A year ago on Saturday, Ruben Amorim was announced as the new Manchester United manager, succeeding Erik ten Hag, who left under a cloud.",
      "The United head coach wanted to take on his new role at the end of the 2024/25 season, but Ineos were insistent. It was either November or never – Amorim chose to jump on board.",
      "His first press conference at Carrington was not held until later that month. Beaming in front of the packed press conference room, Amorim set out a positive message as he looked to bring the current squad on the journey with him.",
      "\"I am a little bit of a dreamer and I believe in myself,\" he said back then. \"I also believe in the club, as I think we have the same idea, the same mindset, so that can help. But I truly believe in the players also, I know that you guys don't believe a lot in these players, but I believe a lot and I think we have room to improve.\"",
      "Fast forward to November 2025, Amorim may not have got the perfect result, but he did get the perfect gift from one of his players in the post-match interviews. Speaking in the mixed zone to MEN Sport, Amad said something which will be music to the manager's ears.",
      "\"I think winning games always gives players confidence and now I think everyone is in a good moment as a team, we are learning every day with the manager because we believe in his system,\" Amad explained. \"But today we are really disappointed because, as a team, we didn’t win.",
      "\"Yeah, of course [we are making progress under Amorim]. At first it wasn’t easy for him and for us, but now we are trying to understand his system and we are trying to do the best every game and we want to win every game because we want to deliver with this club where they deserve to be and we are trying to do that also.\"",
      "Amad's vote of confidence for Amorim's system and way of playing will perhaps mean as much to the United boss as the backing Sir Jim Ratcliffe gave him in October. The Ivorian also believes that United are showing signs of improvement that were not there last season.",
      "\"I think now that the play is getting better and better every game,\" he added. \"When you win, you always have confidence.",
      "\"As a player, I am starting to learn this system with the manager because we are playing in a new system so we have to learn. I think we can get better every game, every day and we are training very hard and I hope we can bring this club to the next level.\"",
      "The only way that Amad and his teammates will be able to do that is by continuing to secure good results both at home and on the road. Next up is a trip to Tottenham Hotspur and the 23-year-old is under no illusions about the scale of that task.",
      "\"We will prepare the game in the week and we know Tottenham is a big team, a good team, we have to be focused until the end and try to have three points there,\" he concluded.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Morgan Gibbs-White levelled the scores in the 48th minute and Nicolo Savona made it 2-1 just two minutes later.",
      "Forest fans sensed their first win in the league since August, but Amad popped up with nine minutes remaining to score a stunning goal which ensured the points were shared.",

      "He paused before adding: \"By more goals [they would have lost]. That is my feeling.\"",

      "\"We talk more about this, that football is like this, and we proved it this year. We can have bad moments, but suddenly we have three good games. So football is like that. And the game is like that also.",
      "\"We had good moments, we score, you can sense we are in control of the game when the first half finished. We started the second half, we suffer, disconnect for five minutes and that's enough in the Premier League, but we managed to recover from that, which is a good feeling.\"",
      "Discussing his thoughts on the game in further detail, Amorim said: \"We lost control of the game for five minutes and paid the price. We did some things well. Our level of energy dropped a little bit.",
      "\"And when our energy drops a little bit, you can feel it. We can play well, but it's not full power. But my feeling is that the players tried, really tried. They tried during the week and tried again today.",
      "\"In the past, if we had this kind of bad five minutes and we suffer two goals, we didn't recover. Today is a different feeling and you can sense we could win this game, but we weren't going to lose, and that's sometimes the feeling a big team sometimes has.",
      "\"We had the opportunity to win in the end, but we drew. We dropped two points. I think last year we suffered a lot. We want to win games and overcome these moments, but now they know how to do it.",
      "\"We just need to be inside of the game until the final 10 minutes of the game. That is part of football. In the past, we could have lost everything in the positions and the way we play the game.",
      "\"I think we are improving in that aspect. Again, we did some things right, but we also have potential to play so much better, which is the goal.\"",

      "Manchester United rescued a point at Nottingham Forest on Saturday thanks to Amad's late volley at the City Ground.",
      "Controversy marred the first half when the Reds benefitted from a corner that looked like it should not have been given as the ball had not crossed the line. However, it was given and Bruno Fernandes' delivery picked out Casemiro who headed home.",
      "Any disappointment for the home fans after the break was short-lived as by the 50th minute they were ahead. First, Morgan Gibbs-White powered a header beyond Senne Lammens before Nicolo Savona scrambled the ball in.",
      "In the end it was Amad who stole the headlines. His volley sent the away end wild and secured a deserved point for the Reds.",
      "Here are some of the moments you may have missed from the game:",
      "United practicing corners",
      "United practiced corners in their warm-up once again. Deliveries came from both sides before they moved into a small-sided game.",
      "United chose to focus on defending corners rather than attacking them in their warm-up, and while neither Forest goal came from a corner, both came from crosses into the box and so United's pre-match drills clearly did very little to improve their ability to defend crosses into the box.",
      "More work is needed.",
      "Maguire hint given",
      "Harry Maguire was named among the substitutes after missing the victory over Brighton. It was a welcome boost for the centre-back following his winner at Liverpool last month.",
      "However, a hint to his fitness was clear when the teams emerged for their warm-ups. Noussair Mazraoui and Maguire came out between 10-15 minutes after their teammates and while the Moroccan immediately joined in with the substitutes, Maguire did some running drills alone.",
      "Unsurprisingly he was an unused substitute at the City Ground.",
      "Neville targeted by chants",
      "On a couple of occasions United fans were reminded that Gary Neville is an unpopular figure at Forest. His comments about the owner Evangelos Marinakis last season saw him banned from co-commentary of Forest's Premier League finale against Chelsea.",
      "A new season has not come with a change of heart from the home faithful and it appears from the chants aimed at Neville that the United legend is still not welcome on the River Trent.",
      "Cunha practices the dark arts",
      "You would have expected Forest players to be surrounding referee Darren England as he walked off the pitch at half-time. But it was Matheus Cunha who led the complaints.",
      "He felt he had been pushed in the face just before the break by Ryan Yates. Cunha has previously worked with Diego Simeone and perhaps some of the Atletico Madrid boss' tricks have been taken on board to the Brazilian.",
      "United frustrations avoided",
      "The United analysts were sat in the press box during the game and for the most part you would not have noticed they were there. However, when United were losing and Benjamin Sesko passed the ball out of play, a recognisable thump of a hand hitting a desk could be heard.",
      "It was unfair on Sesko who enjoyed a good game and Amad's equaliser has perhaps saved the striker's sloppiness from being highlighted.",

      "Made a few important saves and was helpless for the two Forest goals, particularly the second. 6.",

      "The bulk of Forest's attacking play came down the opposite side to Yoro. That is perhaps a compliment to the Frenchman. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Made a superb recovery to thwart Nicolò Savona in the first half. Should have done better for Forest's second. 6",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Will play himself back into the England squad if he continues like this. Unfortunate to be part of a defensive unit that conceded twice. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Had two really good chances when cutting in from the right wing. Had no chance to win the header against Gibbs-White and scored a stunning goal to make it 2-2. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Opened the scoring with a brilliant header. Looked tired as the game progressed, but completed 90 minutes in the Premier League for the first time this season. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Was relatively quiet in the first half until he played a lovely delivery into the box for Casemiro's goal. Hit the post in the second half and Casemiro could not convert the rebound. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "There are always question marks around Dalot when he plays on the left side and he was exposed at various stages of the contest. Amorim demanded more from him and he didn't rise to the occasion. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Playing with huge confidence and could have recorded a few assists if chances had been taken. Played a teasing ball to Benjamin Sesko in the first half but the striker did not gamble on it. 7",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Scuffed a chance in the box at the beginning of the game and dragged another shot wide after skilfully creating a yard of space for himself. Looked sharp and provided a focal point but failed to score. 5",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Although he worked hard he wasn't at his creative best. 6",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "An improvement on Dalot. 6",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Provided quality at the back. 6",

      "Former Premier League referee Keith Hackett has insisted that Manchester United were fortunate not to concede a late penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men extended their unbeaten run after coming from behind to leave the City Ground with a point. After Casemiro put them ahead in the first-half, Forest went ahead through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona before Amad's strike in the 81st minute levelled the scoring.",
      "With the score still 2-1 and United pushing for a equaliser, Forest fans were left fuming when referee Darren England decided against awarding them a penalty. Ryan Yates' flick-on from a corner accidently hit Amad's arm after he mistimed his jump to head away.",
      "Despite protests from supporters and players, England opted not to point to the spot and United eventually equalised. The Premier League Match Centre account on X did not explain why the video assistant referee (VAR) decided not to intervene.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "However, Hackett has insisted the decision was wrong, labelling the incident a \"clear handball offence\" in a post on X. It was the second controversial call that went against Forest after Sean Dyche was left furious with the way United's first goal occurred.",
      "The Forest boss was left angry that a corner was given in the build-up to Casemiro's opener. Savona looked to have kept the ball in play but the assistant on the far side flagged for a corner.",
      "“I just can’t understand it, you’re an assistant referee and 70-odd yards away, you’ve got a goal and a net in the way, but apparently you can see,” Dyche said.",
      "“I’ve got a better view and I’m not in the right position. That’s got to be wrong in the current climate. I’m a big fan of VAR. Someone has got to be able to overrule these decisions, just really quickly, [it would take] only five seconds.",
      "“For me, that’s five seconds of VAR: ‘Bang, that’s it, done, wrong decision.’ It is really, really frustrating two weeks on the trot. With all the technology and all that’s at stake, particularly for us at Nottingham Forest after the start the club has had, that’s a big moment.",
      "“We all want it right, every fan wants it right. The worst thing, I’m back in the game for three games and for two weeks on the trot I’m talking about refereeing decisions. I want to be talking about my team.”",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir would have struggled to believe his luck at the start of the Premier League campaign.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, Bayindir struggled for any minutes at all, with Andre Onana the clear first choice.",
      "After an injury picked up by Onana during the summer, Ruben Amorim chose to trust Bayindir with the gloves. The Cameroonian's poor performance at Grimsby Town, followed by his subsequent exit to Trabzonspor, appeared to have cemented Bayindir's place in the starting XI.",
      "And yet, after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Amorim chose to give Senne Lammens his opportunity and he has not looked back. The Belgian has been impressive and the comparisons from the Stretford End to Peter Schmeichel are of course tongue in cheek but a sign of how good he has been.",
      "Bayindir is now back down the pecking order as second choice at Old Trafford and, with the World Cup coming up at the end of the season, it would be no surprise if he seeks an exit. Amorim may be reluctant to allow him to leave without a replacement lined up, but would he really stop him leaving if a decent bid was tabled?",
      "If Bayindir goes in January, it would see Tom Heaton pushed into an unexpected new role as second choice goalkeeper, should a replacement not arrive in the mid-season window.",
      "If that happens, it would be a fitting half season for Heaton, especially when he is expected to retire at the end of the campaign. The 39-year-old has had a brilliant career, and to finish up back at United as a regular in the matchday squad would be a solid achievement.",
      "If Bayindir does choose to leave, Heaton may be handed a promotion.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "“There’s a lot of information for those players. It’s taken them a hell of a lot time but now look at the number of chances that they’re creating. I mean, they have eight shots on target against Arsenal at the start of the season.",

      "Ruben Amorim could easily have defended Benjamin Sesko to the hilt after Gary Neville took the Manchester United striker to task this week. Instead he agreed with the pundit while backing the summer signing to come good, displaying the sort of man-management the Red Devils fans will be praying prevents the £66m man from walking the same bleak path to obscurity as his predecessor at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko has two goals and an assist in 11 appearances for United and Neville said after their 2-2 draw with Nottingham Forest last weekend that “he’s well off it” compared to fellow big-money forwards signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Neville said: “I’m no further forward with him. The jury is out.",
      "“He’s well off it compared to the other summer signings that Man United made up front in [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "“He looks awkward, he had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half when balls got played over the top and his touch wasn’t quite right.",
      "“For 80 million pound, you can say he’s young, has a lot of potential and is only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.”",
      "The typical response to such criticism being aimed at a young footballer signed for a a big transfer fee from abroad, as Arne Slot has said in defence of Florian Wirtz in particular this season, is the need for time to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League.",
      "But rather than handing Sesko that get-out clause, Amorim backed Neville’s assertion, claiming the United legend’s comments weren’t opinion but “fact”.",
      "“I’m relaxed. He’s not relaxed,” Amorim said when asked about the striker’s form. “I understand how things are in football and he’s going to struggle – that is normal.",
      "“He has no experience here, and then the first impact when everyone says that you are so good, you are the next big thing – and you hear about that with Sesko – and then you come to one club that is the hardest club.",
      "“If you don’t perform every week, you are going to hear a lot of things from club legends, from pundits, from the media, and sometimes they are right.",
      "“To have the ability to understand that is normal and still maintain your level of confidence is really hard for a young kid, especially for a young kid that is a control freak.",
      "“He wants to control everything, and he’s not going to control everything. Of course, nobody likes to hear it, but he struggled a little bit and that is a fact.",
      "“So let’s embrace that. It’s not personal, it’s not nothing. That is what I try to explain to the players.",
      "“That is not personal. It’s an opinion that is going to change in three weeks. Everything that is true today, in three weeks could be a lie.”",

      "Other than a brief reference to having “no experience” there are no caveats here. Amorim has essentially, gently told Sesko that he’s not been good enough, to take criticism that every Manchester United footballer will experience at some stage of their Old Trafford career on the chin and recognise that opinions – or indeed “facts” – can change in an instant in modern football.",
      "Sesko need only consider how United as a whole have gone from crisis club to Champions League qualification hopefuls in the space of a month, and may very well be in crisis once again should they lose to Tottenham on Saturday, to understand how volatile the narrative can be and take a more relaxed stance with regard to his form.",
      "Amorim added: “So of course, it’s hard to hear. But my advice to Ben is you are going to get used to it, and then it’s going to be natural. It’s going to be like your Monday here.",
      "“So that is part of the process and we are going to help him, and we are going to protect Ben because he works really hard and we want to succeed. So he’s going to succeed.",
      "“When I start training with Ben, he has more potential than I was thinking. He’s going to struggle and we need to understand how he likes to play also to put in our ideas.",
      "“He is going to be our striker for the long term. But he’s going to have these struggles and these bumps during the ride, and that is a normal thing in football.”",
      "Sesko, Amorim and United will be desperate to avoid him going the same way as Rasmus Hojlund, who was similarly heralded before he arrived a the club, and indeed for most of his first season at Old Trafford, as “the next big thing”.",
      "But Amorim never gave Hojlund the same “striker for the long term” vote of confidence he’s bestowed upon Sesko, whom the United boss is managing expertly, at least publicly, by insisting he will be The Man for Manchester United but agreeing with Neville over a long road yet to travel, taking the sting out of the pundit’s criticism in the process.",

      "Admittedly, it was easier to catch opponents offside in the pre-Premier League era before interfering with play became A Thing. Back then, an attacker could time a run to perfection as their opponents were sprinting out en masse and still be flagged because his lazy pr*ck of a team-mate was stood with his thumb up his arse 40 yards away from any position of consequence.",
      "And we are not lobbying for a return of the old laws after the more recent tweaks to what’s offside and what’s not have made it increasingly difficult to trigger a linesman’s flag, especially in open play. But not impossible.",
      "When defending free kicks, which are increasingly going longer, there remains an opportunity to avoid any hassle of actual defending simply by charging out on cue.",
      "You couldn’t do it every time, but that’s what keeps it interesting. And it’s an opportunity for set-piece coaches to justify their existence with multiple attacking running lines.",

      "But it’s actually a little better than it was. Last season saw a slight rise in the average number of crosses per team per game in open play on the previous two seasons. Which is encouraging, but we must not rest until we have killed and burned the notion that crossing is a bad thing.",
      "What kind of joyless grump, 20 years ago, watched Beckham, Figo, Roberto Carlos – or even Stuart Ripley, Steve Guppy, Stewart Downing – get a yard and deliver, only to conclude football needed less of it, not more?",
      "Surely better that than endless ‘recycling’, passing square and back under the guise of probing to play through? One approach does not have to be exclusive to the other. Defenders are comfortable when play is predictable so, even if you prefer a penetrative pass, keep backlines – and your underused centre-forward – on their toes with the old shift-it-and-swing-it.",
      "Even if it is true that crossing is a low-percentage play, then we must do more of it to make it pay. Mikel Arteta knows. It takes 10 crosses to produce one attempt on goal, does it? How many from 100 crosses then? *taps temple*",

      "The game is awash with inverted wingers, all desperate to dribble across a line rather than down one. Which is fine when it works. But for the kind of success rate to make it a worthwhile, you need to be the actual Arjen Robben.",
      "Instead, we’re left with wingers so woefully predictable, it’s barely a test for any middling full-back. Tackling? Not necessary; just keep guiding them on the route up their own arse.",
      "The urge to drive towards goal is perhaps natural, but too few modern wingers recognise that a willingness and capability to go outside will inevitably create more opportunities to get by on the inside.",
      "Decide for yourself if being a winger is the easiest position to play but it’s almost certainly the simplest. In possession, get down the outside and cross; or penetrate on the inside. By suggesting you should be able to go either way, we’re really not asking for much here, lads.",

      "“Of course, I can easily criticise strikers, teams, players, coaches, etc. But we need to look for that criticism that is constructive, that is going to give you something extra, that you’re going to think about and say, ‘Well, wait a minute, he or she has a point’.",
      "“Of course, there are some ex-football players who earn the right, more than others, to criticise, and that’s why I think Gary Neville is in the frame to say and express more criticism based on his career at United, what he’s achieved, won, and how much time he spent there.",
      "“In my case, I think I try to give my opinion, but a constructive one, and try maybe to see more of the positive side of things, expressing what I expect from the players. Sesko has a slow start, but let’s hope he’s ready to jump and to bring the necessary goals that he’s required from the number nine at United.”",
      "Berbatov has also explained why he thinks Sesko “has everything”.",
      "“He has everything that a striker should have,” Berbatov claimed.",
      "“He’s tall, he’s athletic. Left, right foot, he scored some bangers in the Bundesliga, heading as well. But the Bundesliga is different from the Premier League. The Premier League is a completely different beast.",
      "“He is dependent, of course, on the service he gets from his players. And that’s why I say get to know your teammates, how your teammates are playing.”",
      "He added: “This is United, this is one of the biggest teams in the world. The pressure is always there, even when you sleep. The pressure is going to be there. So be patient. Sometimes the slow start means that you’re just ready to jump.”",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead.",

      "Amorim has started to turn things around at Old Trafford after an inauspicious start to the season saw talk of his sacking ramp up following their worst Premier League finish last term.",
      "Key to the turnaround has been the form of revitalised midfielder Casemiro, and to a lesser extent Maguire in defence.",
      "The pair have represented fuzzy transfer thinking from the Red Devils hierarchy for much of their Old Trafford careers, with Maguire costing them £80m and Casemiro joining for £70m, and neither reaching the heights those fees command in the main.",
      "But they’ve impressed with their quality and leadership this term, and with both able to leave for nothing at the end of the season, Amorim is eager for the club to take up the option they hold for both to extend their deals by a further year at the end of the campaign.",
      "He said in his pre-match press conference: “Yeah, we don’t know what is going to happen. My goal is to continue to count with Casemiro, with Harry Maguire.",
      "“He has the same problem [Maguire]. I don’t know what is going to happen. Let’s focus on this season.",

      "Whitwell said on the Talk of the Devils podcast: “I don’t think there’s any talks ongoing. I could be wrong, but in a similar vein to Harry Maguire’s situation, I think it’s on the club to see how the season goes, and they’ve, in a way, got a bit of advantage there. I know that both players will doubtless have suitors, particularly on free transfers, but I think you’d expect, if they wanted to stay, United have got that leverage there.",
      "“But yeah, with Casemiro, I had just assumed up to this point that he would leave at the end of this season, because the plus one, obviously, United have got in their favour, would then trigger another £280,000 a week before, then it goes up if they qualify for the Champions League by 25%. And so they just wouldn’t do that. Now as the season’s ongoing and he’s playing more, I don’t know, maybe they have a conversation around it, maybe he’s open to stay if he is open to having a lower salary.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results. There are only five teams left unbeaten in the Champions League, and three of those are Arsenal, Man City and Spurs.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 12th, while Villa and Palace also look near certainties to progress from the Europa and Conference respectively. For all their nonsense, Forest ought to be fine in the end too.",
      "Total points: 89.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",

      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently around the cut line at 24th and 26th.",

      "“What we need to focus on is the future. We know that as a club we made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that.",
      "“Let’s not focus on what happened, let’s focus on what we are doing now. We are doing that, changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, the way we want the players to behave.",
      "“We are doing that and we are improving so let’s focus on the way we are doing things. We are improving, let’s continue and forget the past.”",
      "When asked about the state of Man Utd, Ronaldo added in his interview: “I’m sad because [Manchester United] are one of the most important clubs in the world, that I still have in my heart for obvious reasons.",
      "“You have to [have] intelligent people, smart people, to create a base [that you can build on] for the future, as Manchester United had many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, David Beckham.",
      "“Manchester United right now don’t have a structure. I hope that changes in the future, because the potential of the club is amazing. They are one of the most important clubs of the century.”",
      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants to retain the services of a key Man Utd pair he’s ‘really happy’ with beyond the end of the season.",
      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has made an appearance on a new podcast series for the Red Devils’ official website called ‘Inside Carrington’.",

      "A Manchester United star with 10 clubs reportedly tracking him will push for an exit in January, with a source saying “make no mistake about it.”",
      "United have made a big leap this season from last. While they are eighth in the Premier League, they are only two points off second-placed Manchester City, with a large clump of sides all on similar points.",
      "Last season, the Red Devils finished 15th, so being so competitive at this stage is a good sign for Ruben Amorim, who has been under threat, at least in the media.",
      "One of his biggest calls this season has been giving Kobbie Mainoo hardly any minutes. The Englishman is seen as a prodigious talent, but with only two midfield spots, Amorim has given him just 138 minutes of action in the Premier League.",
      "Mainoo was a target for a few sides in the summer, but was kept at United as a backup option.",
      "Having hardly played this term, Caught Offside reports sources have stated he will be looking for the exit when the winter window opens.",
      "One was said to state: “They stopped him leaving in the summer, but make no mistake, he wants out, and the club know that.”",
      "Further to that, the report named the 10 sides who want to land the United midfielder in January.",
      "Alongside Napoli, who are named as the leaders in the race – with ‘strong and concrete interest’ – there is also interest from: Chelsea, Tottenham, Newcastle, Manchester City, Leeds, Everton, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.",
      "The line from United remains that they do not want to let Mainoo go. However, interest from Atletico could make for the most intriguing given what it could represent to the Red Devils.",
      "Conor Gallagher is said to possibly be able to leave Atletico, creating space for Mainoo to possibly join.",
      "United would not make it easy for Mainoo to head to the Spanish side, but it could be mutually beneficial if they are the side who lands Gallagher.",
      "They have been linked with him for some time and as the January window nears, those links are becoming stronger.",
      "In late October, it was reported that United are ‘determined’ to lodge a decent bid for Gallagher. If they can come to an agreement with Atletico between the two midfielders, then there seems a chance that both moves could happen.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has informed INEOS what he thinks ‘must’ be done in this January transfer window.",
      "Man Utd are “very unlikely” to allow wantaway duo Joshua Zirkzee or Kobbie Mainoo to leave Old Trafford in January, according to the club’s ex-chief scout.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided that one of their players has ‘no future’ at the club, while another is in ‘advanced’ exit talks.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo could leave his boyhood club in January as INEOS have decided to ‘open the door’ to an exit.",
      "Napoli are now prepared to pay all the wages of Kobbie Mainoo as they look to take the Man Utd midfielder on loan in January, according to reports.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo’s England place is at risk under Ruben Amorim. A January move to Napoli could be his only way to make the World Cup…"

      "Man Utd director of football Jason Wilcox has made an appearance on a new podcast series for the Red Devils’ official website called ‘Inside Carrington’.",
      "Wilcox has gone from complete silence to two interviews in a week after the tide has turned in a positive direction for Man Utd over the past month.",
      "Ruben Amorim won his first back-to-back games since arriving at Old Trafford a year ago and those two wins turned into three when they beat Brighton 4-2 late last month.",
      "A 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest at the weekend would have been a great result last season and it was important this campaign in order to keep Amorim’s unbeaten run going.",
      "Confidence is slowly building at Old Trafford with Man Utd supporters no longer looking ahead to matches with trepidation.",
      "A few good results on the bounce has already seen Wilcox pat himself on the back and now he has had a deep dive into various subjects to do with the club.",
      "Here are five of his most fascinating insights from the ‘Inside Carrington’ interview…",
      "",
      "Wilcox said: “It is not about putting the Harlem Globetrotters together. If I look at successful Man United teams, there were very functional players that would die for the badge and there were some mavericks.”",
      "On what the Red Devils are looking for, the Man Utd director of football added: “Last year’s summer window [2024] was a lot more chaotic than this one and this one was really calm. With this one, we knew the plan, we knew which players we were going to target, we had our lists, we knew which areas of the pitch we needed to improve.",
      "“These are continuous meetings with myself and Ruben [Amorim], with Chris Vivell and with his team underneath, where we are very clear on the profiles that we need. So, the brief will come from myself and Ruben, it goes into Chris, there is a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles that we need, and then the scouts will go into the market, we will combine that with the data team and then there will just be constant dialogue.",
      "“Right now, I am having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles, the age bracket, the cost, are they attainable, with Ruben as well, so it is a really joined-up approach. When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process. The data team are involved in the process and we will then focus all our attention on certain players.”",
      "“It is really important then that we do the background checks on whether they are clean-living professionals. This is really important. This year, we looked at Premier League-ready players and certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn’t take too much risk in this area. We needed players that we could plug in and play, with little transition time.”",
      "",
      "“Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers that have got huge potential. Senne was available and we decided to move, but it wasn’t a kneejerk reaction. Tony Coton was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it. This guy is going to be a top signing for us and he has started well, but he has got to keep it going. He is very reflective and he is very professional with his approach.”",
      "",
      "“Benji, at the top end, he’s going to be an amazing player. It’s difficult to be the no.9 at United and I know sometimes that Matheus and Bryan are getting a lot of credit, but the runs that Benji is making is also helping Matheus and Bryan as well.",
      "“All four of them have done really well, the summer signings from last year, they are top professionals.”",
      "",
      "“We’ve just got to continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for. We have got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, it is really important and we have to put the jigsaw pieces together.",
      "“Putting the jigsaw pieces together, we would love to have all of the pieces in place where we can see a very, very clear picture but, whilst we are building and whilst we are building the picture, it is even more difficult when you lose some football matches because people start questioning things. But we are really clear, myself and Ruben, Omar [Berrada], the ownership, we are really clear on the direction of travel and this is really important.”",
      "",
      "“All we are doing now is making sure that we make decisions for the football club and not for the benefit, not for the short-term protection of ourselves, we’re making some really bold decisions for the future of Man United.",
      "“Man United is bigger than any player, any manager, any staff member. We are custodians, if you like, and we’ve just got to understand that at some point our journey will end, inevitably.",
      "“We need to make sure that when we leave this football club, whenever that is, and I hope I am here for a long, long time, that this football club is in a much better position.”",
      "Ruben Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham feels hugely significant for Manchester United.",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants to retain the services of a key Man Utd pair he’s ‘really happy’ with beyond the end of the season.",
      "Ruben Amorim admits Man Utd have “made a lot of mistakes” but insists his side are “improving” after criticism from Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has not minced his words on his former club and Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Wolves getting rid of Vitor Pereira leaves two joint-favourites in the Sack Race, though one manager is surely the most likely to go next…"

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are intensifying their pursuit of Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, viewing him as a prime and realistic target for the January transfer window, and TEAMtalk can reveal an offer is being prepped.",
      "Sources close to Man Utd indicate that the Red Devils are confident of securing a deal, despite Forest’s firm stance on demanding a substantial fee.",
      "Anderson, the 22-year-old England star who joined Forest from Newcastle United in a £35million deal last summer, has quickly established himself as a key player at the City Ground.",
      "His energetic displays in midfield have caught the eye of United’s boss, Ruben Amorim, who sources say is desperate to inject more dynamism and legs into his engine room.",
      "With the team getting better but struggling for consistency in the Premier League, Amorim sees Anderson’s relentless work rate, pressing ability, and box-to-box stamina as the perfect fit for his high-intensity system.",
      "Another key attribute wooing higher-ups at Man Utd is Anderson’s ability to break the lines with his pinpoint passing.",
      "Such a trait meshes well with Amorim’s attacking philosophy which prioritises faster-paced attacks over more measured and deliberate build-ups.",
      "United’s belief in landing Anderson stems from multiple factors.",
      "Club insiders reveal that the player himself would be “very keen” on a move to Old Trafford, attracted by the opportunity to compete at the highest level and the chance to immerse himself in the prestige of a ‘big six’ club.",
      "This mutual interest could prove pivotal in negotiations, especially as United scout the market for affordable reinforcements amid financial fair play constraints.",
      "However, Nottingham Forest have drawn a clear line in the sand: pay big money or back off.",
      "Forest are under no pressure to sell and value Anderson highly after his seamless integration.",
      "As such, we understand Forest are setting their stall out around the £80m mark, though United believe a deal can be struck for closer to £60m.",
      "Anderson’s contributions have been perhaps the brightest spark at the City Ground this term in what has otherwise been a season of doom and gloom for the 19th-placed side so far.",
      "Forest are well aware losing Anderson would have a detrimental effect on their ability to stave off relegation, thus ensuring they’ll put up stiff resistance if Man Utd do act on their interest and thunder in with a significant bid.",
      "Amorim’s tactical blueprint demands midfielders who can cover ground relentlessly, and Anderson’s profile aligns perfectly.",
      "Amorim operates with a 3-4-2-1 formation, with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro the most selected midfield pairing in between the wing-backs this season.",
      "Given the wing-backs are tasked with controlling an entire flank by themselves, United’s two-man midfield can often be exposed against teams who deploy three in the middle. This is just one of the reasons why a relentless engine is such a valued trait for Amorim when the Portuguese signs midfielders.",
      "United’s hierarchy shares Amorim’s adoration of the player, along with his optimism a deal CAN be made in the winter window.",
      "Accordingly, sources state the club are prepared to test Forest’s resolve with a structured offer that would total a figure around £60m.",
      "As the January window approaches, this saga could define United’s mid-season revival. Will Forest hold firm, or will Anderson’s ambition propel him to Manchester? The coming weeks will tell.",
      "In other news, TEAMtalk can reveal the primary reason why United have abandoned their attempts to sign Endrick on loan in January.",
      "Elsewhere, Man Utd have been savaged for offloading a player who is now ‘unstoppable’.",
      "Finally, a report has detailed the ‘dilemma’ Ruben Amorim faces with a Man Utd star he can’t live with but can’t live without.",

      "The Red Devils have been very active in the transfer market in recent months, with club chiefs sanctioning a significant squad overhaul after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "In the summer transfer window, Man Utd largely focused on improving their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana as their No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Ruben Amorim‘s side were able to secure these marquee signings as they raised funds through offloading Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho.",

      "Still, Man Utd have improvements to make in certain positions, with it widely reported that their top priority is to sign a new No.6 in January or next summer.",
      "United made an audacious move for Brighton star Carlos Baleba in the summer, though they were priced out of a move for the £100m-rated midfielder.",

      "This may be difficult as Forest will obviously be keen to keep their prized asset, but Man Utd are said to be ‘confident that a deal can be struck’.",

      "‘Forest are under no pressure to sell and value Anderson highly after his seamless integration.",

      "Man Utd are also being linked with Everton standout Branthwaite as they plot a possible double deal, though another report from TEAMtalk claims they have no chance of landing the centre-back in January.",
      "It is noted that their ‘decision’ on Branthwaite is that ‘he’s going nowhere in January’.",

      "‘Everton have consistently valued Branthwaite at £70million (€79.5m, $91.5m) or more; a figure that deters all but the most ambitious bidders.",

      "Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo has not minced his words on his former club and Red Devils head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Ronaldo had two spells at Man Utd as a player, with it fair to say that his first stint at Old Trafford was far more successful than his second.",
      "The five-time Ballon d’Or winner butted heads with Erik ten Hag before leaving the Red Devils, with the Dutchman rightly preferring to select United’s younger stars at the beginning of the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Naturally, Ronaldo did not respond well to this treatment and spat his dummy out en route to having his contract terminated by mutual consent, with the 40-year-old hitting out at Ten Hag, the Glazer family and club legend in a now-infamous interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "Since leaving, Man Utd have continued to flounder as they have struggled under Amorim before their recent upturn, while Ronaldo has spent the last couple of years in the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr.",
      "Now. Ronaldo has had another interview with Morgan and has hit out at Man Utd again.",
      "He has revealed his thoughts on the “sad” situation at Man Utd, claiming Amorim is “doing his best” and cannot “do miracles”.",
      "“I’m sad because [Manchester United] are one of the most important clubs in the world, that I still have in my heart for obvious reasons,” Ronaldo said on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "READ: Arsenal lose, United beat Spurs, City beat Liverpool: Five things to mitigate the worst interlull ever",
      "“You have to [have] intelligent people, smart people, to create a base [that you can build on] for the future, as Manchester United had many years ago. Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, David Beckham.",
      "“Manchester United right now don’t have a structure. I hope that changes in the future, because the potential of the club is amazing. They are one of the most important clubs of the century.”",
      "When asked about his relationship with his former club, Ronaldo responded: “I was there for so many years. I won the Champions League, the Golden Ball, I won like, 12, 13 or 14 trophies there. Manchester United are still in my heart.",
      "“I love that club. But we have to all be honest and say they are not on a good path. They need to change. And it’s not only about the coach and the players, in my opinion.",
      "“[Ruben Amorim is] doing his best. [He’s] not going to do miracles. This is impossible.",
      "“Manchester United have good players but some of them don’t have the mind, what Manchester United is.”",
      "Ronaldo extended his Al Nassr contract until 2027 and this could be his last before retirement. He also admitted to Morgan that he will call time on his career “soon”.",
      "“Soon. But I think I will be prepared,” Ronaldo said on retirement.",
      "“It will be tough, of course. It will be difficult? Yes. Probably (I) will cry, yes… I’m (an) open person. (It) will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "“But Piers, I prepare my future since (the age of) 25, 26, 27 years old, I prepare (for) my future. So I think I will be capable to support that pressure.”",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Friday 7 November 2025 15:46, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and explains why Arsenal's winning streak will be under threat at Sunderland.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium should be a fortress - a new-build modern footballing arena full of intimidation. But right now it feels more like a luxury spa for visiting teams.",
      "Opponents don't turn up dreading it. They turn up enjoying it. It's football's version of checking into a five-star hotel. You get pampered, you play your game and more often than not, you leave with something to show for it.",
      "That's seen in Spurs' home record of late. In the last year, Spurs have the fewest points (13), fewest wins (3) and most defeats (12) at home than any other ever-present side and have kept just three clean sheets in the last 39 Premier League games at home.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are box office again. Not in the relentless, ruthless, title-challenging way of Sir Alex Ferguson's juggernaut but in the sense that you simply can't take your eyes off them.",
      "United aren't ready to challenge for honours yet. They are a team built for moments - not for consistency, meaning they can't be trusted still as a betting proposition in the win market where they are favourites here at 29/20 with Sky Bet. The greater value is found in their total goals line where the 10/11 for them to score over 1.5 goals rates as nice wager - something which has landed in seven of their last nine games.",
      "Jack Grealish and card-based plays are very much a profitable theme of this season. Grealish remains the most fouled player in the Premier League having been fouled 29 times. He's drawing cards from these fouls too with Trai Hume, Daniel Munoz, Matty Cash and Mads Wieffer all being booked for challenges on Grealish.",
      "Opponents are doubling up and generally spending 90 minutes trying to test his patience as much as his skill. When he doesn't get the decisions, the petulance tends to bubble up, which also makes Grealish a underrated player in the to be carded market himself.",
      "Grealish doesn't lose his head often, but when he does, it's usually in games exactly like this against a physical side who are happy to foul, frustrate and use game management techniques. It's 12/1 with Sky Bet for both Grealish's direct opponent Kenny Tete and Grealish to be carded.",
      "Keep an eye on Crysencio Summerville if you're looking to grab some value in the coming weeks.",
      "Because under Nuno Espirito Santo's new counter-attacking West Ham, the Dutchman looks built to be the headline act in the attacking prop markets. Nuno's blueprint took shape in their win over Newcastle: sit deep, soak up and strike. It's the same model that brought him success at Wolves and Nottingham Forest where defensive structure, lightning transitions and wide players given license to explode into space are to the fore.",
      "And that's where Summerville fits perfectly. He's been bubbling nicely under the radar with his performances for West Ham but could be about to take centre stage in this system based on his showing against Newcastle. He had three shots, one on target and a first goal of the season isn't far away. It may come here with 3/1 with Sky Bet standing out.",
      "Remember, football is defined by fine margins and is a very low-scoring sport.",
      "No matter how good of a team you are, a bit of variance and misfortune is going to hit you at some point. Arsenal are a fantastic team, keeping eight clean sheets in a row and winning the last 10 - it's incredible stuff but this isn't an unbeatable outfit. They have flaws.",
      "The outcomes in football are too volatile to allow perfection to persist.",
      "And when it comes to betting on football, the shrewdest of gamblers out there understand this and instead of chasing the streak, they are looking for opportunities for when it snaps.",
      "And at the prices here I want to be with Sunderland to end the Arsenal streak at the prices on offer.",
      "Sunderland are a fiercely organised side who are defensively secure. Robin Roefs has commanded his box very efficiently in goal to the extent that Sunderland have the second-best record in the Premier League when it comes to goals conceded from set-pieces. Arsenal can be very difficult to stop from such scenarios but Sunderland look well placed to deal with the set-piece machine.",
      "This is the time to be brave, sail against the market and get ahead of the 'bad day at the office for Arsenal' curve where all their streaks end.",
      "My main play is to back both teams to score at 6/5 with Sky Bet with eyes also on Sunderland to win at 7/1 and Sunderland to win to nil at 12/1.",
      "A nervous referee is a card-happy referee. We have an inexperienced one in charge here with Andrew Kitchen overseeing just his fourth Premier League game. This is the biggest and highest profile one he's been assigned to.",
      "With these inexperienced referees the pressure of refereeing by the law, not the spirit of the game, often takes over when the Premier League microscope zooms in. A tactical foul that in the Championship might have been managed with a word suddenly becomes a nailed-on booking in the Premier League.",
      "And Chelsea are just crazy for cards since the start of last season. Their games are averaging 4.9 yellows per game in that period - that's the highest of any team. Furthermore, this fixture does have lots of spice attached to it with the last six averaging 6.9 total cards per game, including the most recent Carabao Cup tie which saw nine yellows and a red shown.",
      "I'm very keen on backing the cards line with 11/10 with Sky Bet on offer for over 4.5 cards shown.",
      "Bournemouth will be rested, organised and fully revved under Andoni Iraola - and will surely fancy their chances of turning over an Aston Villa side running on European fumes. The Premier League calendar hasn't been kind to Aston Villa - facing Iraola's team after a midweek game is a brutal examination.",
      "Thursday nights in Europe are still glamorous but they take a toll. For all of Unai Emery's tactical acumen, his squad isn't yet deep enough to juggle the workload without something giving.",
      "Bournemouth have had a full week to prepare, to rest legs and to fine tune a high-tempo, front-foot plan under Iraola. They're one of the league's fittest sides, pressing with purpose and breaking with pace. All this hasn't been factored into the match prices enough so the Cherries look a nice price on the draw no bet at 11/8 with Sky Bet.",
      "Newcastle were \"unrecognisable\" according to their boss Eddie Howe in their 3-1 defeat to West Ham. The lack of intensity and attacking threat felt very un-Newcastle-like.",
      "Just a one-off then? No, it's not.",
      "Having looked a little deeper, these underwhelming displays and results away from St James' Park are an issue under Howe.",
      "At home Newcastle feel empowered - they press, they go at you and they look expansive and confident. On the road it's different. They're more cautious and Howe has struggled to find a formula that allows them to flourish away from the magic of St James' Park.",
      "The defeat at the London Stadium means Newcastle are now eight league games without a win on the road stretching across the summer. Jacob Murphy's strike on Sunday was also just their fourth goal scored across those eight matches and their expected goals data across that winless run is trending at a paltry 1.2 per 90. Horrendous numbers.",
      "Therefore, it's very surprising to see them chalked up as favourites to win at Brentford with the home side available at Evens on the draw no bet.",
      "Writing about Danny Welbeck being in the form of his life in 2025 was not on my radar - but here we are.",
      "The Brighton front man is purring with confidence, looking sharper, hungrier and crucially for punters, more productive than ever. He's clocked up six goal involvements in his last six appearances, and if you zoom in on his recent minutes against Palace, it's even more impressive: three goal involvements in his last 150 minutes.",
      "These aren't streaky stats, they're signs of a player who's thriving in Fabian Hurzeler's fluid attacking structure. So, at 7/4 with Sky Bet for a goal or an assist? That's value.",
      "Sean Dyche is certainly getting to work. His fingerprints are already all over Forest's recent performances. There's been a higher ratio of long passes, more pressures in the final third and already the quality of chances Forest are facing is much lower than when under the gaze of Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Dyche is doing the sensible thing and making Forest much harder to score against.",
      "It's that defensive improvement shown under Dyche and Leeds' flakiness in attack that makes a Forest clean sheet easy to fancy here. They are actually 18 Premier League games without one - the club's worst run since 1960. And Dyche will be losing sleep over something like that.",
      "If you look back at Dyche's last 18 games as a manager, 15 of those landed for punters backing 'no' in the both teams to score market.",

      "For punters eyeing up the first goalscorer market this weekend with Erling Haaland in their sights, it's worth asking whether the Norwegian's price truly stacks up at 3/1 with Sky Bet. Spoiler alert: it doesn't.",
      "The bookies dangle Haaland up at skinny odds and the rest of City's attacking talent gets priced as if they're supporting actors. That might make sense when City are bullying lesser sides but Liverpool are not that. And against Virgil van Dijk, Haaland's aura tends to dim.",

His two goals in midweek pointed towards a return of those numbers which makes his 7/1 with Sky Bet quotes for the first goal look rather generous in a game that looks so difficult to call from an outright perspective.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 21:24, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",

      "Dermot Gallagher reveals all as he examines incidents from across the weekend, including Amad's late equaliser at Nottingham Forest, Onana and Mac Allister's penalty box incident, Donnarumma's complaints after Bournemouth hit back and Bentancur's challenge on James",
      "Monday 3 November 2025 11:37, UK",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher is back with the latest Ref Watch after a busy weekend of incidents, including Manchester United's dubious goal from a corner at Nottingham Forest.",
      "INCIDENT: Man Utd's first goal comes after a dubious corner is awarded. Corner complaints for Forest for the second week running - why won't VAR intervene for corners?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Why has the referee made that judgment? I don't know, because if the ball does go out and he doesn't see it, I can understand that, because he has got two goal posts there.",
      "\"He's got a goalkeeper, he's got [Nicolo] Savona himself in front of him, but he's made a judgment from 75 - 80 yards, incorrectly. You know, he's probably thought it's gone out, but it hasn't.",
      "\"The referee, I feel for as that depth, you're not going to see. If it hit the line like that, you wouldn't give a goal.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"The ball's definitely not gone out, and the fact that the linesman has made a judgment call from about, what, 70 yards. The referee was closer. I know he's a bit of a different angle, but the referee was definitely closer.",
      "\"It's just too far to say. But again, this is twice in two weeks now and I'm thinking to myself, well, there's goal line technology.",
      "\"Maybe that can be used across the whole byline, but then obviously, they can't change the rules this year, but it's definitely something they need to look at for next year, because it will cost teams ultimately.",
      "\"I think you can look at that in 10 seconds, and it will be cleared up and there will be no debate. They have enough time to look at that and make a decision.\"",
      "INCIDENT: The ball strikes Patrick Dorgu on the arm in the build-up to Amad's equaliser at Forest, but the goal stands.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It strikes his arm on the way through, but the rule is, has he scored? No, so he is not penalised for that.",
      "\"Is it deliberate? No, it brushes his arm on the way through, so it is not a deliberate play, so the game goes on, it gets cleared and he shoots.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Amadou Onana grabs Alexis Mac Allister by the throat in the penalty area while attacking a corner - why just a yellow?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The fact they were pushing and shoving each other and all right, he's raised his arm, probably a bit higher than he wanted, but he's pushing.",
      "\"Stuart's got to decide, is it violent? Is it an act of brutality? He said: 'No,' he's obviously relayed to the VAR what he's seen, VAR has checked it back. The referee said, yellow card only.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"As much as I like a physical game, I look at this situation, I'm like, if someone puts their hand on my throat in the street like that, you're gonna get an aggressive reaction from me.",
      "\"So in that instance, I'm saying that should be a red card, because obviously Mac Allister can't do that, right? Mac Allister has made the most of it. He's gone down, right? And that's probably because if he reacts, he'll get a red card too.",
      "\"So I think he's gone down there, and obviously, it's something that the official should have picked up.",
      "\"But I look at that and I say that is aggressive, because again, I reiterate, if that happens off the football pitch and someone does that to you, you're going to react in a certain way, which probably be aggressive, or you're going to call HR!\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gianluigi Donnarumma complained he was held by David Brooks as Bournemouth netted an equaliser from a corner at Man City.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I thought it was a goal. I've seen refs take a much different approach. It's not a good punch. I don't think the forward does much wrong.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If you look at Donnarumma, it looks like it's not affecting him that much.",
      "\"When you look at all the players in the box, they're all nudging each other. There is contact. There is, you know, how many people are in the box? There are 20 players in there, so I don't understand why keepers want more protection.",
      "\"He's six foot seven, and his span upwards would probably be about nine feet. I don't understand why he's complaining there.",
      "\"He's complaining because he's punched that, but it's a bad punch and a goal has come of it. It's definitely not a foul. And I think keepers, again, I feel like they get too much protection, and in that scenario, for the referee, fantastic decision.",
      "\"He should be commanding that area more. The only person I've seen say it was a foul is Guardiola. What are we saying now? It's a non-contact sport.",
      "\"Brooks has definitely not fouled him. The referees have been consistent about this, and I think it's been good.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Rodrigo Bentancur avoids red for a tough challenge on Reece James.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think this is one of them. If he gets sent off, VAR is not bringing him back. I think it's more red than a yellow card.",
      "\"But I can understand the yellow on field. I think VAR is going to back the decision.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If he does get a red card there, I say, I understand why he got it, but then after that, I can understand as well why it's a yellow card. It's an aggressive challenge. It's one of those orange card challenges.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez is only shown a yellow card despite a studs-up high challenge on Spurs midfielder Joao Palhinha.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I definitely do not think this is a red card, his feet are up and it is a glancing blow, he has not gone through him, it is almost sideways. If he was in front and had gone through like that, he is in big trouble, but because of the angle he comes in at, he does not get the force or contact and so does not make the impact.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"I really like this decision from the ref. Enzo has tried to make an honest challenge there and just toe the ball away and as he has toe the ball away, his foot is obviously up, but his foot has hit the side of Palhinha's knee, so in that instance, it is not a reckless tackle, or a high challenge. From certain angles and a high speed, it looks a red.\"",
      "INCIDENT: West Ham have a penalty overturned by the VAR after it was deemed Malick Thiaw had got a touch on the ball first in his challenge with Jarrod Bowen.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Yes [right decision made], but I will also say when I first saw it I thought penalty, so I can understand why the referee [Robert Jones] first gave a penalty. When I saw the first replay, I knew it would be overturned.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"He has not touched the ball enough, the ball has not even changed speed, it is so minute that it should be given as a penalty, it is a crazy decision.",
      "\"You cannot say every time that you touch the ball it is not a penalty. He blocked Bowen from getting to the ball, so it is a penalty!\"",
      "The decision took over three minutes - was that too long?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It was quite protracted and that is why I do not want to see more intrusion [by the VAR], it can be slicker.\"",

      "There has been so much noise around Viktor Gyokeres this season.",
      "Is he good enough? Is he scoring enough? Is he doing enough?",
      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",
      "Gyokeres struck the opener from a corner as Mikel Arteta's side also improved on their league-leading set-piece goals tally before the striker's brilliant pass freed Leandro Trossard in the build up to Declan Rice's superb header.",
      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",
      "Gyokeres' injury will now be the concern for Arsenal - as will concerns over Martin Zubimendi, who was replaced in the second half.",
      "With Kai Havertz, Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Gabriel Jesus still out after long-term injuries, the Gunners can't afford to lose much more quality, especially in the centre-forward position.Oliver Yew",
      "Sometimes this job is a real privilege. Watching Moises Caicedo up close was a real thrill - even the Tottenham fans would have to agree. This was a performance that showcased everything you want from a world-class midfielder. Tenacious, intelligent, full of quality and affecting the game in the final third. Jamie Redknapp called him \"world class, perhaps the best of his type in world football.\"",
      "It's hard to argue.",
      "The £115m price tag had seemed to hang around his neck like a glittering weight in his early days at Chelsea but we're now seeing the player that bulldozed opposition players at Brighton.",
      "There's something N'Golo Kanté-esque about him, not just in engine or energy, but in humility. He doesn't crave the spotlight, he craves the ball. And when he gets it, the whole game dances to his tune. Xavi Simons looked almost frightened at times to dribble near the Chelsea enforcer such was the domination in the duels.",
      "He has that fear factor now. And that's one of the main reasons why he's the best in the world at what he does.Lewis Jones",
      "To beat Tottenham looks simple at the moment: defend set pieces properly and you're onto a winner. Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",
