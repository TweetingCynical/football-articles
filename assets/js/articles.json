      "Jack Wilshere and Tom Cleverley are among the candidates to be interviewed for the vacant Plymouth Argyle job. Both the former Arsenal midfielder and ex-Manchester United ace are out of work having managed in the Championship last season",
      "Plymouth are in need of a new boss having seen Miron Muslic depart for Schalke after less than a year in the job. Muslic oversaw the side's relegation after replacing Wayne Rooney at Home Park.",
      "Rooney was sacked by the club in December after lasting 221 days of his three-year contract. The ex-Derby and Birmingham City boss managed just four wins and was relieved of his duties after a nine-game winless run put the team four points from safety.",
      "Muslic was expected to continue at Plymouth having given chairman Simon Hallett assurances he would lead the side's campaign to earn promotion from the Championship. The club had already moved to put personnel and structures in place that Muslic insisted upon.",
      "But Argyle have been forced into the managerial market and could go for a high-profile name once again with Wilshere and Cleverley in the frame. The former took charge of Norwich's final two games of the season as interim-boss after the Canaries parted ways with Johannes Hoff Thorup.",
      "Wilshere arrived at Carrow Road in October 2024 as a member of coaching staff. The ex-England international was previously in charge of Arsenal under-18s and parted ways with Norwich via mutual agreement after the team decided they wouldn't consider him for the permanent job.",
      "Cleverley meanwhile saw his playing career end with Watford where he moved into coaching. The 35-year-old was working with the Hornets academy before being named as interim head coach when Valerien Ismael was dismissed.",
      "Cleverly impressed enough to be handed the role on a permanent basis but lasted little over 12 months before being sacked last month. The United academy product remained proud of his efforts.",
      "\"After the sadness wears off, I will forever have a feeling of gratitude and happiness towards the club and the place and people of Watford,\" he said. \"To have built a connection with the players and supporters over the last 14 months has been special and the achievement I’m most proud about.",
      "\"To see the development of our key players, young players and academy players, has been an incredibly rewarding part of my job and their progress in the game will always be something I look out for. We have used 11 players aged 21 and under this year and both they and the club will benefit hugely for this experience.",
      "\"To maintain league position and points after selling key players last summer is something we should be proud of, as well as reflecting on why we couldn’t sustain our play-off challenge will be something we should all review.\"",
      "Wilshere and Cleverley will also see competition from Des Buckingham. The 40-year-old was surprisingly sacked by Oxford United in December.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "He had been linked with a return to Old Trafford, while Premier League rivals Tottenham and West Ham were also credited with an interest. Despite that, Gomes has chosen to move elsewhere.",
      "According to RMC Sport, he is set to move to the French giants, who have offered the midfielder a three-year deal at the Stade Velodrome. Gomes has agreed to the move having been convinced by Roberto De Zerbi’s style of play, while the chance to play in the Champions League proved difficult to turn down.",
      "Gomes will link up with former United teammate and fellow academy graduate Greenwood with his new employers. The striker moved to France permanently last summer and went on to score 22 goals across his debut campaign.",
      "Greenwood has been linked with a move of his own amid reported interest from Barcelona but has expressed his desire to remain with Marseille. Speaking earlier this year, he said: \"I hope to be here next year for the Champions League.",
      "“All the other players tell me that the stadium is something special. I think it's been a very positive season, we've reached our objective.\"",
      "Gomes, 24, has been with Lille since leaving Old Trafford in 2021. The four-time England international has gone on to make 134 appearances for the club, scoring on ten occasions.",
      "Speaking previously, he admitted that he would potentially be open to a return to United. As quoted by L’Equipe, he said: “It was a very difficult decision. In my heart, I wanted to leave, in my head, I was thinking of staying. But I had to follow my heart. I felt that I needed to take another step in my career.",
      "\"I felt that had I stayed, there wouldn’t be a lot of opportunities for me. Luis Campos [Lille's then sporting director] and Lille spoke about their project and I believed in it even more, that’s what convinced me to move - the faith Lille had in me.",
      "\"Do I imagine myself coming back one day? Obviously, it’s home. I would love to come back. But you never know in football. I just have to keep my feet on the ground, and keep playing, making the most of it. I can’t predict what will happen in the future.\""

      "But Sporting believe that Gyokeres prefers Arsenal and the Premier League over interest from Spain and Italy. Arsenal can also offer Champions League football which is something that United cannot boast for any potential transfer targets this summer.",
      "Sporting are ready to sell the Sweden international who hit 95 goals in 100 appearances for the Portuguese club who will allow him to leave if a club comes in with just over £60m this summer. Gyokeres knows English football from his time at Brighton and Coventry but he really made his name in Portugal but is ready for a new challenge.",
      "Gyokeres himself has been tight-lipped on his plans. Asked about his future after Sporting’s final game of the season, he said: “Let's see. It’s hard for me to say, because yeah it is football and you never know what’s going to happen in the summer. So for me to say anything else than that is impossible.”",
      "Arsenal are looking for a new No9 this summer but are not decided on their top target with sporting director Andrea Berta having spoken to a number of agents, targets and clubs ahead of what will be a huge window for the club.",
      "Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is a long-time admirer of Newcastle ’s Alexander Isak but the Toon Army will not allow him to leave. RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko is also on their wish list with reports in Spain also suggesting Berta may go back to Atletico for former Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez.",
      "Arsenal also have to balance the spending to make sure they can achieve all of their targets this summer so the cost will come into it. They remain confident on landing Real Zaragoza midfielder Martin Zubimendi who has a £51m release clause.",
      "The Gunners also want a left winger and have an extensive list which includes Leroy Sane whose contract at Bayern Munich has expired and Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams.",
      "Berta has held extensive talks with a variety of different clubs and agents and Real Madrid ’s Rodrygo has been heavily linked but his price would impact heavily on any other business.",

      "Ange Postecoglou insists he has left Tottenham in a position where they will not be waiting another 17 years to lift their next trophy. On Friday, it was confirmed the Australian had been relieved of his duties, just over two weeks after beating Manchester United to win the Europa League.",
      "That was the club's first silverware since 2008, but wasn't enough to cover for a dismal domestic season which saw Spurs end the Premier League campaign in 17th place. A statement from the club says they have made what they believe 'is the right decision to give us the best chance of success going forward'.",
      "And in his own first words since the decision was announced, Postecoglou has reflected on the immense pride in leading Tottenham for exactly two years and his part in ending their trophy drought.",
      "“When I reflect on my time as Manager of Tottenham Hotspur my overriding emotion is one of pride,” Postecoglou said in a statement on social media.",
      "“The opportunity to lead one of England's historic football clubs and bring back the glory it deserves will live with me for a lifetime. Sharing that experience with all those who truly love this club and seeing the impact it had on them is something I will never forget.",
      "“That night in Bilbao was the culmination of two years of hard work. dedication and unwavering belief in a dream. There were many challenges to overcome and plenty of noise that comes with trying to accomplish what many said was not possible.",
      "“We have also laid foundations that mean this club should not have to wait 17 more years for their next success. I have enormous faith in this group of players and know there is much more potential and growth in them.”",
      "In a message to the supporters, he added: “I sincerely want to thank those who are the lifeblood of the club, the supporters. I know there were some difficult times but I always felt that they wanted me to succeed and that gave me all the motivation I needed to push on. It's important to acknowledge the hard working people at Spurs who gave me encouragement on a daily basis.",
      "“And finally, I want to thank those who were with me every day for the last two years. A fantastic group of young men who are now legends of this football club and the brilliant coaches who never once doubted we could do something special.",
      "“We are forever connected. Audere est Facere.”",

Following a positive start in the 2023/24 Premier League (PL) season, we recorded 78 points from the last 66 PL games. This culminated in our worst-ever PL finish last season.",
      "\"At times there were extenuating circumstances - injuries and then a decision to prioritise our European campaign. Whilst winning the Europa League this season ranks as one of the Club’s greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph.\"",
      "It continued: It is crucial that we are able to compete on multiple fronts and believe a change of approach will give us the strongest chance for the coming season and beyond. This has been one of the toughest decisions we have had to make and is not a decision that we have taken lightly, nor one we have rushed to conclude.",
      "\"We have a talented, young squad and Ange has given us a great platform to build upon. We should like to express our gratitude to him. We wish him well for the future - he will always be welcome back at our home.\""

      "Former Manchester United star Nemanja Matic has been handed a four-match ban for covering up an anti-homophobia logo on his Lyon shirt. The midfielder joined the French side 18 months ago from Ligue 1 rivals Rennes.",
      "Matic has been a key player for Lyon, even captaining them on occasions. He was brought on as a late substitute in their final day triumph over Angers, which helped them secure qualification for the Europa League.",
      "The final day was Ligue 1's dedicated period to show support for the LGBT+ community. The games coincided with International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia on 17 May.",
      "Clubs put a rainbow patch on their shirt sleeves, as well as a symbol which had the word 'homophobia' in French crossed out with a red line and 'football' underneath. Matic appeared on the pitch with a piece of white material covering the rainbow logo.",
      "The 36-year-old was blasted for the move by France's sports minister Marie Barsacq, who said: “Football has a massive platform, and the (French Football) Federation is determined to put this issue on the clubs’ and supporters’ agenda.",
      "“Homophobic insults and behaviour are no longer acceptable. Society has evolved, and the language in football must change with it. There’s a full range of sanctions available, and they must be applied.”",
      "He was subsequently charged by the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which governs French football. Their disciplinary committee have now confirmed the punishment, with Matic handing a two-match ban, with a further two matches suspended.",
      "He has also agreed to participate in an awareness-raising campaign on the fight against homophobia within six months. An LFP statement read: “After hearing the player, the Commission sanctioned him with a two-match suspension and a two-match suspended sentence.",
      "“Furthermore, the Commission offered the player—who immediately agreed during the hearing—to participate, within six months, in an awareness-raising campaign on the fight against homophobia in football, in collaboration with an expert association working alongside the LFP throughout the season with clubs and supporters.”",
      "Le Havre's Ahmed Hassan has been handed the same punishment after also covering up the rainbow logo on his shirt. Homophobia remains a huge problem in football, with Josh Cavallo, the first-ever top-flight star to come out, urging players to stand with LGBT+ people.",
      "“So it is quite hurtful. They don't realise how impactful that could be to the LGBT+ community. It breaks my heart every time I see something like that. It's not on. If you're a football player, you have certain responsibilities.",
      "“There's certain things you can or can't say on the pitch because you'll get sent off. There's things you can and can't do in the public right as a professional athlete. So doing that for me, is disgusting.",
      "“It's just saying you don't like associating yourself with a certain group or people, which for me is my life. So, I find it quite disgusting. Everyone wants to be your friend, everyone wants to be an ally, but when it comes to the times we to speak up together, or need support, that's when we count on our allies.”"

      "Manchester United's hopes of signing Viktor Gyokeres have been given a major boost after a key obstacle quietly disappeared. The club were thought to be outsiders in the race for Gyokeres' signature, with Arsenal leading the pack for some time.",
      "But it appears the Swedish goal machine is now open to joining the Red Devils, despite the fact that they won't be playing Champions League football next season. No formal talks have been held between United and Sporting CP, but a reunion with Ruben Amorim now looks a genuine possibility, particularly with Arsenal focusing on a deal to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Gyokeres was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in January, despite Amorim promising not to raid his old club for talent during the winter window. The Portuguese coach was as good as his word, but made no such promise about the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres, who turned 27 on Wednesday, is reportedly available for around £60million - a fee significantly lower than the £85m release clause in his contract. Given that United spent £72m on Rasmus Hojlund in 2023, that asking price may feel like a bargain.",
      "However, agent fees and Gyokeres' wage demands will need to be taken into account as well. The striker has scored an astonishing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, and despite currently earning just £39,000 per week at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, he is expected to seek a salary exceeding £250,000 per week.",
      "Only five current United players earn weekly wages of £250,000 or more. Of those, three - Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Casemiro - are likely to leave this summer, while the remaining two - Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount - have also been linked with exits.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe aiming to rein in spending amid ongoing PSR concerns, United may hesitate to meet Gyokeres' hefty demands. However, the chance to sign a striker of his calibre - especially with limited competition - could prove too tempting to ignore and a gamble worth taking.",
      "Top European sides such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City already have world-class centre forwards in place, while United's other Premier League rivals appear to be pursuing other options.",
      "Chelsea recently beat United to the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap, and although they remain in the market for another forward, Hugo Ekitike appears to be their primary target. Liverpool are reportedly eyeing the Eintracht Frankfurt star as well, potentially viewing him as a replacement for Darwin Nunez, who is expected to leave Anfield this summer.",
      "The Red Devils have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, and are looking to seal a similarly priced deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. However, with several departures anticipated across United's forward line this summer, there is room - both in the squad and on the wage bill - for further additions.",
      "Gyokeres could prove to be the ultimate statement signing - one capable of firing United back up the table following a truly dismal season. But as with so many things at Old Trafford these days, any move will require walking a financial tightrope. Whether it pays off or backfires, the consequences will be significant and unavoidable."

      "The summer transfer window has opened, but Premier League clubs are having to keep at least one eye on their compliance with Profit and Sustainability rules. The regulations state that clubs cannot post a loss of more than £105m over three seasons.",
      "Failure to comply could result in points deductions, as Everton and Nottingham Forest discovered to their cost. The end of the accounting year for 15 of next season's top-flight sides is approaching.",
      "Arsenal, Liverpool, West Ham United have already submitted theirs, with Burnley and Sunderland's accounting year ending on 31 July. Last June, several clubs were forced to make last-gasp deals to avoid breaching the PSR rules.",
      "Now, the numbers have been crunched to find out which clubs are in trouble and which teams are able to spend big this summer. The calculations, via The Athletic, deal out a headline estimate of the amount each club can lose before tax to avoid a breach.",
      "The estimate draws from figures released for the 2022-23 and 2023-24 campaigns, with the most recent one completing each club’s three-year PSR cycle. We've ranked all 20 clubs in order from least likely to breach PSR to most likely.",
      "Playing with the most space in their accounts is Chelsea, who have used a series of loopholes to build up their profits. Intra-group sales of hotels, car parks and the club's women's team have allowed the Blues to create a mammoth-sized headroom with PSR.",
      "Chelsea's pre-tax results over the past two years show a profit of £38.3m. They have further alleviated any PSR concerns over the past 12 months, ensuring the Blues should be able to spend big this summer.",
      "Brighton also have a large amount of headroom to play with, having earned a huge pre-tax profit of £208.4m over the past two years. The Seagulls are insulated from PSR concerns by their Category 1 academy as well as depreciation costs.",
      "While they missed out on qualification for European competition (that may well change), it was a solid first season under Fabian Hürzeler. He should have a bumper transfer kitty to play with this summer.",
      "Manchester City may have splurged in the January window, but Pep Guardiola's side will still be able to spend bif this summer. City have accrued a profit of £154.1m over the past two years, before allowable costs are deducted.",
      "Any lost money from early exits from the Champions League and Carabao Cup will likely be offset by this summer's Club World Cup. They are in a very healthy situation when it comes to PSR.",
      "While they have lost £120.7m over the past two years, Tottenham's stadium has allowed them to move into the black when it comes to PSR. They should be able to account for a near-£70m in depreciation costs.",
      "That means Spurs should be able to lose well over £250m in this accounting year and remain compliant. Winning the Europa League will add to the kitty, along with the incoming Champions League prize money.",
      "This is where things start to get slightly confusing. While Manchester United plc have lost a massive amount of money over recent year's, the club's PSR position is actually calculated as the accounts of Red Football Limited, a subsidiary of the plc.",
      "RFL bear none of the costs from Sir Jim Ratcliffe's share purchase and benefit from booking interest income on intra-group loans owed to RFL by entities further up the chain. It means that United's big-spending summer is likely to continue, without any PSR concerns.",
      "Arsenal's pre-tax loss is calculated at £34.6m for the past two seasons, before any more allowable costs on youth development, community expenditure and spending on the women’s team. That should hand them significant headroom.",
      "The sales of academy graduates Emile Smith Rowe and Eddie Nketiah last summer also helped. And reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League saw the Gunners bank £100m in prize money.",
      "The £100m sale of Declan Rice is the summer of 2023 remains on West Ham's books, boosting their profits to £57.2m over the past two years. Their allowable loss have dwindled though.",
      "That means they would only be allowed to lose up to £15m over the past three years. Despite that they are in little danger of breaching PSR regulations and should be able to embark on the rebuild Graham Potter desires.",
      "Despite posting a pre-tax loss of £65.3m over the past two years, Crystal Palace have received significant equity funding in recent years. That means their PSR limit is the maximum £105m allowed.",
      "They're unlikely to hit that limit, with big sales last summer of Michael Olise, Joachim Andersen and Sam Johnstone. This year's FA Cup win will also help with PSR, putting Palace in a strong position.",
      "While they had points deducted in the 2023/2024 campaign for PSR breaches, those concerns have now been eased. Their seventh-place finish in the Premier League this season has generated £34.2m in prize money.",
      "That adds to a £10.1m profit last season, having recorded more than £100m in player sales. That swung an operating loss back into the black and the prize money earned this season should allay any PSR concerns.",
      "Newcastle are now out the woods when it comes to PSR concerns, with Eddie Howe breathing a sigh of relief. The loss made in the 2022/2023 season will drop off the PSR calcuation.",
      "Continued commercial income improvements and the sales of Miguel Almiron and Lloyd Kelly to suitors abroad will also help. And qualification for the Champions League will be a serious boost to the coffers.",
      "Fulham came close to a PSR breach in 2023, but the building of their new Riverside Stand at Craven Cottage has allayed any concerns. The Cottagers have little to worry about when it comes to PSR.",
      "It is estimated that the Londoners can lose up to £77m this year and remain compliant. They have been able to utilise greater prize money, higher sale profits and the benefit of premium matchday ticketing.",
      "The Premier League champions aren't safe from PSR breaches, but they shouldn't really be concerned either. The Reds have not received equity recently, so their losses are limited to £15m over three seasons.",
      "They do, though, have sizeable allowable costs. Booming revenues and player sale profits will allow the Reds to lose up to £75m this year.",
      "Brentford have little to worry about with PSR, despite making a loss in the 2023/2024 campaign. The Bees' wider operations only allow them to make lower allowable costs than many of their Premier League rivals.",
      "They've also received no recent equity funding to bump their loss limit up. But a major improvement in prize money, coupled with the £40m sale of Ivan Toney last summer means they have no PSR concerns.",
      "Wolves decided to shift the end of their accounting year from the end of May to the end of June back in February. That move likely saved them from a PSR breach having made a loss of £73.3m over the past two years.",
      "The club banked £65.3m in player profits last summer, primarily on the sales of Maximilian Kilman and Pedro Neto. The sale of Matheus Cunha to Manchester United has taken that number even higher, putting them in a good place when it comes to PSR.",
      "Leeds have spent heavily in recent years in a bid to reach the Premier League, accruing a loss of £94.5m over the past two years. The sales of Georginio Rutter, Crysencio Summerville and Glen Kamara brought in around £70m with Rasmus Kristensen's move to Eintracht Frankfurt boosting that number.",
      "The Whites may well come close to the limit, but they should be able to avoid having to sell players before the end of June. Winning the Championship title means they should escape any PSR breach.",
      "Everton have long had trouble with complying with PSR, culminating in a points deduction. The sale of the club to The Friedkin Group has slightly eased concerns, but they have posted losses of £142.3m over the last two years.",
      "They can only lose £39m in this accounting period to avoid breaching PSR. Prize money only ticked up a small amount and last summer's big sales have not helped much. More pain could be coming for the Toffees.",
      "Bournemouth's major spending in the transfer market was only possible through a £71.4m loan being written off in their PSR calcuation. That allowed them to post a £44.5m profit in 2022/2023.",
      "The club's allowable costs are very low as well, putting them in a difficult place. But the sale of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid should help them ease their concerns, as well as increased Premier League prize money.",
      "Sunderland's eight years outside the Premier League means they’re the only club who won’t have the opportunity to benefit from at least one PSR year with an upper loss limit of £35million; instead, each of the three years within their PSR calculation are capped at an upper limit of £13m, or £39m in total.",
      "Having received no equity in recent years, their limit is actually just £15m. The Black Cats can make several deductions and made several major sales last summer, which means they should be ok, despite the estimations looking tight.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League is set to seriously cost Aston Villa when it comes to PSR. They will instead only be able to call upon the Europa League's much smaller prize pot.",
      "Villa have made several major sales in recent transfer windows and it looks likely they will have to do the same this summer, with Emi Martinez currently the man earmarked for being moved on.",
      "Burnley are in a miserable position. They are the only club who require a profit in this financial year to avoid breaching PSR and with it a potential points deduction.",
      "They have recorded a loss of £64.4m over the past two years and their recent bouncing between the top-flight and the Championship means they can record a loss of £61m over this three-year period."

      "Bruno Fernandes has been praised by former Manchester United star Ben Foster for snubbing a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia. The United skipper disclosed this week that he had rejected the chance to exit Old Trafford for Al-Hilal.",
      "The decision came despite the Saudi Pro League club's willingness to fork out an eye-watering £300million package, which included £100m for United and a £200m contract for the Portuguese midfielder. The 30-year-old playmaker turned down the offer after stating his desire to maintain his career \"at the highest level\".",
      "Ex-United goalkeeper Ben Foster has now voiced his joy at Fernandes' decision to stay put, despite questioning his sanity with a tongue-in-cheek remark.",
      "Sharing his thoughts via his Cycling GK Instagram account, the ex-Wrexham shot-stopper said: \"I'm so happy about it, because it just goes to show that some footballers actually do it for the love of the game - it's not all about money.\"",
      "\"Not only that, we want to see the best players playing in the Premier League week in, week out, and Bruno Fernandes is one of those players.\"",
      "Speaking directly to Fernandes, Foster said: \"Bruno, I don't know whether you're a little bit mad or just madly in love with football, either way, I love it, mate. I'm all over it and looking forward to watching you playing in the Premier League next season.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed at a press conference on Tuesday why he turned down a move to Al-Hilal as United plan for a rebuild under manager Ruben Amorim. Speaking while on international duty with Portugal, he said: \"There was an opportunity. The [Al-Hilal] president called me and asked if I wanted to go there.",
      "\"They were waiting for me. I spoke to coach Amorim. He asked me not to go. Manchester United didn't want to sell me. They don't need the money. If I had wanted to leave, they would have made it happen.",
      "\"It [would have been] an easy move, even at a family level. I had João Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team. We have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions and I feel capable of it.\"",
      "After a disappointing season which saw United finish 15th in the Premier League, Amorim, who succeeded Erik Ten Hag last November, is aiming to revamp his squad. The club has already made one major signing after bringing in Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, while interest has also been shown in Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "\"To turn that money down at a point where Manchester United are at their lowest ebb and say, 'No, I want to fight through this, I want to see it through the other side, I want to come out and achieve things', I think it says a lot about him as a person, as a character. The club needs people who are going to run through a brick wall for them.\"",

      "Manchester United target Bryan Mbeumo has lifted the lid on his temperament on the pitch, admitting that he's quick to get \"angry\". But the Brentford star now sees himself as a mentor, and has revealed how he has helped team-mate Yoane Wissa",
      "The Cameroon international enjoyed a fantastic season with the Bees and scored 20 Premier League goals in a formidable partnership with Wissa, who bagged 19 strikes. And that now appears to have earned Mbeumo a move away from the club.",
      "Manchester United are said to be confident of securing the former Troyes star's signature this summer, and are prepared to stump up a salary that would see Mbeumo earn five times his current wage of £50k-a-week. Brentford have turned down an opening offer of £45million plus a further £10m in bonuses, and are holding out for a £60m package.",
      "United are looking for more firepower having scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last term, and have already added Matheus Cunha to their ranks from Wolves. The Red Devils are set to beat the likes of Newcastle to Mbeumo's signature after the forward indicated his willingness to move to Old Trafford.",
      "And Mbeumo's next club have been given an indication of his temperament before completing a deal. The 25-year-old admitted he can be fiery and that Wissa has helped him manage that.",
      "\"He helped me a lot with the mental part,\" Mbeumo told BBC Sport Africa. \"I get angry really easy. He [Wissa] helped me to just stay cool.\"",
      "Mbeumo, who describes himself as an 'electrical player', has perhaps shown United chiefs he is able to show leadership off the pitch in addition to his talents on it however. The forward took Wissa under his wing upon the latter's arrival at Brentford in 2021.",
      "Wissa, 28, moved outside of France for the first time when he moved from Lorient. Mbeumo was keen to extend his experience to his team-mate having been afforded the same kindness by Julian Jeanvier and Said Benrahma, who helped him settle in.",

      "Manchester United will get a glimpse at their goalkeeping past this summer, with David de Gea poised to return to Old Trafford. United have struggled to replace De Gea since he left two years ago, after he spent 12 years between the posts for the club, and his return could serve to highlight their inadequacy in the position.",
      "Erik ten Hag chose to release De Gea and sign Andre Onana for £47million in the summer of 2023 as the Spaniard’s replacement. It was a big call by the former United boss, who worked with Onana at Ajax and was convinced he was the right player to fill De Gea’s boots.",
      "The Spaniard made 545 appearances for United, spending a decade as the club’s first-choice goalkeeper and winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Europa League and two Carabao Cups. He went through ups and downs during his time as United’s No.1 but Onana’s struggles in the past few seasons have strengthened his legacy.",
      "Now 34, De Gea is playing for Fiorentina, where he has made a brilliant start with the Italian side and earned rave reviews, helping them finish sixth in Serie A while reaching the semi-finals of the Conference League. Many United fans have noted his performances with jealousy – and they will soon get to see their former star in person.",
      "Having embarked on an ill-fated post-season tour to Malaysia and Hong Kong, United will soon be playing pre-season matches. They begin their pre-season against Leeds in Stockholm on July 19 before flying over to the Untied States for games against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side will then return to Old Trafford to play Fiorentina on August 9 before the Premier League begins again on August 16. That match against Fiorentina will see De Gea return to his old stomping ground, where he is sure to get a warm reception from United supporters.",
      "Who will be in goal for United that day remains unclear, with the club being urged to move on from Onana. The club have been linked with Aston Villa star Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain’s Gianluigi Donnarumma following another patchy campaign from Onana.",
      "The Cameroon international kept just nine clean sheets in 34 Premier League games as United came 15th. Amorim dropped him for Altay Bayindir after two shocking errors in the 2-2 draw against Lyon in April and his future is therefore uncertain.",
      "However, it seems Onana could survive the cull this summer, simply because United have bigger fish to fry. The club have already agreed to shell out £62.5m to sign Wolves forward Matheus Cunha and have also offered £50m to sign Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "While United are open to offers for any of their players, upgrading in goal is not considered to be as important as other positions. United are still hopeful that former Inter Milan and Ajax star Onana can rediscover his best form while they focus their spending power elsewhere.",

      "Onana has failed to live up to his billing since joining United in a £47million transfer from Inter Milan in the summer of 2023. The Cameroon international was signed by Erik ten Hag, who worked with him at Ajax, but his two-season stint at the club has been defined by high-profile blunders.",

Ruben Amorim dropped him for Altay Bayindir after two shocking errors in the 2-2 draw against Lyon in April and Onana faces an uncertain future.",
      "United reportedly considered a move for Aston Villa star Emi Martinez in January before sticking with Onana. But they have remained in touch with the Argentina goalkeeper and could move for him this summer, with Villa perhaps needing to sell to meet profit and sustainability rules after missing out on Champions League qualification.",
      "That would be a wise decision, according to Foster, who told talkSPORT: “It's a brutal league, the Premier League, and I kind of think [over] the last two seasons that he hasn't done enough to prove that he is a Manchester United number one.",

      "“I wouldn't bring Antony back because I've seen enough of him that he's not cut out for the club and not good enough,” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips. \"His performances are fuelled by his personality and are not for the good of the team, he’s selfish.",
      "“You will never get your £80m back from Antony. I thought it was stupid business at the time when I heard it was happening. I know that when they heard about the deal in Amsterdam, they were doing cartwheels. It shows again that players in those lower leagues, like Holland, are completely different.",
      "“They're playing very different styles, a slower tempo. Teams like Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are the best, so it's easy for them to look good. But coming into the Premier League is so much different. What is Antony’s return? How many goals and assists has he got? He's probably got as many, if not more, in Spain than in England, that different kind of football is more ideal for him.”",

      "“Garnacho is the same as Antony,” said Meulensteen. “Yes, he’s a young boy but, personality-wise, some things are not right with him and he's bad for the club. That shows in his performances and lack of consistency.",
      "“He’s a young player who has good value to him, so if they were to get offered any sort of money, they should cut their losses, because he isn’t going to live up to his potential at Old Trafford and that can free up some money to spend elsewhere.”",
      "Meulensteenalso called on Amorim to replace error-prone goalkeeper Andre Onana this summer. “It’s vital they look to replace Onana,” he said. “If you look at United's history, they started building a successful team through the goalkeeper, with Peter Schmeichel, Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea. They must bring confidence to the defence as that galvanises the whole back line.",
      "“There are some major frailties and plenty of mistakes. If there's a better goalkeeper available, they should take them. Having a really good goalkeeper lays the foundations and is massively important.”",

      "A four-time Champions League-winning spell with Real Madrid followed, before a stint with Juventus, a short-lived return to Old Trafford and an unceremonious exit to the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr. Throughout his illustrious career for club and country, in which he has mustered over 900 goals and won countless accolades, the superstar's fame has transcended football.",
      "Ronaldo is one of the most recognisable sports stars, if not celebrities, in the world, but such popularity brings with it its fair share of risk. On Wednesday, for example, a fan evaded security before Portugal's match against Germany and invaded the pitch, getting his hands around the 40-year-old before being escorted away by security.",
      "The Al Nassr forward has, therefore, often sought the help of a bodyguard, and Hichman, who served him for four years, has given insight into the sort of threats he would aim to deal with and how much he'd be paid.",
      "\"Our work depends on the client's profile. In the case of Cristiano, with whom I worked for four years, his profile wasn't high-risk because people didn't want to kill him, and he didn't receive death threats,\" Hichman told Telecinco. \"He was threatened by fans or people who wanted to rob him.\"",
      "The 36-year-old Hichman went on to detail the strategies he would employ to keep Ronaldo, his partner Georgina Rodriguez and their children safe.",
      "\"We always have to know where we're going, who will be there, and have clear entry and exit points, as well as contact points,\" he continued. \"We must always be aware that our lives could be at risk. We have to be willing to protect a person, and sometimes we have to give our lives to protect them.",

      "There have been many instances of fans running onto the pitch, as occurred during Portugal's Nations League clash this week, to try and get a close-up glimpse of Ronaldo or attempt to take a selfie with him.",
      "Yet, in April, Marca reported that Ronaldo had ramped up security efforts after threats were made against his family on social media, allegedly from a group located in Saudi Arabia, where he currently resides."

      "The 27-year-old scored 53 goals and contributed 13 assists in 51 games in the 2024/25 season, helping Sporting win the league and cup double. His prolific goalscoring has prompted lots of interest, with Arsenal understood to be at the front of the queue.",

      "It had previously appeared as though Gyokeres would not move to Old Trafford due to their lack of Champions League football next season. But that factor is now being downplayed, opening up a potential reunion with Amorim at United next season.",

      "Manchester United insist they remain compliant with financial fair play rules laid out by UEFA and the Premier League after releasing financial results that showed the picture at Old Trafford was improving.",
      "United are set to open the transfer window by spending around £120million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. A £62.5million deal for Cunha has already been agreed with Wolves, while negotiations continue with the Bees for Mbeumo.",
      "The spending has surprised some observers after United laid off around 450 staff over the previous year. Sir Jim Ratcliffe painted a bleak financial picture earlier in 2025, suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by the end of the year.",
      "United also missed out on European football for next season after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham, but they have made an aggressive start to the window as they look to reshape Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "Their latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 have revealed a more encouraging picture, and United played down concerns around breaches of UEFA's FFP rules and the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "\"The club remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules and UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Regulations,\" they said in a statement accompanying the results.",
      "These results include the salary savings after around 250 staff were made redundant last summer and show a significant reduction in costs, which has enabled the club to post a healthier picture and free up room in the budget for is privately described as \"disciplined investment in players this summer\".",
      "The result was an increase in revenues of 17.4%, mostly due to participation in the Europa League knockout stages, when a year ago, United were out of Europe entirely at this stage. Operating costs fell by 20.4%, partly due to the redundancies that have been made. There was also a reduction in the player wage budget due to a 25% salary decrease due to the club not qualifying for the Champions League",
      "Omar Berrada, CEO, said: “We were proud to reach the final of the UEFA Europa League, but ultimately, we were disappointed to finish as runner-up in Bilbao. We had a difficult season in the Premier League, which we all know fell below our standards and we have a clear expectation of improvement next season.",
      "\"We have been pleased with the performance of our women’s team, with a third placed league finish, enabling us to qualify for the UEFA Champions League and once again reaching the FA Cup final. We followed this by reaching the final of 2 the inaugural World Sevens Series. We extended the contract of head coach, Marc Skinner, reflecting the excellent work he has done with the team this season.",
      "“We remain focused on infrastructure, with the redevelopment of our Carrington training complex continuing and on track, which will be the heart of our club, providing world class facilities for all our teams and our staff.",
      "\"We have also announced our aspiration to pursue a new 100,000 seat stadium, sitting at the heart of the regeneration of the Old Trafford area, which would be a catalyst for growth and investment in our local community. We are continuing to work with all the relevant stakeholders, including central Government, to support their vision for growth.”",
      "The positive results have seen the club increase their expected revenue for the financial year ending June 2025 to £660million to £670million, which would be a return to the levels they were posting before the Covid-19 pandemic put a hole in the balance sheet."

      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last weekend, Manchester United are a third of the way towards to fixing their attack.",
      "United identified Cunha as one of their top targets for this summer's transfer window several months ago and acted swiftly to secure his signature on the opening day of the window, after triggering his £62.5million release clause.",
      "The Brazilian is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system after regularly making things happen from that area of the pitch at Molineux.",
      "However, United are maintaining discussions with Brentford and there is a growing belief they will be able to extract him from the Gtech Community Stadium amid the Cameroonian's desire to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Should United secure the 25-year-old's signature, they will sign him on the back of a 20-goal Premier League season. Only Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23) and Erling Haaland (22) scored more goals than him in the top flight this season.",
      "Just like Cunha, Mbeumo is a ready-made and proven Premier League attacker. Since the start of the 2023/24 campaign, Cunha and Mbeumo have plundered 56 Premier League goals between them.",
      "For context, that is only 45 goals fewer than what United scored collectively in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 Premier League campaigns combined. The prospect of Mbeumo joining Cunha at Old Trafford instantly strengthens United's attack.",
      "In 2024/25, United scored just 44 league goals, with only Everton (42) and the three relegated teams (36, 33 & 26) scoring fewer. Defensively, however, United boasted a better record than Brentford and Brighton & Hove Albion, who both achieved top ten finishes.",
      "United sieved 54 league goals this term, meaning they finished the campaign with a negative goal difference of -10. Of course, that record needs to improve next term, but their defensive record was not their biggest fault this campaign.",
      "United only conceded three more goals than Aston Villa and six more than Newcastle United, both of whom will play in Europe next season. The difference was that Villa scored 14 goals more and Newcastle 24 goals more than the Reds did.",
      "But less than a week into the first stage of this summer's transfer window, United are trying to bridge that gap by recruiting established Premier League attackers. Not since the 2017/18 campaign have the Reds signed attacking players on a permanent basis from a Premier League counterpart.",
      "Mbeumo would provide United with a multi-functional profile that could see him play as a No.10, a right wing-back and up front. The general consensus at this stage, though, is that he will operate as a No.10, leaving the No.9 berth in need of filling.",
      "It is no secret United are determined to sign a striker this summer, and after missing out on Liam Delap, who has joined Chelsea from Ipswich Town, it remains to be seen in which direction their search for a goal-getter will head in.",
      "They continue to be strongly linked with Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli star Victor Osimhen, who have both established themselves as two of Europe's most prolific strikers in recent seasons. Gyokeres netted 54 goals for Sporting this term and Osimhen found the back of the net 37 times on loan at Galatasaray.",
      "It means the prospect of United adding Mbeumo and Gyokeres to their crop of attackers would find themselves adding 74 goals to the 17 they have already inherited from Cunha.",
      "The prospect of ending the summer having signed three attackers that scored 91 goals in 2024/25 would represent a serious statement of intent. Of course, there are no guarantees they will replicate similar or identical numbers at Old Trafford, but United cannot be criticised for going in search of ready-made talent to come in and attempt to hit the ground running.",
      "In comparison, the last two summer transfer windows saw United gamble on potential in Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee and both moves failed to pay off.",
      "Suddenly, their biggest weakness might become their biggest strength."

      "There is plenty more to do to give Ruben Amorim the squad he wants by the start of the season, however. We have taken a look at the state of play in the window for United and what comes next.",
      "The first priority is the obvious one, and that is to get a deal for Mbeumo over the line. United have made an opening bid of £45million plus £10million in add-ons and while that falls short of the Bees' asking price, talks are continuing.",
      "Brentford want a similar fee to the Cunha transfer and United are likely to have to raise that offer to seal a deal for the 25-year-old. But he has made it clear he wants to move to Old Trafford and that is one transfer that should get wrapped up from here.",
      "Once Mbeumo is signed, United will need to assess whether they push for a striker and what sort of budget is available, having missed out on £30million Liam Delap, who opted to sign for Chelsea instead.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo can both play as strikers, although they have been used elsewhere more regularly by their current clubs. Amorim also has Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee available, although there is interest from Inter in Hojlund.",
      "Signing an out-and-out No. 9 might now depend on sales. Viktor Gyokeres is still being linked with a reunion with Amorim, despite United missing out on Champions League football, but that deal will cost twice the fee that took Delap to Stamford Bridge.",
      "Deciding on whether to sign a striker will form part of a wider discussion around what other positions need strengthening. There is certainly an argument that United need another physical deep-lying midfielder.",
      "There could be some changes in the goalkeeping department, with Andre Onana linked with the Saudi Pro League and Altay Bayindir keen to be a No. 1 elsewhere.",
      "Amorim could also push for an upgrade and increased competition at wing-back. Having signed Patrick Dorgu to play on the left in January, he could seek reinforcements on the right.",
      "Sales will form a key part of this window and the obvious starting position is the four forwards who have no future at the club. Antony, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford will all return from loan spells and now look to be sold on a permanent basis.",
      "Then there is Alejandro Garnacho, who won't be short of interest and has been told he has no future at the club by Amorim. That quartet could feasibly fetch the £120million that will go on Cunha and Mbeumo",
      "Beyond that, a buyer will be sought for Tyrell Malacia after an underwhelming loan spell at PSV. That interest in Hojlund would be considered if it is firmed up after a disappointing two seasons at the club, and more fringe players could go as Amorim looks to trim his squad for a campaign without European football.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe arguably makes Casemiro's role in the squad redundant. The five-times Champions League winner had become something of a Europa League specialist in the run to the final, but couldn't help get his side over the line in Bilbao.",
      "His Premier League performances have improved as well, but he is still exposed in some games and turns 34 in February. His place in Amorim's strongest XI looks far from assured.",
      "He is also one of the club's highest earners and shedding his £300,000-a-week wages will free up considerable headroom this summer. His form in the second half of last season might have alerted clubs that he can still perform and could increase United's chances of selling during this window.",
      "Casemiro has become a fan favourite at Old Trafford, but he could well leave."

So while Rasmus Hojlund, who has interest from Serie A, would still need to improve and show he can contribute effectively for United, the Dane or teammate Joshua Zirkee - who also struggled in front of goal last season and perhaps looks more at home in a withdrawn position - could have a future with a prolific and dynamic pair behind.",

      "It's now approaching a week since the first mini transfer window of the summer opened, with United already doing business ahead of the new season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has added forward Matheus Cunha to his squad. The Brazilian has joined from Wolves in what is a £62.5 million deal, but he is not expected to be the only incoming of the campaign.",
      "United are attempting to complete a deal for Brentford Bryan Mbeumo and reports suggest the Old Trafford club have submitted an offer to sign the 25-year-old in an initial proposal worth £45million, plus £10m in add-ons which has been rejected by the Bees.",
      "The Cameroon international has 12 months remaining on his contract, with an option, but it has been said that United are in ongoing talks.",
      "Elsewhere, United have been linked with an interest in Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, whose future at Villa Park looks uncertain. At the other end of the pitch, there has also been links with strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen, although United face plenty of competition for the dup.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "That's all from today's live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "We'll be back again tomorrow with all the latest from Old Trafford.",
      "From the outside looking in the optics around Manchester United paying big money for new signings on the back of a dismal domestic season and no European football to look forward to look, at best, confusing.",
      "Matheus Cunha arrived this past week from Wolverhampton Wanderers in a £62.5million five-year deal. Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo is next on the hit list if reports are to be believed, with the Bees man valued at over £60m.",
      "The noise heading into the summer was that United would have a £100m transfer fund to put to work in the event of no Champions League. The deals for both Cunha and Mbeumo would wipe that out and then some",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has dropped a subtle hint about his future amid ongoing transfer links with Manchester United. Ruben Amorim's side are understood to be in the market for a striker this summer and a reunion with the Sporting striker has been touted since the minute the head coach arrived at Old Trafford.",
      "The Swedish international has become one of Europe's top strikers in recent years, with an impressive record of 95 goals in 100 matches since his transfer from Coventry City to Liga Portugal in July 2023.",

      "Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres has admitted he feels at home in Portugal amid transfer links with the Reds.",
      "“In Swedish culture, people work hard during the week and if they want to do something, they do it on the weekend,\" he said in an interview with Vogue.",
      "\"Here, people also make the most of the weekdays. They come over with friends on Monday or any other day of the week, have dinner and a glass of wine.",

      "The report claims that the Magpies, who secured Champions League qualification via a fifth-place finish in the Premier League this season, are now \"pursuing a move\" for the winger, who Forest value at \"upwards\" of £50m.",
      "If Forest were to part ways with Elanga this summer, it would represent a healthy bit of profit for Forest after they signed the Sweden international for less than £20m less than two years ago.",
      "If he is sold, some of the transfer fee would be owed to United after the Reds inserted a sell-on clause in the deal that took him to the City Ground in August 2023.",
      "As it stands, the terms of the sell-on clause have not been revealed. However, clubs are typically only entitled to a share of the profits, rather than the overall fee.",
      "In this case, it means if Elanga were to be sold for £50m, which is not beyond the realms of possibility, as he has three years remaining on his current deal, then United would be entitled to a slice of the roughly £30m.",
      "It might only prove to be a minuscule fee, somewhere in the region of £3m-£6m, but as Ruben Amorim looks set to overhaul the side that so desperately underachieved this season, every penny will count.",

      "While Arsenal are busy in Germany, maybe now is the time for United to swoop in for Gyokeres.",
      "It is explained that United will be in the market for a No.9 even if the deal to sign Mbeumo is confirmed.",
      "Amorim is understood to still be a big admirer of Gyokeres having worked with him at Sporting.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window is hotting up as we sit just four days away from it temporarily closing.",
      "United have been quick to take advantage of the exceptional registration period brought about by the Club World Cup, announcing the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers on the first day of the window. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo appears to be next up on the Reds' wishlist having bagged 20 goals last season for the Bees.",
      "The Reds are firmly entrenched in talks with Brentford but their business is not expected to be concluded once Mbeumo does sign. In our latest look at the media headlines, we are going to focus on the news surrounding a couple of strikers who have been heavily linked to United.",
      "According to ESPN's Mark Ogden, Osimhen is not a target for United despite his availability. It is understood that United do not see the Nigerian as being the right fit for Ruben Amorim's forward line.",
      "Meanwhile, his £63m asking price is thought to be considered a problem for the Reds.",
      "What MEN Sport says: It is hard to see how United have come to the conclusion that Osimhen does not fit the system that Amorim is looking to build. Yes, a Viktor Gyokeres is more physically demanding but it is not as though the Nigerian is weak and unable to lead the line on his own. His goalscoring prowess speaks for itself and surely that makes him worthy of taking a gamble. Napoli's asking price could be the leading reason behind United's interest reportedly coming to an end but you have to wonder if the club are making the right call on this one.",
      "What MEN Sport says: Gyokeres' arrival would be a no-risk option for United this summer and after the season they have just endured, that could be exactly what is needed. The Swede clearly knows how to play Amorim's system and knows how to perform to incredible standards under the Portuguese head coach's tuition. Arguably, the ex-Coventry City man does not fit the image of an Ineos signing considering his age but United need less risks this window, results are needed and fast and, ultimately, Gyokeres has proven that he can deliver."

In the winter transfer window, Rashford swiftly agreed a deal to move to Aston Villa on loan after it became apparent that a route to Barcelona was closed off.",
      "Villa agreed to a £40m option to buy for Rashford at the end of the season but MEN Sport understands the West Midlands club do not hold first refusal for the winger. This increased speculation that a move to Barca could be possible, a theory which only intensified when the Catalan club's sporting director Deco spoke publicly about being interested in Rashford.",
      "Since then, the rumours surrounding Rashford's imminent departure to Barcelona have died down with the La Liga giants currently focusing on their contracted players before looking at new additions. In the meantime, Rashford has been showcasing evidence on social media of his pre-season efforts to be fit for the new campaign.",
      "In his latest Instagram post, Rashford can be seen in Cannes, France going through his rehabilitation routine. The video is captioned: \"Everyday hussle,\" and was liked by Yamal.",
      "The 17-year-old is seen as the heir to Lionel Messi at Barcelona and he has already become a key player not only for his club but his country too. Yamal scored twice on Thursday night as Spain defeated France 5-4 in the Nations League semi-finals.",

      "Considering how poorly the Manchester United season ended, many on the outside would be shocked to see how popular Ruben Amorim remains across all sections of the football club.",
      "The fanbase, notoriously the first to turn when a manager is at risk of losing their job, sing his name on a loop from the Stretford End. For the most part, the squad backs him and those that don't have quickly been spotted and offered out for permanent exits.",
      "Meanwhile in the boardroom, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his confidants remain satisfied with what he is doing. There is a consensus among all three areas of the football club that Amorim was given a rough hand when he walked into Old Trafford last November and therefore it is too early to judge him.",
      "However, how long this goodwill lasts is dependent on the start to next season, according to the words of Omar Berrada following the latest round of financial results. \"We were proud to reach the final of the UEFA Europa League, but ultimately, we were disappointed to finish as runner-up in Bilbao,\" the CEO wrote in a statement which accompanied the financial results.",
      "\"We had a difficult season in the Premier League, which we all know fell below our standards and we have a clear expectation of improvement next season.\" Berrada's statement was suitably vague as to leave plenty of wiggle room for a quick decision to be made on Amorim if it is needed.",
      "'Improvement' is not clearly defined by the CEO so, in theory, even winning a trophy may not be enough to see the Portuguese head coach keep his job. Albeit you would imagine that Amorim knows what is expected from him, on the outside looking in, that is unclear.",
      "Arguably a clear improvement would be for United to be competitive once again and be challenging in the top half of the table, not the doldrums of the lower positions. Immediately challenging for the Premier League is unrealistic, but winning the FA Cup or Carabao Cup should be a top priority and measure of success in 2025/26.",
      "While not defined in as many words, it is obvious that Amorim must oversee a positive shift next season. The manager himself admitted his job could be under threat late in the season following the team's struggles in the league.",
      "\"We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United,\" he told reporters following his side's defeat to West Ham in May.",
      "\"We don't have that fear any more and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have. It's not the players’ fault, it's my fault, I'm responsible. If we cannot change that really fast we should give our place to different people.\"",
      "Amorim will now have a summer transfer window to start shaping the squad in his own image, after which judgement can be fairly cast on his spell at Old Trafford. Support from above may be in high supply right now but if United still haven't improved by this time next year, we can expect Berrada, Ratcliffe and their colleagues to revoke their confidence in him."

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho suffered the same Manchester United fate in Bilbao. Goalscoring heroes in the FA Cup final a year ago, they were both on the bench for the Europa League showpiece against Tottenham, but while Garnacho reacted with petulance, Mainoo kept his head down.",
      "Internally, the academy graduate must have been seething. At least Garnacho was given 19 minutes to change the game. Mainoo emerged as an 89th-minute substitute, with barely any time to influence a final.",
      "It was Garnacho who stopped in the mixed zone to let rip at the decision and seal his Old Trafford exit. Mainoo kept his counsel and looks likely to remain at the club, although uncertainty over his contract remains an ongoing issue.",
      "The two 20-year-olds have followed similar paths in recent years, from FA Youth Cup triumph to forcing their way into the first team. When they scored those goals at Wembley against Manchester City, they were considered 'untouchable' in a window when almost every other player was up for sale.",
      "By January, the club were ready to listen to offers and cash in on one or both to boost their PSR position and Amorim's transfer budget. The interest in Garnacho was most concrete, and now he will be the one to go.",
      "But what of Mainoo? What does the future hold for the Stockport-born midfielder who was even shining for England in Euro 2024? He has had a difficult season, and it's become clear Amorim doesn't yet have complete faith in him.",
      "To plot his future, Mainoo will first need to know where he will be playing. Amorim has talked of him as more of a No. 10, comfortable in operating in small spaces, and has even played him as a striker, but that position is well-stocked even with Garnacho's departure. The additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo only add to the competition.",
      "Mainoo returned to a deeper midfield role towards the end of the season. It has long been where he was expected to play, but after shining as an attacking midfielder in Bucharest in January, Amorim was critical of his defensive work.",
      "\"We need time to understand the players, he was struggling a lot defending as a midfielder,\" said Amorim. \"Now more as a ten you can feel that he was so free, playing the ball near the box is really good, the small connections. We need time to work with the players and understand the best positions for them.\"",
      "Amorim has since had more time to work with Mainoo, but appears no closer to deciding his best position. He wants players who are flexible, but there is a clear need for him to specialise. It is also obvious that United are in greater need of No. 6.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' long-term future could lie there, but Manuel Ugarte hasn't totally convinced and Casemiro could leave this summer. Developing Mainoo for this position would solve a couple of problems for Amorim.",
      "Next season is the ideal time to do just that. The lack of European football means more time on the training ground. Amorim and his coaching staff will seek to use that time well, and turning Mainoo into the complete No. 6 should be one of their top priorities."

      "Tottenham’s anticipated pursuit of Brentford boss Thomas Frank could further encourage Mbeumo to seek a new challenge this summer. Spurs confirmed on Friday that they had parted ways with Postecoglou, who had spent two seasons in charge.",
      "Despite Postecoglou securing European silverware, the club's hierarchy deemed it insufficient, citing a need for change following a full-season performance review.",
      "It remains to be seen who will replace Postecoglou, but Brentford’s Frank has emerged as the frontrunner.",
      "Widely regarded as one of the most exciting managers in the Premier League, Frank has built a reputation for overachieving with limited resources. Should Spurs succeed in appointing him, players like Mbeumo may be even more inclined to move on from the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Not only that, Brentford could receive an unexpected financial windfall, with The Mirror reporting that Frank has a substantial buyout clause in his contract, last renewed in December 2022."

      "The 2024/25 season was a difficult one for every United player as the club plummeted down the division and were only saved from a relegation fight by the lacklustre displays of the three newly promoted teams. From a personal perspective, De Ligt has admitted to United's official website that he is happy with the campaign as he returned to regular football and avoided too many injury layoffs.",
      "He was signed last summer by Erik ten Hag but his reunion with the former Ajax coach lasted until October when the Dutchman was sacked and quickly replaced by Amorim. With the ex-Sporting boss' arrival came a change in defensive tact with United switching to a back three system.",
      "On the surface, it may seem like a minor change but De Ligt believes there was a noticeable difference for the players. \"For me, personally, obviously going from a two-man defence centre-back to a three-man defence, that's obviously a change,\" the Dutchman explained.",
      "\"So yeah, you change the way you play. The positions look the same but they are still quite different.",

      "\"I’ve played this system before, it’s just not that I’ve played it every week. Sometimes, certain games we played with five in the back.",
      "\"With the national team [the Netherlands], for example, we played a tournament with five in the back. That’s what I like.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo's former bodyguard has confessed that the Portuguese football icon was often 'threatened' by individuals and fans, although his life was never in danger.",
      "Having made his name at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo quickly ascended to become one of Europe's top footballers, clinching his first of five Ballon d'Or awards in 2008 as a Red Devil.",
      "This was followed by a spell at Real Madrid where he won the Champions League four times, before moving to Juventus, making a brief return to Old Trafford and then an unceremonious move to the Saudi Pro League with Al Nassr. Throughout his distinguished career for both club and country, during which he has scored over 900 goals and won numerous awards, the superstar's fame has extended beyond football.",
      "Ronaldo is one of the most recognisable sports personalities, if not celebrities, globally, but such popularity comes with its own set of risks. For instance, on Wednesday, a fan bypassed security during Portugal's match against Germany and invaded the pitch, getting close to the 40-year-old before being escorted away by security.",
      "As a result, the Al Nassr forward has frequently enlisted the services of a bodyguard, and Hichman, who worked for him for four years, has provided insight into the type of threats he would typically handle and how much he was compensated.",
      "\"Our work depends on the client's profile. In the case of Cristiano, with whom I worked for four years, his profile wasn't high-risk because people didn't want to kill him, and he didn't receive death threats,\" Hichman told Telecinco. \"He was threatened by fans or people who wanted to rob him.\"",
      "The 36-year-old security expert also shed light on the protective measures taken to ensure the safety of Ronaldo, his partner Georgina Rodriguez, and their family.",
      "\"We always have to know where we're going, who will be there, and have clear entry and exit points, as well as contact points,\" he added. \"We must always be aware that our lives could be at risk. We have to be willing to protect a person, and sometimes we have to give our lives to protect them.",
      "\"If I have to use weapons, I will use them. The most important thing is having the ability to think quickly, solve problems, and remain calm in difficult situations.\"",
      "Reflecting on his role, Hichman admitted that he would typically earn around £850 per day working for Ronaldo, whom he lauded as an amazing boss despite not working for the superstar anymore.",
      "\"He is the best boss I've ever had,\" Hichman detailed. \"We have a good relationship. Working with him wasn't like working with someone threatened with death or kidnap. We had some silly incidents with paparazzi or crazy fans, but nothing major.\"",
      "Aside from making life difficult for photographers and trying to keep Ronaldo's family out of the public eye as much as possible, Hichman revealed that he never dealt with serious threats to the 40-year-old.",
      "There have been many instances of fans running onto the pitch, as occurred during Portugal's Nations League clash this week, to try and get a close-up glimpse of Ronaldo or attempt to take a selfie with him.",
      "Yet, in April, Marca reported that Ronaldo had ramped up security efforts after threats were made against his family on social media, allegedly from a group located in Saudi Arabia, where he currently resides."

      "A fan on social media has suggested making a tifo with Bruno Fernandes' head on Belfort's body with the quote written across it, but it would never be approved by Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes' explanation for staying at Old Trafford - he spoke at a press conference on Tuesday night - certainly wasn't as dramatic as Belfort's for staying at Stratton Oakmont.",
      "Al-Hilal are the most successful club in Saudi Arabia and a huge financial package was on the table for Fernandes, but their interest was rebuffed and he will remain in Manchester.",
      "\"It was a very exciting offer. The president of Al Hilal was very nice to me,\" said Fernandes.",

      "\"She's always been behind me with every decision. It would have been easy to change, even from a family point of view, as Ruben Neves and João Cancelo are there [with Al-Hilal].",
      "\"Our kids are used to each other, I'm used to them, but I want to play at the highest possible level, playing in the major competitions and I know I still can. And I'm happy about my decision.\"",
      "Fernandes' decision to stay must be considered as excellent news. He has been the greatest signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, he is the standard setter in the dressing room and just won a fourth Player of the Year award.",
      "United would have banked a significant transfer fee for a player who will turn 31 in September, but nobody would have trusted the club to reinvest it sensibly in the transfer market.",
      "Fernandes' decision has been celebrated, although it will have implications for others in the dressing room, who might have been better off if the club captain had packed his bags.",
      "Manuel Ugarte probably falls into that category because Fernandes is expected to predominantly play in the midfield pivot next season. United have signed Matheus Cunha and they want to sign Bryan Mbeumo, so that pair will occupy the No.10 roles, provided Mbeumo also arrives from Brentford.",
      "Fernandes increasingly played in the deeper midfield role as the season progressed, and there are doubts about whether a partnership with Ugarte is solid enough to move up the table.",
      "There have been some good displays from Ugarte, sometimes alongside Fernandes in the pivot, but Amorim will be unsure whether they are a good enough midfield pairing for next season.",
      "If Fernandes had decided to join Al-Hilal, a new midfielder would have been brought in this summer to play alongside Ugarte, but it now feels like Ugarte will be the player facing the axe from the starting XI.",
      "To make Fernandes work in the No.8 role, a higher-quality midfield partner will be required, and it's disappointing that United might already need to sign a player of that ilk after splashing £42.3m on Ugarte.",
      "There is also the question of where Kobbie Mainoo fits in Amorim's plans next season. Does he play in deeper midfield? Cunha and Mbeumo should be the first choice in the No.10 roles.",

The Brazilian has made the £62.5 million move and has penned a five-year contract, with the option of a further 12 months.",
      "While United have splashed out a considerable fee for Cunha, more are expected to follow. Ruben Amorim's side have seen a bid - believed to be worth £55m - rejected by Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo. The Reds are anticipated to return with a second offer for the talented Cameroonian.",
      "As well as Cunha and Mbeumo, United are expected to target a new No.9. Viktor Gyokeres as emerged as the favourite to fill that role after it emerged that he is 'open' to signing for United.",
      "Elsewhere, United could look to add another goalkeeper with Emiliano Martinez linked, but the focus is set to be on departures. Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are three players that have been tipped to leave Old Trafford, while Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund might follow.",
      "Wirtz, 22, is closing in on a £109m move to Liverpool and Leverkusen are expected to dip into the transfer market for a replacement.",
      "And Antony, who was signed by new Leverkusen head coach Erik ten Hag at United, has emerged as a candidate following an impressive loan spell at Real Betis.",
      "Antony, 25, spent the second half of the season in Seville and impressed, scoring nine goals and providing five assists in 26 matches. His performances not only helped Betis mount a competitive run in La Liga, but also aided their run to the Conference League final.",
      "MEN says: For Antony, I think he should avoid the temptation of teaming back up with Erik ten Hag and moving to Leverkusen. Yes, Ten Hag's side are in the Champions League and that would be a major pull, but he suited Spanish football down to the ground and that is where he should return.",
      "Therefore, a move back to Betis would be recommendation. He flourished in La Liga during the second half of the season and I think he can continue that form if he moved there in a permanent deal.",
      "Manchester United are open to offers for Casemiro in the summer transfer window, according to The Telegraph. The 33-year-old is reportedly the highest earner at Old Trafford and United want to sell him to free up funds for players coming in.",
      "Casemiro is under contract until 2026 and United have the option to extend his deal for a further 12 months. But the Brazilian could be heading for the exit doors if another club makes a bid for him before the start of next season.",
      "MEN says: Casemiro may have impressed near the end of the season, but I do still think United need to cash in and sell the midfielder. Getting his reported £350,000 per week wages off the books would be ideal and I believe that United can use that to free up space for another midfielder to come through the door.",
      "A proven Premier League performer, such as Fulham's Sander Berge, is someone I would look at. United need players that can come in and do the job instantly, rather than signing players for the future."

The Cameroon international has indicated he is keen on a move to Old Trafford.",

      "He has long been linked with a move to the Premier League, and this summer is no different, with Old Trafford touted as a potential destination for the Nigeria international. However, it now appears that Saudi Arabian giants Al Hilal are moving to steal a march on European clubs.",
      "According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Al Hilal have submitted an official bid to Napoli, having identified Osimhen as their top transfer target this summer after being turned down by Bruno Fernandes. The offer reportedly consists of a €65 million fixed fee, plus an additional €5 million in add-ons. The ball is now in Napoli’s court as they weigh up whether to accept or reject the proposal.",
      "It has previously been reported that Osimhen’s release clause stands at around €75 million, but Napoli’s eagerness to part ways with the striker could weaken their negotiating position, especially after they allowed him to leave on loan last season when no clubs were willing to meet the asking price.",
      "Romano adds that Al Hilal are also in contact with the player’s camp over personal terms, though it remains unclear whether they can reach an agreement with Osimhen or Napoli. The Saudi side will be participating in this summer’s FIFA Club World Cup, giving them extra incentive to wrap up the deal quickly.",
      "As for United, Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves, while Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo has emerged as another key target. With ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of Rasmus Hojlund, another striker addition could be on the cards, hence the reported interest in Osimhen and Sporting CP’s Viktor Gyokeres."

      "Telford, who boasts 27 caps for England between the sticks, believes the squad’s remaining goalkeepers will suffer for the loss of Earps’ experience in Switzerland.",
      "“For me, it's a huge loss in terms of the GK union,” she said. “It's always super important to have some experience in there.",
      "“You'd be shocked when any player that plays well retires and probably think it's too early, or it's an age where they shouldn't, but there's never an age that you should or shouldn’t retire.",

      "“It would have taken months of conversations with family, with friends, with teammates, with coaches, to work out, ‘Is this the right thing for me? How do I feel when I put on that shirt? How do I feel when I go to camp?’”",
      "Earps, 32, was England’s number one when they won the Euros in 2022 in a historic summer for women’s football and kept that spot for the Lionesses’ run to the final a year later, when she was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year.",
      "The former Manchester United goalkeeper has also been influential off the pitch, notably inspiring with award acceptance speeches and winning a battle with Nike to get women’s goalkeeper replica shirts on sale.",
      "“Her journey's been her journey, and it has been an incredible one,” added Telford.",
      "“What she's done for English goalkeeping, and goalkeeping in general, and for women, has been something that's probably unheard of in the women's game in England, as an individual. I can't thank her enough for that.",

      "On that occasion, an injury to Bardsley in the World Cup quarterfinals saw Telford called upon for the semi-final encounter with the USA.",
      "“It's really difficult because there's a part of you that knows that you're probably never going to play, but also there's always a what if,” added Telford, who is partnering with Sure to give young girls the authentic role models they deserve in a sport that is growing exponentially.",
      "“What I learned on my journey as a goalkeeper is not to be like, ‘Oh, I'm not going to play, I'm not going to be bothered.’",

      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",
      "Sancho was one of a few wingers in the Blues’ rotation last season. On loan at Stamford Bridge, he joined Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto in the group of wide men who played most often.",
      "Chelsea had an obligation to sign Sancho permanently from United for £25million this summer, but reneged on it for a fee of £5million, as they couldn’t come to an agreement on personal terms with the winger, who earns £250,000 per week at Old Trafford.",
      "As such, Caught Offside suggests they are looking to replace Sancho, and could do so with his United team-mate. Indeed, they state Chelsea ‘remain’ interested in Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "They were interested in his signing in the winter, and the potential of him being sold was advanced by Ruben Amorim reportedly telling him on United’s post-season tour: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "It’s believed the Red Devils are indeed willing to sell Garnacho, with Caught Offside stating he’ll cost €55million (£46.3m).",
      "The winger is said to be a ‘tempting option’ for Chelsea given he fits their philosophy of signing ‘elite young talents for their long-term project’.",
      "But, the Blues both have competition for Garnacho – with Napoli, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all after him – and are looking at another exciting forward themselves.",
      "They have been linked with Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens for some time, and it’s stated that they are still ‘looking closely’ at the 20-year-old.",
      "MORE ON CHELSEA FROM F365:\n👉 Man Utd target £32m Chelsea star in stunning summer deal as Red Devils ‘meet’ £13m Mbeumo demands\n👉 Mbeumo confusion explained by biggest signings made by clubs ‘pushing the train’ to Champions League\n👉 Chelsea ‘offered’ West Ham star ‘certain to’ join Champions League club for £76m",
      "There is reportedly a race against time for the signing of Gittens at Chelsea. They play in the Club World Cup, which begins on June 15, and it was recently stated the Blues were in talks over a deal, and want to wrap it up before the tournament.",
      "It’s believed the Dortmund man is expected to attract bids of about £50million, with a release clause in his contract of a value around that.",
      "Whether Chelsea can get Gittens through the door for the Club World Cup will of course depend on if they can agree a deal with Dortmund, but there is a clear focus on the future, hence interest in two 20-year-olds, in him and Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘desperately searching’ for a buyer for a flop signing, as they have been torn to pieces by former coach Rene Meulensteen, who labelled his signing “stupid ...",
      "Ex-Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster has hit out at Alejandro Garnacho’s behaviour this season and thinks his haircut in the Europa League final summed him up.",
      "Chelsea are ‘working on a verbal agreement for Hugo Ekitike’ and have ‘made a bid’ for a winger to beat Liverpool in a £140m double Bundesliga swoop.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are interested in signing Man Utd centre-back Lisandro Martinez this summer as well as Alejandro Garnacho, according to reports.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer.",
      "Chelsea have seemingly made up their mind about Man Utd winger Jadon Sancho as they chase a deal for Dortmund star Jamie Gittens, according to reports."

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘desperately searching’ for a buyer for a flop signing, as they have been torn to pieces by former coach Rene Meulensteen, who labelled his signing “stupid business.”",
      "United have just completed their worst season in Premier League history. Never before have they finished as low as 15th in the table.",
      "Some players ended the season with credit in the bank, though they were largely the ones who were not actually representing United. Indeed, Antony headed out on loan to Real Betis for half the season, where he scored nine goals and assisted five.",
      "It was felt that might have put him in contention for a place back at United, though GIVEMESPORT states Antony ‘still has no future’ under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Indeed, it’s stated the club are ‘desperately searching for a buyer’ for the winger. Their preference is to offload him permanently, and United will ask for just £30million in order to do that.",
      "They have, though, refused to rule out a loan with an obligation to buy if no buyers come forward before the back end of the window, and it’s felt Betis have a ‘golden opportunity’ to land Antony on loan again after his first period there.",
      "Former United coach Meulensteen, who was Sir Alex Ferguson’s right-hand man, is in agreement that Antony should not return.",
      "“I wouldn’t bring Antony back because I’ve seen enough of him that he’s not cut out for the club and not good enough,” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",
      "“His performances are fuelled by his personality and are not for the good of the team, he’s selfish. You will never get your £80m back from Antony. I thought it was stupid business at the time when I heard it was happening.",
      "“I know that when they heard about the deal in Amsterdam, they were doing cartwheels. It shows again that players in those lower leagues, like Holland, are completely different. They’re playing very different styles, a slower tempo.",
      "“Teams like Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are the best, so it’s easy for them to look good.",
      "“But coming into the Premier League is so much different. What is Antony’s return? How many goals and assists has he got? He’s probably got as many, if not more, in Spain than in England, that different kind of football is more ideal for him.”",
      "Another player United are willing to sell, Alejandro Garnacho, has not impressed Meulensteen.",
      "“Garnacho is the same as Antony. Yes, he’s a young boy but, personality-wise, some things are not right with him and he’s bad for the club. That shows in his performances and lack of consistency.",
      "“He’s a young player who has good value to him, so if they were to get offered any sort of money, they should cut their losses, because he isn’t going to live up to his potential at Old Trafford and that can free up some money to spend elsewhere.”",
      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",
      "Ex-Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster has hit out at Alejandro Garnacho’s behaviour this season and thinks his haircut in the Europa League final summed him up.",
      "Jadon Sancho could replace Antony at Real Betis this summer as Man Utd set their price for the Brazilian, according to reports.",

      "There’s encouragement from Europe for Arsenal and Manchester United fans, but Manchester City’s urgency is evident…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🔽 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nRashford wants to join Barca. Of course he does. And Barca might be willing to accommodate him if they can’t get other targets. But Rashford certainly seems more motivated than Barca, which is a problem for the striker and United. If it happens, it won’t be any time soon. And it will almost certainly be a loan deal to start.",
      "",
      "19) Nico Williams – Athletic Bilbao to Arsenal\nOwing to Williams’ not-prohibitive release clause, this should be relatively simple if Arsenal really want to do it. But their interest is complicated by other costs that might be involved in signing the winger, for whom a new deal in Bilbao is not out of the question. This one seems to be getting further away, not closer. And it’s hard to ignore the spectre of Barca here.",
      "",
      "18) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nLiverpool were linked with the France forward but Chelsea have made an approach to Eintracht Frankfurt. The Blues’ problem: the Germans want £85million and they have little motivation to dramatically lower that demand.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus 🆕 – West Ham to Chelsea\nThere’s a lot of noise around Kudus in recent days, the most recent suggesting he’s been offered to Chelsea for £85million. Kind offer, but not one the Blues are likely to take West Ham up on without a hefty discount. Robert Sanchez could be a makeweight.",
      "",
      "16) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Napoli\nRuben Amorim has made it painfully clear that Garnacho has no future at Old Trafford, which is a problem when they are asking for £60million. Napoli will not pay that. We await the awkwardness of Garnacho returning to United for pre-season before the serious conversations start.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window\n👉 Wirtz next? The last five times every Premier League club broke transfer record",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal seemed to be heavy favourites to land Gyokeres but the Gunners are faffing while they suss out which striker they can do a better deal for. Right now, it’s gone a little quiet between Arsenal and Gyokeres and there seems to be more noise around the other fella.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nMartinez seems to have said his goodbyes to Villa and though he was linked with Barcelona, it seems the Catalans are pushing forward on a deal for Joan Garcia. There is renewed speculation of United’s intent to move for Martinez, for whom they made an offer in January, according to one report.",
      "👉 Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "",
      "13) Viktor Gyokeres 🆕 – Sporting to Manchester United\nWitH Arsenal yet to make a decision, there are plenty of reports that Gyokeres is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "10) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to West Ham\nGiven Ramsdale’s habit of getting relegated, do West Ham really want to do this? Apparently so. Talks have taken place, with the Hammers set to be liable for £20million unless they can play on the fact Saints want the keeper’s £100k-a-wages off their books.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nApparently unmoved by the Champions League, Mbeumo has stated his preference for United over Newcastle, Arsenal and Spurs, but Brentford, not unreasonably, want a similar fee to that the Red Devils gave Wolves for Matheus Cunha. A first bid went in – £45million plus £10million – which was doomed to fail. A second ‘take-it-or-leave-it- offer is imminent.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker has overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack.  After much deliberation, it seems the Gunners favour a deal with RB Leipzig over whatever they could get out of Sporting. Talk have taken place ‘in the last 48 hours’ and seem to be progressing nicely.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Chelsea are said to be offering £10million for now, so there is some talking to be done. But whatever they pay up, it will be worth it.",
      "6) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool may have had one bid worth £109million turned down but the Reds have gone balls out for Wirtz and they won’t walk away over a few euros, especially when the player has matched their intent by stating he wants Anfield over the Allianz Arena. Once Wirtz gets international duty out of the way this weekend, we can expect some progress.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "5) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. Reports suggest there is no reason for Arsenal fans to panic, with agreements in place between all parties. We’ll see next week after the international break.",
      "4) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity got the easy part – they have agreed personal terms with Cherki – done early and have reportedly struck a deal with Lyon. City are in a hurry, so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed in the next week.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord is it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides.",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Rayan Ait-Nouri – Wolves to Manchester City \nEveryone seems to be going with the line that a deal is done for what looks like a knockdown £33.7million fee. City want it done before next week and a medical is imminent."

      "“Cunha and Mbeumo have obviously got Premier League experience. They’ve got plenty of games under their belt. [English football] is not new to them and actually they are the right type.",
      "“When I watch Manchester United wide players, they have to be able to get from box-to-box quickly. They have to be able to run, to travel with and without the ball. Mbeumo and, to be fair Cunha, can do that.",

      "And Man Utd have ‘set their sights on Vanderson’ who plays for Monaco with his profile ‘perfectly suited to the style of play they want to establish starting next season, and initial contacts have already taken place’.",
      "The ‘financial offer’ that the Red Devils are willing to make is €30m (£25m) and French side Monaco are ‘seriously considering’ the deal, ‘taking into account the current market situation and the interest from other clubs’.",
      "Man Utd see the ‘player’s youth is seen as a key asset, with room for improvement and sufficient experience at club and international level’.",

      "Heskey told Poker Scout: “Matheus Cunha had a fantastic season for Wolves, where the pressure was on at one point to stay up – he did well. He finds little pockets of space and is very intelligent. He has a great eye for goal and is the type of player that Manchester United need.",
      "“Bryan Mbuemo is probably the best winger in the league bar Mohamed Salah – that would be a great piece of business.",

      "“There’s a case for them having to pay more to get these players through the door, but that pull is clearly still there. They’re a huge club that are currently going through problems, but they will always attract players. At this point, those players must be the right ones. Cunha and Mbuemo can hopefully be that for them.”",
      "Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres has now emerged as a possible target for Man Utd as he is willing to make the move to Old Trafford despite no European football.",
      "Heskey added: “Viktor Gyokeres would be a good signing for Manchester United. He has already played under Ruben Amorim and has played in England before. He has already shown that he can play in the system that Amorim prefers, he looks ideal.",
      "“His goal record this season was brilliant, he knows what the club means having played in England and he would fit well into Amorim’s system.”"

      "Selfish Bruno must go\nI see LOH has still not grasped the concept of “team player”. But first, since you mentioned Rashford, no one has said he was the bastion of great attitude *off* the pitch. Apparently, his main crime *on* the pitch is not being a pressing forward. If you’re going there, maybe we should castigate Bruno for not being able to tackle? I couldn’t give a rats about what a player does that isn’t illegal off the pitch. Garnacho apparently trains well. Shame he can’t deliver when it actually matters.",
      "I’m sure off the pitch Bruno is a model professional, but on the pitch he’s a whiny baby who will often prefer to shout at someone (referee, team mates, the sky, the grass) rather than get back into position or show for the pass. He spent a solid 30 seconds in one incident in the EL Final, when Maguire was desperately trying to pass to him, shouting at someone or other rather than paying any attention to the actual match actually going on and that we were losing to actual Spurs. If you don’t recall the match, it’s one of those “off” games that Bruno has occasionally – usually when we face anyone decent or who sit deep.",
      "Bruno was never world class. No (other?) big club has ever shown interest in him. He can create chances, as long as they mostly involve pinging the ball out wide. Down the middle, not so much. You want to give him huge credit for passing to Mainoo? It was decent for sure, but the movement by Mainoo for it (and the finish), and arguably the Rashford ping out to Garnacho, was better. The fact that this kind of pass is so unusual as to be worth mentioning is telling in itself.",
      "As far as selfish, yes, I stand by that. He’s missed as many big chances as he’s created all season, certainly in the league. Missed. Those were opportunities where a less selfish player would look for the pass to someone in a better position. I wonder where Garnacho got this “me first” attitude? Yes, he’s seemed to produce good numbers. In a team where he is the sole focus of creating chances. That he led to two of our worst finishes back to back. Brilliant!",
      "In the context of the club, yeah that’s a little tongue in cheek but it was him that said he would go if the club decided to let him. Then they let him, and he decided not to. Because HE doesn’t want to play at a lower level. And while I get that, he’s only going to be declining from here on. 31 when the season starts. Him staying has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else but his ego, just like his Hollywood passes.",
      "The sad thing is that this makes a problem for everyone else in the squad. Mainoo has been promised to play at 8 as a regular starter if he signs da ting. And we’re now signing two other 10s, with the supposed view that Amad moves to RWB.",
      "So, where does that leave the two new signings, and Mount. And Collyer. And Casemiro. Seems like once again Bruno was out the door – as it was when we signed Mount – only to turn around and come back in after he’s been replaced.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "12) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "13) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "14) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "15) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "16) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "17) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "18) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",
      "",
      "19) Diego Costa – £57m/€65m (Chelsea to Atletico Madrid, December 2017)\nProof that Chelsea used to be incredible at this transfer lark: they signed Liverpool target Diego Costa from Atletico for £32m in 2014 and built two title-winning teams around his 20-goal seasons, before Antonio Conte dumped the Spain international over text and theoretically torched his valuation by publicly ostracising him, yet Atletico – serving a transfer ban – bought the 29-year-old back for £25m more than they sold him despite Costa not having played for months. And in a miserable second Atleti spell, he scored 19 goals in 81 games, moving to Brazil for free before they won the title.",
      "",
      "20) Edinson Cavani – £55.6m/€64m (Napoli to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2013)\n“The transfer of Edinson Cavani is further proof of the club’s ability to attract the best players in the world. The player was seduced by the club’s sporting project,” added PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi, and those tittering in the back can shush. Can’t complain after 200 goals and 21 trophies.",

      "A Manchester United flop is reportedly ‘not satisfied’ with his time at Old Trafford, and could look to return to the last country he played in, where a Champions League finalist is interested in him.",
      "Almost no United players had good seasons last time out. Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo were probably the only vaguely positive stories in an otherwise very underwhelming campaign.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final. In the league, central strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both played over 30 games, but neither man managed more than four goals.",
      "Hojlund scored four in 32 games, and according to Caught Offside, he’s not enjoying his time at United and could look to go back to Italy, where he was signed from.",
      "Indeed, Alfredo Pedulla wrote for the site: ‘Finally, keep an eye on Rasmus Hojlund. The Dane is not satisfied with his time in Manchester and is considering a return to Italy. Several clubs (including Inter) are interested in him and he’d be an excellent option for those seeking a dynamic and already proven striker.’",
      "It would be a shocking turn of events if a striker who was not able to reach five Premier League goals for United managed to secure a transfer to a Champions League finalist.",
      "However, Inter have indeed been linked with Hojlund. In May, an Italian outlet suggested Inter headed the queue for Hojlund, as he’d been made the dream signing for the attack a couple of years ago, before eventually going to United.",
      "Despite the Dane having had a very underwhelming season, Inter’s interest has not faded. They reportedly see his poor seasons as an ‘accident along the way’ to him becoming a top striker.",
      "It’s believed they wanted him on a loan with an obligation to buy him. Whether that formula is still the way they are going to go is unclear, but Pedulla certainly suggests that Inter still want Hojlund.",
      "In one season in Italy, with Atalanta, the striker scored 10 goals in all competitions and assisted four more. He scored more than that in his first season at United, but did much worse this term.",

      "Man Utd love spending vast sums on teenage prodigies but even they cannot boast the most expensive Premier League signing ever under the age of 20.",
      "These right here are the most expensive teenage signings in Premier League history. Lewis Hall and Estevao Willian could eclipse some of these figures if they activate clauses in their transfers to Newcastle and Chelsea respectively.",
      "Konstantinos Karetsas could make this list if he joins Arsenal.",
      "",
      "10) Anderson (£30m)\nOne did not simply play for Man Utd between 2007 and 2015 without spending at least some of the intervening time appearing on some sort of podcast and suggesting Anderson could have been the greatest footballer in history if he wasn’t obsessed with McDonald’s.",
      "The literal Golden Boy of 2008 made his move to Old Trafford alongside Nani the previous summer, making 38 appearances in his debut season and never surpassing that figure in seven further campaigns.",
      "The Brazilian arguably fit enough into 2007/08 to make it all worth it, coming on in the final minute of stoppage time in extra-time to convert a sudden death penalty with his first kick of the Champions League final, immediately after John Terry lost his footing.",
      "",
      "9) Gabriel Jesus (£31m)\n“We look forward to him making a big impact at Manchester City in January,” said Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain in August 2016, discussing the relatively unknown Gabriel Jesus.",
      "A lauded talent within Brazil, it was nevertheless striking to see the Premier League commit such figures on a teenager in Pep Guardiola’s first transfer window.",
      "That “big impact” was almost unfathomably quick from Jesus when he did arrive at the Etihad the following January. It was decided that Jesus would stay in Brazil to complete their league season and inspire Palmeiras to a first national championship in 22 years, being named player of the year in the process.",
      "With Jesus making his Selecao debut in September 2016, scoring five goals and assisting four in his first six caps by the end of the year, having helped guide his country to Olympics gold a fortnight after the confirmation of his impending move to England, it was clear Manchester City had spotted a talent. Four Premier League titles and 95 goals before being sold at a substantial profit to Arsenal six years later only underlined it.",
      "",
      "8) Luke Shaw (£31m)\nIt is often underestimated just how callow – and how brilliant – Shaw was in his early Premier League days. Wayne Rooney remains the only player to make his 50th appearance in the competition at a younger age (18 years, two months and four days), with Shaw matching Milner (18 years, seven months and 17 days) and beating Cesc Fabregas by about a week.",
      "The left-back was a PFA Team of the Year member and Young Player of the Year candidate – beaten by Eden Hazard so fair enough – before he took the genuinely arguable step back of leaving that wonderful Southampton team for Louis van Gaal’s sterile revolution.",
      "No-one would choose differently in the same position but it is a shame just how much Shaw has struggled even just for fitness at Old Trafford. It is probably best for everyone to move on.",
      "",
      "7) Yakuba Minteh (£33m)\nNewcastle turned a profit in the region of £28million on a player who never played a senior game in black and white. It’s entirely possible Minteh never even trained with Eddie Howe’s squad.",
      "The Gambia winger signed for the Magpies in summer 2023, from Danish side OB. Immediately, he was loaned to Feyenoord, where he scored 10 goals. The expectation was for Minteh, now 19, to return to Newcastle and push for a first-team place, but PSR put paid to that.",
      "With Newcastle desperate for cash before June 30 and even more reluctant to sell any established stars, they snatched the £33million Brighton were offering and diverted Minteh’s path to the AmEx.",
      "",
      "6) Archie Gray (£35m)\nNewcastle didn’t really want to part with Minteh, but selling Gray was an even bigger wrench for Leeds.",
      "When the final whistle blew at the Championship play-off final to condemn Leeds to another season of second-tier scrambling, immediately the focus at Elland Road switched to sales. Gray, a prodigious, versatile England Under-21 international, was comfortably their most sellable asset, despite the sour taste that selling one of their own might leave.",
      "With Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund among those linked, it was a surprise to see Brentford emerge as the frontrunners when they agreed to pay Gray’s release clause and impressed the player and his family with their plans to make him a star.",
      "Despite the Bees’ intent, it always seemed a ploy to smoke out some of the bigger hitters. Tottenham stepped up, with the lure of Ange Postecoglou one of the factors swinging it for Spurs. And now he’s a Europa League winner.",
      "",
      "5) Fabio Silva (£35.6m)\nAbsolutely ludicrous, that. Portuguese authorities clearly agreed as the fee, a club-record transfer for Wolves at the time, was investigated as part of a wider operation exploring issues with agents and third-party payments.",
      "Eyebrows might have been raised when Porto commanded such preposterous money for a teenager with a single league start and goal to his name. Silva’s entire professional career consisted of 781 minutes and three goals when Jorge Mendes worked his magic.",
      "The forward did at least improve on that at Molineux, netting four times in the Premier League; he has been more prolific on loan at each of Anderlecht, PSV, Rangers and Las Palmas since, yet still has a year left on his Wolves deal.",
      "MORE ON FOOTBALL’S BIGGEST EVER DEALS\n👉 The 20 most expensive goalkeepers ever\n👉 The 20 most expensive defenders ever\n👉 The 20 most expensive midfielders ever\n👉 The 20 most expensive attacking midfielders ever\n👉 The 20 most expensive forwards ever\n👉 The 20 most expensive strikers ever",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana (£36.5m)\nBrendan Rodgers might have been onto something when he said that new Leicester signing Fofana “looks like he’s played for a lot longer,” considering the centre-half had barely racked up 100 senior career appearances yet still earned transfers worth around £111.5m.",
      "A single season at Saint-Etienne – the premature 2019/20 at that – was enough to persuade the Foxes that Fofana was worth comparatively silly money, much like his one full campaign at the King Power Stadium tempted Chelsea into making him then one of the most expensive defenders ever less than two years later despite the Frenchman suffering a long-term injury in the interim.",
      "The most games Fofana has played for any one club remains the 52 he managed at Leicester. Next is 34 at Chelsea, 30 at Saint-Etienne and one with France.",
      "",
      "3) Anthony Martial (£44.7m)\n“It was a ridiculous amount of money, but it’s the crazy world we are in,” said Louis van Gaal. “I have not bought Martial for me – I have bought him for the next manager of Manchester United.“",
      "That he went on to vouch for the candidacy of Ryan Giggs to that role remains hilarious.",
      "Martial did at least have some first-team pedigree when a panicking Man Utd came calling in September 2015. The Frenchman had played 70 games and scored 15 goals. But as French football journalist Philippe Auclair said at the time: “This amount of money leaves people speechless in France.”",
      "With Monaco banking an initial fee of £36m, add-ons made up the rest of the £57.6m total possible payment. Martial triggered one clause by scoring well over 25 goals in his first four seasons, but he failed to hit the requisite number of France caps and – somehow – did not win the Ballon d’Or to activate another instalment.",
      "Little did Van Gaal know that he had bought Martial for the next few managers of Manchester United, nor that he would become a burden to each of them.",
      "",
      "2) Leny Yoro (£52m)\nUnited need to hope their latest French prodigy lives up to the billing rather better.",
      "Yoro wanted to join Real in summer 2024 but their reluctance to get close to the amount United were willing to pay for a player a year from free agency was perfectly understandable. As was Lille’s insistence on Yoro moving to United given the mental sum of money being dangled before them.",
      "It could yet turn out to be a stroke of genius on United’s part. The first season was a disaster, but a tiny fraction of the responsibility can be apportioned to the defender.",
      "",
      "1) Romeo Lavia (£53m)\nA player so young that even if he serves the entirety of his compulsory seven-year contract with Chelsea, Lavia will still only be 26 and hitting his prime when it expires.",
      "The Blues had been enamoured with Lavia for a while, bidding £50m on deadline day of the summer 2022 window, just five games into the Belgian’s Southampton career.",
      "Hell, Lavia’s whole career consisted of just seven matches by that point, so prodigious was his excellence in the Manchester City youth set-up.",
      "Premier League relegation did little to dim that light as Lavia was the silver lining to that miserable Saints cloud. And while Liverpool sniffed around, Arsenal and Manchester United were linked and Manchester City held first dibs, Chelsea were not to be deterred.",
      "Injuries continue to blight Lavia’s development but he has shown plenty in short bursts."

      "Viktor Gyokeres is now ‘very keen’ on a move to Manchester United and a transfer expert has revealed what the Red Devils need to do in order to get the deal done for the Sporting star.",
      "After a dismal season saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and miss out on European football after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham, United are working quickly to secure signings to bolster Amorim’s squad ahead of his first full campaign in charge.",
      "Matheus Cunha has joined after United triggered his £62.5m release clause and a new bid is expected to be made for Bryan Mbeumo – who ‘wants to join’ the Red Devils – after Brentford rejected their initial £45m offer with £10m in add-ons.",
      "Brentford are asking for £60m for Mbeumo, while reports claim United are ‘prepared to meet Mbeumo’s whopping wage demands’ which stand at £250,000 a week, equating to £13m a year.",
      "The pair will likely play in the two inverted No.10 roles in Amorim’s 3-4-3 system, but United are also desperately looking for a new striker, with Rasmus Hojlund failing to meet the mark for them in his two seasons at the club.",
      "They were keen on Ipswich’s Liam Delap, but he’s opted to join Chelsea, but that move could open the door to Nicolas Jackson’s exit from Stamford Bridge, with United supposedly ‘interested’ in the Senegal international along with several other suitors.",
      "But according to a report on Wednesday, Amorim remains convinced that Gyokeres – who shone under the Portuguese boss in their time at Sporting together – is the man to lead the Red Devils’ line.",
      "The report claimed ‘Amorim has made it clear to the Old Trafford hierarchy that he is desperate to seal a reunion with the Sporting star’ having been ‘not happy to see Delap pinpointed as Manchester United’s leading target’, with Gyokeres the striker he’s wanted all along.",
      "‘Amorim is poised to win the battle to convince the hierarchy to recruit a proven goalscorer’, though United must sell at least one high-profile star in order to raise funds for the £59m star.",
      "‘Gyokeres’ knowledge of Amorim’s demands is being seen as a major advantage’ by the Red Devils hierarchy.",
      "And now transfer expert Ben Jacobs has revealed that Gyokeres is ‘very keen’ on a move to Old Trafford and explained how they can get the deal done for the 27-year-old.",
      "Jacobs told The United Stand: “My understanding is that Viktor Gyokeres would be very keen on a move to Man United if they could pull that off, financially speaking.",
      "“I don’t think Gyokeres would be on £300,000 a week or more. So if Rashford and Sancho go they’ve got wage bill space to invest in these players, so that’s why if they bite the bullet on the transfer and agent fees, if they structure it in a way where they can start in the next financial year and get it on flexible instalments, it can be a way they can do that deal.”",
      "Arsenal have chosen to focus on their attempts to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko after Viktor Gyokeres ‘says yes’ to Man Utd, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are closing in on the signings of Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez and Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd have ‘made contact’ with Sporting over a move for Viktor Gyokeres as Ruben Amorim is ‘poised to win the battle’ for the £59m striker.",
      "Arsenal could now miss out on the signing of Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres after Atletico Madrid’s late attempt to win the race, according to reports.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…",
      "According to reports, Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko ‘could cost £93million’ as Arsenal weigh up a move for him or Sporting’s Viktor Gyokeres."

      "Former Manchester United man Paul Parker has hailed a Red Devils target as a “dream signing” but feels he’s currently at the “best club in the world to play for.”",
      "United are moving quickly this summer to ensure they are more competitive than their 15th-placed Premier League finish this season. Indeed, they have already landed Wolves forward Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal.",
      "They have also been given confidence over getting Bryan Mbeumo through the door. It was recently stated by transfer insider David Ornstein that the Brentford forward wants to join United, with the club to open talks.",
      "United have done so, and their opening bid is said to have been worth £55million, which is ‘some way below’ the Bees’ asking price.",
      "In any case, it’s felt Mbeumo would be perfect for United, per former Red Devil Parker.",
      "He told aceodds.com: “Mbeumo has been absolutely unbelievable. He’s had a completely absurd season, and he has only improved since Ivan Toney left the club. What he’s done for Brentford is incredible.",
      "“He owes a lot to Thomas Frank. This is yet another example of why Frank is one of the best managers in the world, because he gets the best out of his players. He’s outstanding.",
      "“He would be a brilliant signing for United. A magical signing, because he would be a massive step up from the other players. He would be a dream signing. But does he actually want to leave Brentford? Honestly, I’m not sure.",
      "“It’s a fantastic club and if you take away things like money and status, Brentford might just be the best club to play for in the world.”",
      "Though Brentford finished far above United in the Premier League this season – 10th compared to 15th – reports from trusted sources state Mbeumo does indeed want to go to Old Trafford",
      "The wages on offer there would surely be more than at Brentford. Indeed, the Red Devils are said to be prepared to meet Mbeumo’s wage demands of £250,000 per week.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are reportedly the only players who currently earn more than that at United. But Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals this season, which is a better tally than any United player achieved.",
      "Man Utd have submitted an ‘improved offer’ to sign Cameroon international Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford this summer, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘set’ to submit an ‘improved second bid’ as they look to sign Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "A former Manchester United man has told a current Red Devil he should find a new club, as he has “no standout qualities” and “nobody knows what he’s actually good ...",
      "Man Utd’s £55m bid for Mbeumo is ‘some way below’ Brentford’s asking price, but the Red Devils have been handed a ‘major boost’ in their bid to sign him.",

      "They also lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, who finished below them in the league. On the way to the final, Mason Mount finally showed some worth to United.",

      "Parker told aceodds.com: “I’ve said it before, but I just can’t ever see him having a key role at Manchester United. He has no standout qualities and now we’re really seeing why Chelsea were happy to let him go.",
      "“He’s played a bit because other players have been rested and yes, he’s scored, but I haven’t seen anything more from him. He’s clearly one of those players who would benefit from finding a new club.",
      "“I think he needs to figure out who he is as a footballer. What is his identity? He has no identity. Nobody knows what he’s actually good at and I don’t even think he knows himself.",
      "“He looks like a lost boy out there, so first and foremost he needs to find his identity. Otherwise, he won’t succeed at a new club either.”",
      "Parker clearly feels strongly about Mount being moved on, as he recently said: “Rasmus Hojlund has to leave Manchester United for the sake of his own career. He needs a change of environment. Old Trafford chiefs will have to think about moving on Mason Mount too, he’s not athletic enough.”",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha and are in talks with Bryan Mbeumo, both of whom operate in similar areas to Mount, so there’s a chance his opportunities drop in the coming season, whether or not he is able to stay fit.",

      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Man Utd secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd overpaid for most of their squad, and more than a few have depreciated in value since arriving at Old Trafford. Here’s the full breakdown…",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"

      "The 20-year-old winger was a target in January and has remained high on a list of eight or nine attacking names Chelsea are working on this summer.",
      "Gittens is valued at £50m but lost his place in Dortmund's starting XI towards the end of the season.",

      "Man Utd are expecting offers for Sancho this summer.",
      "It is understood a number of clubs in the Premier League and in Europe have approached Sancho's representatives to understand the conditions of a deal.",

      "However, given Sancho's huge wages at United, another loan cannot be ruled out."

      "Man Utd have confirmed a deal to sign Wolves' Matheus Cunha and are expected to open talks with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo with the player keen to move to Old Trafford; Gary Neville shared his thoughts on players Man Utd should focus on offloading this summer",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 08:02, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered a four-player shortlist of players Manchester United must let go this summer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first summer transfer window as United boss is a crucial one as he tries to assemble a squad capable of bouncing back from an all-time Premier League low finish of 15th place.",
      "United also finished the campaign trophyless, having suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, denying the club a return to the Champions League.",
      "However, Neville believes there will be an emphasis on outgoings with an inevitability surrounding some members of the squad. The former United captain believes Marcus Rashford is among the players who must leave this window.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has to leave Manchester United. That ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club,\" said Neville on The Overlap show, It's Called Soccer.",
      "\"I would worry that Villa haven't announced they're keeping him already, because that would be an easy deal to do with United if they were planning on keeping him.",
      "\"It sounds to me that Villa aren't going to keep him and he's going to end up back at United, but I hope for the club and Marcus' sake, it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "\"With Jadon Sancho, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him,\" Neville said.",
      "\"From Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville also namedropped Alejandro Garnacho and Antony as two names who should also be shown the door after both players have recently publicly expressed that their respective futures at Old Trafford are uncertain. Last month, Antony said he is \"smiling and happy\" since joining Real Betis on loan.",
      "On Antony, Neville said: \"His interview was absolutely spot on. I would imagine he was absolutely going under while at United. He's gone to Spain and is absolutely suited down to the ground with Spanish football.",
      "\"Over there, there is a different tactical awareness, technical ability, which is better suited to him. There were players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan; it just didn't quite happen for them, but they had very good careers, by the way. Forlan was sensational in Spain, there are players who aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"Antony is perfect for Spain, and United should facilitate him leaving. Best for United, best for the club.\"",
      "After United's defeat to Spurs, Garnacho spoke to the media after the game to express his discontent at not starting the game. \"We'll see what happens,\" said Garnacho regarding his future after a scathing review of his side's performances.",
      "\"If players are taking on the manager, and if players are questioning the manager in public, through social media, the manager has to win, or the manager has to leave,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before, so I think Garnacho will leave just purely because of that.",
      "\"They've had enough. Garnacho can do it in the Premier League, but I think he'll thrive in Spain, he'll score goals and he'll be someone we'll be looking back at next season and asking: 'Why did Manchester United not keep him?'",
      "\"That type of thing will happen with him, but he'll have to go. That's not me throwing my toys out the pram, saying he has to go, but for the club and for him it's right that he goes.\"",
      "However, Neville took a different view in regards Kobbie Mainoo, with the 20-year-old's future reportedly also in doubt.",
      "\"Mainoo is a step too far,\" Neville said.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield, a top club will want him. Why can't we make him a top player, if he's one of ours and is showing talent? I don't know what's going on there in the last few months, he's had some injuries that have caused him problems, so he needs to stay fit. But I'd like to feel he could be one of the two in midfield that United play.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro or [Manuel] Ugarte, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two. We should be building around Mainoo in that midfield, not because he's come through the ranks. I'm alright for getting rid of players coming through the ranks, but not getting rid of players who come through the ranks and have shown what they can do.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford has been at the club a long time, Garnacho has had two or three years and there's a bit of a situation going on as well. But Mainoo is a no for me. He doesn't leave.\"",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year."
