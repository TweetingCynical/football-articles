      "Ruben Amorim has jumped to the defence of Altay Bayindir after Rio Ferdinand was among those to criticise the Manchester United goalkeeper.",
      "Bayindir has started both of United’s Premier League matches this season, with Andre Onana on the bench at Craven Cottage on Sunday. Having struggled on set pieces in the 1-0 defeat against Arsenal, similar problems occurred in the 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "The Turkey international appeared uncomfortable when defending corners, with Fulham appearing to target the weakness he showed in conceding to Riccardo Calafiori the week before. And while United weren’t punished on set pieces this time, Ferdinand and Gary Neville were among those to highlight Bayindir’s struggles.",
      "But speaking ahead of United’s Carabao Cup match against Grimsby on Wednesday, Amorim rejected the focus on Bayindir. “I know you are focused a lot on the opponents’ corners but if you remember this game, we had our chances and scored a goal from a set piece,” he said.",
      "“We had a penalty. We had at least one in the end near the post. Tell me one game in the Premier League that you didn’t see a big occasion from a corner? That will happen in every game.”",
      "His words come amid yet another debate over the goalkeeping position at United. Onana was the first choice last season, but sat on the bench on Sunday watching Bayindir, having recovered from an injury over the summer.",
      "United are in talks with Royal Antwerp over the signing of goalkeeper Senne Lammens, which suggests Amorim is unhappy with his current crop, which also includes 39-year-old Tom Heaton. Former United defender Ferdinand has urged Amorim to put on some specific training sessions to help Bayindir adapt.",
      "“We look shaky. The goalkeeper doesn’t fill me with massive confidence,” he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel. “He needs to liven up. I know that, definitely. I’ll tell you what I’d do, I’d be getting him out on the pitch every day and smashing balls under the crossbar.",
      "“He’s got to get used to it, he’s got to get used to contact and work out a way. Make sure the referee is aware by the way that there’s going to be contact. Shout, get him aware to look at you so if there’s any contact, like in the Fulham game, that you get the free-kick.",
      "“I don’t think he talks enough, he doesn’t make people aware of what’s going on and then his decision-making in those moments hasn’t been good enough.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes once predicted that Kobbie Mainoo would struggle to maintain his strong form at the club, as sad footage of the young midfielder looking dejected emerges. Mainoo, 20, was viewed as the future of the Red Devils due to his performances over the last two seasons.",
      "Mainoo racked up an impressive collection of wonder goals and earned his England debut just over a year ago. He also claimed the man of the match performance in United's FA Cup final victory over Manchester City in 2024 after scoring the winner.",
      "Yet he's gone from having the world at his feet to now experiencing real uncertainty surrounding his United future. Under Ruben Amorim, Mainoo has started just 15 out of 44 games, and he was left on the bench for the second successive match this season as United drew 1-1 with Fulham on Sunday.",
      "A social media video of Mainoo at the full-time whistle has gone viral, as it showed the youngster looking despondent, with rumours of his potential departure continuing to grow ahead of Monday's deadline.",
      "Speaking back in April 2024, United skipper Fernandes had the foresight to see that Mainoo would not always have it his own way, as opponents began to figure out his game following his stunning breakthrough campaign.",
      "\"It might not come this season, but it may come next season that it gets a little bit tougher for Kobbie because people know your game,\" Fernandes said. \"They know how to stop you and they’ve got different plans for you and ultimately different ways to go about nullifying your effect on the game.\"",
      "Speaking about the impact Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho – who is set to be on his way out of United with a switch to Chelsea still on the cards – had made upon their arrival in the first team, Fernandes was effusive in his praise, however.",
      "\"They've been playing most and they've been doing well,\" Fernandes said. \"They've been doing great things. I think they've been really good; they've been improving themselves. It's just the first steps. They need to keep going.\"",
      "Yet the midfielder's troubling prophecy looks to have materialised into an unfortunate reality for Mainoo.",
      "Amorim opted for a midfield pairing of Casemiro and Fernandes to start the game against Fulham, with Mason Mount dropping back when the former was taken off for forward Benjamin Sesko. Manuel Ugarte was later brought on for Mount.",
      "Footage after the game showed Mainoo aimlessly strolling around and crouching down, before briefly applauding United's travelling fans. He ultimately cut a figure of a player who's future seems destined to lie elsewhere.",
      "Reports state that Mainoo would consider leaving United in the final week of the summer transfer window if a suitable offer was tabled. Chelsea were also reportedly interested in the young star back in January.",
      "Discussions over a new contract are at an impasse too, with Amorim claiming there had been \"no news\" regarding a new deal for Mainoo ahead of the Fulham game.",
      "In a twist of fate, Amorim revealed post-match that the 20-year-old is actually in competition with the man who had sounded the warning to Mainoo for a place in the starting line-up.",
      "\"Mainoo is fighting for his position with Bruno,\" Amorim said. \"I changed two midfielders. I left Mason Mount there because we wanted to score a goal and when I changed, I felt the team needed one holding midfielder.",
      "\"So he needs to fight for his position with Bruno. At the moment, he is fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has assured Kobbie Mainoo that there'll be 'a lot of games' if he elects to stay at Manchester United. Mainoo, 20, has been rooted to the bench so far this season, failing to feature in either of the Red Devils' first two games.",
      "The midfielder was an unused substitute as United began the new campaign with a 1-0 loss against Arsenal before Amorim once again left him on the bench during Sunday's 1-1 draw away to Fulham. Team-mates Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have been preferred in midfield, with Manuel Ugarte and Mason Mount also used.",
      "Mainoo's future has been plunged into uncertainty as a result of his absence, with it now emerging that the 20-year-old is willing to leave Old Trafford before the summer transfer window closes next Monday. The Red Devils also aren't ruling out his sale after failing to agree a new contract with Mainoo's representatives in recent months.",
      "The 10-time England international has two years left on his current deal at Old Trafford which he signed shortly after breaking into United's first-team squad in February 2023. Amorim's reluctance to use Mainoo, however, has thrust his immediate future into the spotlight.",
      "Mainoo could finally be handed a start when United begin their Carabao Cup campaign away to Grimsby Town on Wednesday. Ahead of the second-round tie, Amorim insisted that players must 'fight for the places' in his team but reiterated that opportunities 'for everybody' will come.",
      "\"They just need to fight for the places, and then everything can change,\" the Red Devils boss, who held his pre-Grimsby news conference after the Fulham game, said.",
      "\"Sometimes one is playing, in other moments, other guys are going to play, and we have the cups, so we're going to have a lot of games for everybody.\"",
      "It'd certainly raise more questions if Mainoo doesn't feature against League Two opposition. As the Red Devils return to Premier League action on Saturday at home to Burnley in their final game before the international break, Amorim is expected to name a much-changed XI for the trip to Grimsby.",
      "\"We have three games this week, we have quality players, and we need to do rotation to try to win every game,\" the United manager added. \"All the players are available. Then we will make the choice to get the best starting XI to win every game.\"",
      "Mainoo will be hoping to seize any opportunity and make a late push to be included in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for two World Cup qualifiers. The Three Lions face Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday, September 6 before making the journey to Serbia three days later.",

      "Roy Keane has admitted he plans to steer clear of two supporters on his next visit to Cork City after being proven wrong. The Manchester United icon attended the League of Ireland clash between Cork and Sligo Rovers last month.",
      "Keane witnessed Cork establish a 2-0 advantage before three second half goals resulted in a dramatic collapse for the hosts. Their fate was sealed by an 89th-minute winner from Sligo's Ryan O'Kane. However, it was a concerning incident during the first half that sparked Keane's disagreement with fans.",
      "Cork's teenage talent Cathal O'Sullivan was taken off with an early injury, but legendary midfielder Keane cautioned supporters against making their own diagnosis.",
      "\"You know medical staff who watch football hate when pundits start talking about an injury of a player,\" Keane said in a behind-the-scenes video on The Overlap.",
      "\"You know, you make a judgment, 'Oh, it looks bad.' But we're not medically qualified. We haven't treated the injury and we don't know what we're talking about.",
      "\"I was at a Cork City game a few weeks ago, a young City lad got injured. He went down after about 20 minutes, it looked strange.",
      "\"So I went in at half-time for a cup of tea. These lads I know, Cork City, and they were like, 'I think it's his cruciate.' And I went, 'Hold on a second lads, the two of you.'",
      "\"I kind of know them and I said, 'You don't know what you're talking about. You've already give him a cruciate. Have you treated it?' They went, 'Oh, no.' Are you qualified the two of you? 'No, no.'",
      "\"A couple days later, he's done his cruciate. I have to go back to Cork City, these two lads will be there. I'll have to avoid them!\"",
      "The Irish Mirror reported that O'Sullivan, 18, had been on the radar of several clubs, including Brentford, Crystal Palace and Celtic. However, he is set to be sidelined for several months after sustaining an ACL injury.",
      "After their defeat to Sligo, Cork bounced back with a victory over Galway United and secured a draw against Derry City. Gerard Nash's team have also advanced in the FAI Cup following their triumph over Waterford, though they did suffer a 3-0 setback against Bohemians last Friday.",
      "Keane never turned out for his hometown club during his playing days. He came through the youth system at Rockmount and featured for Cobh Ramblers before making the move to Nottingham Forest in 1990.",
      "The 54-year-old did recently look back on his formative years during the Stick to Football podcast after sharing a photograph of his family from his early time at Manchester United.",
      "\"You're on about photos, look at that there,\" Keane said about a picture of him with his parents, becoming visibly emotional. \"You're on about family, the ups and downs of football. But when you see your family at Wembley after you've won a big game...\"",

      "After several controversial decisions during the Premier League’s opening weekend, all eyes were on VAR ahead of this weekend’s action. Eberechi Eze’s free-kick goal being ruled out against Chelsea and James Tarkowski’s so-called handball in particular had caused a stir, sparking early fears that refereeing calls would dominate headlines again this season.",
      "Matchday two was slightly less controversial in terms of big refereeing decisions for PGMOL. The Video Assistant Referee, for the majority, supported the matchday official’s on-pitch decisions – though there were clear examples of inconsistency once again.",
      "One incident in particular caused a stir during Newcastle’s 3-2 defeat to Liverpool on Monday, where Simon Hooper initially showed Anthony Gordon a yellow card for a reckless challenge on Virgil van Dijk. After being told to check the incident on the monitor, however, Hooper decided to brandish a red card.",
      "During the 33rd minute of Manchester United’s visit to Fulham, a corner saw several players go down in the box at the same time. Referee Chris Kavanagh initially allowed play to continue but VAR soon began checks for a potential penalty over a foul by Calvin Bassey on Mason Mount.",
      "After one minute and 45 seconds, Kavanagh was sent to the monitor by VAR, Darren England, where Bassey was adjudged to have thrown Mount to the ground. A spot-kick was awarded, which Bruno Fernandes missed.",
      "And despite Ruben Amorim’s criticisms of the corner decision that went against his side last weekend, the Red Devils this time benefitted from the PGMOL’s decision to clampdown on unfair grappling inside the box this season.",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb said before the start of the season: \"What we've said to the officials is, if you get one of those extreme situations where one player is clearly dragging another one to the floor in an extreme non-footballing action, even if it's off the ball, we expect either the referee to see it or, if it's a clear one, then the VAR will will intervene and recommend the referee looks at it at the screen because it fits the criteria that we've laid out.\"",
      "In the 58th minute of the same fixture, another corner saw Leny Yoro head the ball into the net off Rodrigo Muniz. But Yoro appeared to push Bassey with both arms as the ball came into the box, which prevented the latter from being able to challenge for the ball.",
      "Despite VAR looking at the incident, it claimed that the level of contract wasn’t impactful enough to warrant overturning the referee’s original decision, meaning the goal stood. It demonstrated some of the major inconsistencies with VAR within the same game.",
      "Arsenal’s fourth goal against Leeds United was briefly checked by VAR for a possible handball by William Saliba in the build-up to Jurrien Timber’s brace.",
      "VAR stuck with the on-pitch decision and the goal stood as accidental handball is only an automatic offence if it is by the goal-scorer – in this case Timber rather than Saliba. Saliba’s act had to either be deliberate or his arm needed to be in an unnatural position for the goal to be ruled out.",
      "In the dying seconds of the game, 15-year-old sensation Max Dowman’s nimble footwork inside the box saw him brought down by Leeds’ Anton Stach, with the referee immediately pointing to the spot.",
      "Replays showed that Stach had caught the winger’s trailing foot and, despite contact being minimal, VAR backed the referee's original decision, with Viktor Gyokeres firing in the penalty to score his second of the game.",
      "Brentford had a second goal chalked off during their 1-0 win over Aston Villa on Saturday. Mikkel Damsgaard fired in a loose ball after a long throw but referee Tony Harrington disallowed it for a foul by Nathan Collins on goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez beforehand.",
      "VAR official Tim Wood checked the call but did not intervene, sticking with the on-field no-goal ruling, believing Martinez had been impeded. The determining factor seemed to be that Collins had moved towards Martinez but the call was soft, especially when considering what Saliba got away with against United on matchday one.",
      "Late in the first half of Liverpool’s dramatic win away at Newcastle, winger Gordon flew into Van Dijk from behind as the centre-back was playing a pass. Referee Simon Hooper initially showed Gordon a yellow card, but he was instructed by VAR to take another look at the challenge on the pitchside monitor.",
      "Hooper ultimately decided to overturn his decision, showing Gordon a straight red for \"serious foul play\", after his tackle was deemed high. \"After VAR review, the referee overturned his on-field decision of a yellow card to Anthony Gordon,\" the Premier League Match Centre explained on social media.",
      "They then quoted Hooper's explanation, which read: \"After review, the Newcastle United number 10 commits a serious foul play challenge. The challenge is with speed and makes clear contact on the Liverpool number 4's calf. My final decision is red card to Newcastle United number 10.\"",
      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer agreed with Hooper's decision, writing on social media: \"What a stupid challenge man. It's a red card all day.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has admitted Manchester United would not have been competitive in the Champions League this season. Amorim endured a painful first seven months at Old Trafford, but a Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur provided a route into Europe’s elite competition.",
      "But United were beaten 1-0 in a lacklustre final in Bilbao. They now go to League Two Grimsby on Wednesday in the second round of the Carabao Cup with Amorim saying his side are only capable of competing on domestic fronts this season.",
      "“We were not prepared to play in Europe. That was my feeling,” said Amorim. “(We were not prepared) to play strong games in the Champions League and then play in the Premier League. “I said that last season. We need time to prepare every game.",
      "\"The games are really, really competitive and we need time to build the base, and then, in the future, to move forward. We will reach one moment where we will need to reach Europe for everybody to have more games.”",
      "Despite investing £200million into signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, no United player has scored this season. After losing 1-0 to Arsenal in their opening match of the Premier League season, their goal in the 1-1 draw with Fulham was an own goal. Leny Yoro’s off-target header hit Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz on its way into the net, moments after Bruno Fernandes skied a penalty kick.",
      "Amorim may be relieved his side are not playing European and Premier League football at the same time but it will certainly trouble his fringe players. He is inflexible with his 3-4-3 formation, which has left the likes of Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee on the outside.",
      "The two United stars, as well as youngsters Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi, may expect to feature or even start at Blundell Park. When asked if he will make changes against the Mariners, Amorim said: “We have two games this week. We have quality players and we need rotation to try and win every game.",
      "“We need time to develop as a team. So they need to just fight for their places and then everything can change. Sometimes one is playing and then in other moments other guys are going to play, and then we have the cups. There are going to be a lot of games for everybody.”",
      "A small positive for the Reds is Noussair Mazraoui being close to a return. The Moroccan has been out with a thigh injury and has not featured since playing 45 minutes in United’s 1-1 pre-season draw with Leeds.",
      "Amorim said: “Maybe he is going to return next week, we will see. But he is near. We are just finishing some drills with him to make sure he is not going to have another problem.”",

      "This weekend, you probably felt old. On Saturday, a 15-year-old made his debut for Arsenal and on Monday, a 16-year-old scored the winning goal for Liverpool.",
      "Arsenal's Max Dowman - born on New Year's Eve in 2009 - dazzled in the Gunners' 5-0 victory over Leeds after coming on as a second-half substitute. Dowman won a penalty in front of the Emirates' North Bank, instantly endearing himself to the supporters who've heard so much about him in recent months.",
      "Then it was Rio Ngumoha's turn to steal the headlines. Brought on for his debut as Liverpool chased a winner in the dying embers of their clash with Newcastle, Ngumoha rifled home in the 100th minute at St James' Park to earn the Reds three precious points.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha's history-making performances brought back memories of teenagers from yesteryear who also burst onto the scene. From THAT Wayne Rooney goal against Arsenal in 2002 to Robbie Fowler's four-minute and 33-second hat-trick eight years prior, there've been some incredible feats from youngsters down the years.",
      "It is still impossible to look past Wayne Rooney and his goal against Arsenal way back in October 2002. Rooney was five days short of his 17th birthday, it was an incredible strike and it ended Arsenal’s unbeaten run when they were such a dominant force.",
      "It got everyone talking about this generational talent, England's boy wonder and produced that iconic piece of commentary from Clive Tyldesley. \"Remember the name - Wayne Rooney!\"",
      "Well, didn't we just. Rooney went on to have an incredible career for club and country and I just lived hearing him talk this week after Max Dowman made his debut for Arsenal aged 15 years and 234 days.",
      "Rooney revealed he went back after games to play with his mates on the street, kicking a ball against the garages and just being one of the lads. I think Dowman, like Rooney, will be a generational talent. But he's not even Arsenal's youngest debutant. That feat belongs to Ethan Nwaneri.",
      "As for Rio Ngumoha, he is an incredible prospect. His finish was amazing against Newcastle. But to really make the impact, you have to have the career. And Rooney did.",
      "What's the best moment from a teenager in Premier League history? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "Everyone else will pick Wayne Rooney's goal against Arsenal for Everton that was the start of his rise to becoming one of England's greatest goalscorers, but one I always remember is James Milner's second goal in three days as a 16-year-old sub against Chelsea.",
      "Milner, in a shirt so big it looked like they could fit two of him in it, took the ball at the edge of the area and cut back before firing it into the corner in December 2002.",
      "He had become the league's youngest scorer just two days earlier but showed it would be no flash in the pan with a fine second. Milner is still playing now and his career has been such a huge success in three different decades.",
      "To a younger fan, he's now just that bloke off the telly that hates watching films and has the 'bravery' to throw apple cores into the bin. But teenage Michael Owen was genuinely one of the most exciting players I have ever seen.",
      "At 18, he was joint top scorer in the Premier League, scoring 18 times in his first full season as a starter in '97-98. At the end of that season he was fourth in the Ballon d'Or rankings and recognised as one of the best players in the world.",
      "His pace was electrifying and his finishing deadly. And we don't even need to mention THAT goal against Argentina in the World Cup (I do, I always do).",
      "In April 1993, Sheffield Wednesday took on a Southampton side at Hillsborough in the Premier League, though their attentions were firmly elsewhere. They were six days away from playing Arsenal in the League Cup final, a competition they had won two years previous, still to this day the last side from outside of the top flight to win a major honour.",
      "Boss Trevor Francis rung the changes, including numerous young stars, one of whom was Chris Bart-Williams. The then 18-year-old had already begun to make his name but showed his talents with a stunning hat-trick as the Owls dispatched of the Saints 5-2. Only Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler have scored Premier League trebles at a younger age.",
      "Wednesday would lose the Wembley showpiece 2-1, and would also go on to taste defeat in the FA Cup final after a replay to the same opponents, with Bart-Williams coming off the bench in both games.",
      "The Bartman, as he was affectionately known, would also go on to play for Nottingham Forest and Charlton in the top flight. He tragically died in 2023, aged just 49, on the same day as his ex-boss Francis.",
      "Rio Ngumoha has gone in at No.4 on the list of the youngest ever Premier League goalscorers after his St James' Park rescue act, and at No.12 is the player he most reminds me of.",
      "Raheem Sterling was 17 years and 317 days old when he scored his first top-flight goal in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Reading in October 2012, and that set the tone for two years in which the teenager would emerge onto the national and international stage.",
      "Liverpool's 2013-14 title tilt is now remembered for Luis Suarez's genius and Steven Gerrard's slip, but in the second half of the season it was powered by the energy, invention and intelligence of Sterling.",
      "He scored a brace in the 5-1 thrashing of Arsenal, a clever strike as Manchester City were beaten 3-2 and two more goals at Norwich - the game Gerrard had told his team to 'go again' for as the title came within agonising reach.",
      "The latter years of Sterling's career may well be petering out, but if Ngumoha can produce a body of work akin to the four-time Premier League winner he'll have done very well indeed.",
      "To this day, it still feels like the most miraculous goal I've seen with my own eyes. In April 2009, Aston Villa looked to have staged a memorable comeback at Old Trafford to dent Manchester United's hopes of winning a third successive title and boost their own hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Martin O'Neill's side were excellent throughout but just after Gabriel Agbonlahor had given them the lead on the hour mark, I saw a the figure of a 6ft 17-year-old emerge from the home bench as Sir Alex Ferguson's behest: Federico Macheda. He was so unknown to eight-year-old me that I can't even remember if he was listed on the matchday programme (I'm sure it's somewhere in my attic).",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo levelled the game with his second goal of the afternoon on 81 minutes and set us up for a blockbuster finish. Three minutes into stoppage time, United were probing for a goal to send them back up to first place above Liverpool.",
      "Captain Gary Neville bounded forward before Ryan Giggs fired the ball into Macheda. As Old Trafford held its breath, the Italian striker superbly turned Luke Young with one skilful touch and unleashed a shot which gave the sprawling Brad Friedel no chance in front of the Stretford End.",
      "Bedlam. The loudest noise I'd ever heard. United were top again and it felt like the moment that the title was won - even though Macheda had to do it once more at Sunderland the following weekend.",
      "His United career never came to anything and he's now playing in Greece, having failed to live up to his potential. But he achieved something which millions can only dream of, all by the age of 17.",
      "For me, it has to be Dele Alli's stunning touch, swivel and volleyed goal against Crystal Palace back in the 2015-16 season, when he was just 19 years of age playing for Tottenham. It has to go down as one of the greatest goals in Premier League history and the fact he did it at such a tender age underlined his incredible ability and potential.",
      "This was a goal that really put him on the map. It was no fluke, either, and clearly something Alli had been working on in training - displaying how he oozed confidence and had an eye for the spectacular.",
      "After that, the world was his oyster. He had Sir Alex Ferguson drooling over him and soon became a key man for England, too. That was his first season in the Premier League and he finished the campaign with 10 strikes.",
      "The following season he'd go on to net another 22, and there were more incredible goals in the years to come. It makes it all the more heartbreaking that his once-promising career has fizzled out.",
      "When West Ham effectively gave up on their European hopes by fielding a reserve side away to Astra Giurgiu in 2015, it was a big risk. Just three days later, though, one of the academy stars who didn’t travel to Romania showed just why manager Slaven Bilic was right to prioritise the league opener at Arsenal.",
      "Reece Oxford was 16 years and 237 days old when he started at the Emirates Stadium - a few months younger than Rio Ngumoha is today. Only 11 players have got Premier League minutes at a younger age, and even fewer have done so from the start of a match.",
      "Ten of those 11 are attacking players, but Oxford had the much more high-pressure task of anchoring the Hammers midfield and keeping a prime Mesut Ozil quiet. He was arguably the best player on the pitch as Bilic's team won 2-0, and they only beat Arsenal one more time - home or away - in the next eight years.",
      "I'm split between two here - and funnily enough they came in almost identical circumstances. They came for the same team, in the same stadium, in the same goal and both triggered an iconic moment of commentary from the legendary Martin Tyler.",
      "Let's start with the most recent. After a much-anticipated £58million move from French side Monaco, then 19-year-old forward Anthony Martial was named on the bench for Manchester United against Liverpool.",
      "He was eventually called upon in the second half and scored a sensational solo goal to secure victory against their bitter rivals. It would be tough to suggest that there have been any more satisfying starts to a career as a Red Devil.",
      "But I think Federico Macheda's contributions at the back-end of the 2008-09 season deserve to just about pip Martial's debut strike. The Italian, who was just 17 at the time, produced a stunning spin and finish to secure a dramatic comeback victory against Aston Villa. It's simply one of the all-time iconic Premier League moments.",
      "To make things better, he then scored again against Sunderland a week later. And with United beating Liverpool to the title by four points, it's hard to argue against the fact that Macheda's goals got them over the line - and is surely the biggest impact in Premier League history by a teenager.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt is struggling for form with Manchester United because he has “become a little too heavy”, according to the club’s former coach Rene Meulensteen. De Ligt has started both of United’s Premier League games this season and his form has concerned Meulensteen.",
      "The Dutchman is currently Ruben Amorim’s preferred player to start in the middle of United’s back three, with Leny Yoro and Luke Shaw on either side. Amorim has left Harry Maguire out of the starting line-up for the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal and the 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "De Ligt joined United from Bayern Munich in a deal worth £38.6million last summer and has made 44 appearances for the club so far. The 26-year-old played at the highest level for Ajax, Juventus and Bayern before arriving at Old Trafford, but Meulensteen, who was Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant for six years at United, has spotted something that may be holding him back.",
      "“Matthijs de Ligt's form is a concern because consistent performances and leadership are not guaranteed week in, week out,” he told CoinPoker. “He had a significant number of injuries last year and wasn't always a first-choice player for Ruben Amorim.",
      "“When he first emerged at Ajax, he was a strong athlete, but I believe he has become a little too heavy over time, which hasn't always benefited his game, despite his naturally strong build. This will be a critical season for him.",
      "“It will be interesting to see what formation Amorim implements at Manchester United, given the number of centre-back options. They have so many central defenders to choose from. Consistency is key, especially in the backline to create stability. Players need to understand each other's movements and react accordingly.",
      "“Injuries sometimes necessitate chopping and changing, this is definitely a critical season for him. He's only 26, I thought he was older given all the clubs he's played for. You'd expect him to be the next consistent centre-back for the next four years, easily. We'll see what happens.”",
      "United took the lead against Fulham after Yoro’s header from a corner hit Rodrigo Muniz and went in. But they couldn’t hold onto their lead for long as Emile Smith Rowe ghosted into the penalty area to convert past Altay Bayindir 15 minutes later.",
      "De Ligt has a good relationship with Amorim and is convinced that the ex-Sporting Lisbon coach will turn things around at United. “I've experienced many managers and he's one of the most easy to talk to as a player,” he said earlier in the summer.",
      "“He's really into details. Before signing new players, first he's looking at the culture, what needs to change and what can be improved to become a better football club. From next season we will see more of that.",
      "“I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have. Maybe before, you had the best players, but you're not a team.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United star Wayne Rooney claims he would find it \"frustrating\" playing under Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim. Rooney, 39, believes Amorim's penchant for shifting players around the pitch throughout games would ultimately leave him feeling \"fed up\".",
      "United's lacklustre start to the season continued on Sunday as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Fulham at Craven Cottage. Leny Yoro's header, deflecting in off Fulham's Rodrigo Muniz, saw United open the scoring after Bruno Fernandes had skied a penalty over the bar. However, United's goal was later cancelled out by Emile Smith Rowe.",
      "United's forward line endured a difficult and inconsistent afternoon as they were moved from their preferred positions as the game advanced. Mason Mount eventually dropped deep into midfield to make way for new recruit Benjamin Sesko up top.",
      "New signing Matheus Cunha, initially deployed as a striker, found himself later playing in between the lines as Amorim looked eager to find a solution to his misfiring side. Rooney, speaking on The Wayne Rooney Show, believes being moved around the pitch to suit different formations can ultimately have an adverse effect on players.",
      "\"The one thing, players are getting moved around the pitch, shifted into different positions,\" Rooney said. \"You see Mason Mount playing two or three positions. Cunha, [Bryan] Mbeumo, Amad [Diallo] – players are moving into different positions and from that you can't get a settled run in the team of doing the same thing and one thing.",
      "\"I know as a player who did that, it can be very frustrating and all of a sudden you become fed up of it and that shows through body language as well. I just hope that doesn't start to happen with these new players because I think there's a lot of ability in there already early on.\"",
      "While Cunha hit the post, £71million man Mbeumo struggled to impact the game. Another of United's new signings, Sesko, also failed to make his presence felt with the Slovenian not even registering a shot on goal.",
      "After the game, Amorim defended his new trio. “It was a tough match, and when we scored the goal we forgot about maintaining the way we play and tried to maintain the result. We want to win so bad,” Amorim said.",
      "“He (Sesko) needs time. It’s not easy to come off the bench when the game is really fast. He is learning [that] the game is faster than the Bundesliga but he had some good connections with his team-mates.”",
      "However, United's £73m signing from RB Leipzig did face the wrath of another former United star in Gary Neville, after the 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "Neville also echoed Rooney's concerns that Amorim's chopping and changing on the pitch had a negative impact on United. Neville added: “The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team.",
      "\"But I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.”",

      "As Ruben Amorim grapples with his goalkeeping dilemma at Manchester United, he could do worse than heed the wisdom Sir Alex Ferguson shared with Sean Dyche. Today, goalkeepers are expected to start attacks and maintain possession with their feet, while Ferguson solely concentrated on how his No. 1s were able to stop goals going in.",
      "Altay Bayindir once more looked shaky during United's 1-1 away draw with Fulham when dealing with the Cottagers' set-pieces. It mirrored his struggles against Arsenal seven days earlier.",
      "Nevertheless, he showcased his distribution skills when he released Matheus Cunha with a thunderous long ball, with the Brazilian's attempt being expertly thwarted by Cottagers keeper Bernd Leno.",
      "Impressive as this was, Ferguson, during a private chat with Dyche after a previous meeting between Burnley and United, insisted the primary concern for keepers should be preventing goals and dealing with crosses, rather than fancy footwork.",
      "Given Bayindir and Andre Onana have both looked uncertain under Amorim, who is reportedly eyeing a swoop for Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens, the United head coach might be wise to follow Ferguson's counsel when making his next goalkeeping call.",
      "Speaking on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, Dyche revealed details of a discussion he'd had with the legendary United chief regarding his former Burnley keeper Nick Pope, now of Newcastle. Dyche said: \"Different managers want different things. They were questioning Nick Pope, I couldn't believe it.",
      "\"They were questioning him about his playing [with his feet], saying, 'Oh yeah, but he can't do this and he can't do that.' Sir Alex Ferguson always invites you up to his room there. When we (Burnley) played United, Nick Pope was playing terrific. I think we drew the game and he was coming out, taking crosses, terrific.",
      "\"He was the monster player that he is, great player for me, great goalkeeper. Sir Alex, he said, 'Oh he's a big boy and he does this,' and I said, 'Yeah, they keep going on about his feet.'",
      "\"He said, 'Feet? He stops the ball going in the net. People said that about [Edwin] van der Sar. That (ability with his feet) was a bonus. Van der Sar could handle and he could stop the ball going in the net. The rest of it was a bonus.'",
      "\"That's old guard by the way, but call it how it is. I'm not going against modern coaching, trust me, I know all the terminology and that's fine. But sometimes the simplicity is, his job is to stop the ball going into the net.",
      "\"Brian Clough used to say to his centre halves, 'Head it, and kick it, and give it to someone who is better than you – and that's everyone.' The basics are still the basics, that was Sir Alex's point, and Nick Pope stops it going in the goal.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag, Amorim's predecessor at United, didn't heed this advice when he splashed the cash on Onana, a keeper known for his footwork and creativity, to replace David de Gea. However, Onana's shot-stopping and handling skills have been found wanting at Old Trafford.",
      "With United said to be nearing a potential agreement over signing Lammens, it seems neither Bayindir nor Onana feature in Amorim's long-term plans. Given the shortcomings of both keepers, the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss might do well to ensure Lammens can handle the basics, much like Ferguson did with Van der Sar.",

      "Ruben Amorim needs to put on specific extra training sessions for goalkeeper Altay Bayindir or Manchester United’s game plan will continue to be undermined at set pieces. That’s the opinion of Rio Ferdinand, who was concerned by what he saw in their 1-1 draw with Fulham on Sunday.",
      "Amorim opted to continue with Bayindir as his starting goalkeeper at Craven Cottage, with Andre Onana on the substitutes’ bench. Having been at fault for Riccardo Calafiori’s goal in the 1-0 loss against Arsenal on the opening weekend, the Turkey international’s struggles continued.",
      "Bayindir struggled to assert himself from set pieces as Fulham tried to copy Arsenal’s tactics and target him. Although they managed not to concede from a set piece on Sunday, Ferdinand is worried and thinks action needs to be taken on the training pitch.",
      "“We look shaky. The goalkeeper doesn’t fill me with massive confidence,” he said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel. “I’ve got to be honest with you, he made a great save in the game from Joshua King, when he came out with his feet, he did really well there.",
      "“But from set pieces, even outside of the goal, he’s coming for things that are 50-50 and he’s not sure. The whole backline doesn't look good in that area, not just the goalkeeper to be honest with you.”",
      "Ferdinand added: “He needs to liven up. I know that, definitely. I’ll tell you what I’d do, I’d be getting him out on the pitch every day and smashing balls under the crossbar.",
      "“He’s got to get used to it, he’s got to get used to contact and work out a way. Make sure the referee is aware by the way that there’s going to be contact. Shout, get him aware to look at you so if there’s any contact, like in the Fulham game, that you get the free-kick.",
      "“I don’t think he talks enough, he doesn’t make people aware of what’s going on and then his decision-making in those moments hasn’t been good enough.",
      "“I don’t think he’s seen enough of that, Declan Rice whipping balls right under his nose. He’s not on his own by the way in lacking a bit of confidence.”",
      "United are in talks to sign Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens, but it is unclear where the 23-year-old would end up in the pecking order. Onana was United’s No.1 choice last season, but had to overcome an injury in pre-season and lost his place to Bayindir.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been branded 'embarrassing beyond belief' for 'crying' about the referee bumping into him before his missed penalty against Fulham. Fernandes, 30, had a golden opportunity to put Manchester United ahead at Craven Cottage on Sunday after the Red Devils were awarded a penalty for a foul on Mason Mount.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder placed the ball down from 12 yards and as he began walking backwards to his mark, referee Chris Kavanagh got in Fernandes' way and the pair collided. United's captain was visibly frustrated with Kavanagh and went on to sky his penalty over the crossbar, just the seventh time that he's missed a spot-kick in his career.",
      "When the teams came back out for the second half, Fernandes was seen in conversation with the referee and appeared to still be complaining. After United could only manage a 1-1 draw, the 30-year-old stressed that the bump wasn't an 'excuse' for his miss but he was upset that Kavanagh hadn't apologised for getting in his way.",
      "That didn't wash with Craig Burley, though. The ex-Chelsea star, known for his straight-talking style of punditry, fired at Fernandes with both barrels.",
      "\"I want to talk about the captain,\" Burley began on ESPN. \"What a whingy, whiny, little moaning pain in the butt. What an embarrassment, what an embarrassment to a professional footballer.",
      "\"The referee inadvertently nudged him as he was backing off the penalty and he made out the referee has basically run into him. What a big kid.",
      "\"Any player worth his salt would have laughed that off and taken the penalty and yet he whined and moaned and cried, as he does, about something so innocuous. It was embarrassing.",
      "\"A lot of his career at United has been good but there's been a sideshow as well and that encapsulated it for me. I thought it was embarrassing beyond belief.",
      "\"How does that put you off your routine? He made such a song and dance about it that it became the story. I thought it was beyond embarrassing, it was childish, school playground stuff. It beggars belief, it really does.\"",
      "Fernandes gave his side of the story post-match, explaining: \"I was upset. As a penalty taker, you have your own routines, your own things that you do.",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment, but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty. I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too [far] under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",

      "Vardy has been linked to numerous clubs over the summer, including the likes of Everton, Celtic and Rangers. More recently, there has been speculation that he could be heading for the MLS with Inter Miami or Serie A with Napoli, but the 38-year-old is still unattached.",
      "Wrexham, owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, have also been connected with a swoop for the veteran free agent following their promotion to the Championship in April. And United legend Ferdinand is amazed that Vardy, who scored 200 goals in 500 games for the Foxes, hasn't arrived in North Wales following a period of big spending by the Red Dragons.",

However, Ferdinand believes it would be the wrong move for both parties, with Vardy understood to be keen for regular game time and United in need of players who will have a guaranteed impact up front.",
      "Speaking on his Rio Presents YouTube channel, the ex-England international said: \"As much as I love Jamie Vardy and I respect everything he's done in the game, he's not what Man United need right now. He's just gone a bit too far over the hill to really be able to impact the team.",
      "\"You can't bring someone in just to impact the changing room. He isn't going to want to come there and just sit down and just chill. He wants to play football, with the type of person he is. As much as he's got experience, it's just not the right time.",
      "\"I can't believe he's not signed for Wrexham. Right now, I just think it would probably be more harmful for Vardy to come here [to Man Utd] for himself than it would benefit us.\"",
      "Vardy recently spoke out after two of his former Leicester teammates signed for Wrexham this summer with deals agreed for goalkeeper Danny Ward and defender Conor Coady. The pair have so far started in all three of the club's league games as they look to establish themselves in the second tier.",
      "Writing on Instagram after Coady's switch was confirmed, Vardy said: \"All the best brother. What a player and person.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",
      "But does it have a dedicated, quality source of information piped through to your inbox each week, free of ads but packed with informed opinion, analysis and even a little bit of fun each week? That's where Wrexham is the Game steps in...",
      "Available every Wednesday, it provides all the insights you need to be a top red. And for a limited time, a subscription to 'Wrexham is the Game' will cost fans just £15 for the first year.",
      "Sign up for Wrexham is the Game here",
      "As it stands, it would raise eyebrows if Wrexham did make a move for Vardy having already brought in ten new faces so far this summer, including several attackers. Manager Phil Parkinson has signed strikers Kieffer Moore and Ryan Hardie from Sheffield United and Plymouth Argyle respectively.",
      "Forwards Josh Windass and Nathan Broadhead have also joined to bolster Wrexham's frontline. The Red Dragons have so far secured just one point from their opening three Championship fixtures after drawing 2-2 with Sheffield Wednesday at home on Saturday.",
      "Parkinson's side's face another tough challenge in their next league match as they travel to Millwall at the weekend.",

      "Alan Shearer believes Ruben Amorim could find himself under huge pressure if Manchester United stumble against Burnley this weekend. United's campaign has begun inauspiciously - something Amorim can ill-afford to let drag on.",
      "They lost 1-0 to Arsenal on the opening day before dropping points again in a 1-1 draw against Fulham on Sunday. Coming off the back of a miserable 2024/25 season, another slip-up could be devastating for the manager, which is why Shearer views Saturday's 3pm clash as a must-win.",
      "\"They [United] are one of the teams that have to start winning pretty soon, otherwise the pressure will mount, hugely. There's no doubt about it,\" the Newcastle icon said on The Rest is Football podcast.",
      "\"They've got Burnley next. That's one of those games where you probably want it, but if you don't win it then it really does mount the pressure. So they've got to win that one at home, there's no doubt about it.\"",
      "Before they face Burnley, United will visit Grimsby Town on Wednesday in the EFL Cup second round. Normally, that would provide an opportunity to shuffle the line-up and give fringe players some game-time, but anything other than a convincing win over the League Two outfit would pile more pressure onto Amorim's shoulders.",
      "The game might also be used to inject confidence into the club's new attacking trio. Over £200million was spent this summer on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, and Bryan Mbeumo - none of whom have registered a goal or assist yet.",
      "Cunha came closest, rattling the post against Fulham and forcing David Raya into a fine stop against Arsenal. Mbeumo has looked lively too, nearly scoring with an audacious bicycle kick against the Gunners.",
      "The key, however, may be getting Sesko firing. The £74m striker arrived from RB Leipzig earlier this month, and expectations are high. The club is keen to avoid a repeat of Rasmus Hojlund's struggles; after arriving for a comparable sum in 2023, the Dane quickly lost confidence and his form collapsed.",
      "In Premier League history, United have opened a campaign without victory in their first three matches only three times. On two occasions they still managed to go and win the title.",
      "The last instance was in 2014/15 under Louis van Gaal, when defeats and draws to Swansea, Sunderland, and Burnley left them reeling. Amorim, embarking on his first full season in charge, will be desperate to avoid a similar fate.",
      "Recent results against Burnley offer some hope: United are unbeaten in seven, winning five, and have lost to the Clarets just twice since the late 1960s. Still, history will offer little comfort if they don't walk away with all three points this weekend.",
      "The Burnley clash arrives just before the first international break, and United will be anxious to go into it on a high. Anything short of a victory could sour the atmosphere dramatically – perhaps enough to put Amorim's job in real danger.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo could have few options on the table if he does pursue an exit from Old Trafford, according to reports.",
      "Mainoo is one of the most exciting prospects to come out of the club's academy in recent years following his breakthrough under Erik ten Hag in the 2023-24 season.",
      "But he has failed to kick on under his successor Ruben Amorim, who has preferred Casemiro in midfield and has dropped Mainoo for the first two Premier League games of the season.",
      "Fans have questioned why he has fallen out of favour under the Portuguese coach after he opted to bring on Manuel Ugarte off the bench against Arsenal and Fulham, while Mainoo has been an unused substitute for both matches.",
      "There is now speculation that Mainoo could depart Old Trafford in this transfer window after reports that the boyhood United star is open to leaving to pursue more game time with another club.",
      "It's a World Cup year and Mainoo will want to stake a claim for a place in Thomas Tuchel's England squad, having started for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain.",
      "According to the Athletic, Mainoo is considering an exit from United as he approaches the final two years of his contract, but the issue is that there are few options for him in the transfer market.",
      "The summer transfer deadline is approaching on September 1 in less than a week's time but there has been no concrete interest from other clubs or any approaches as of yet.",
      "When asked why Mainoo was out of his plans at present, Amorim said Bruno Fernandes was ahead of him in the pecking order and told the player to \"fight for the position\".",
      "\"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno and I change two midfielders,\" Amorim said after the 1-1 draw at Fulham.",
      "\"I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",

      "Manchester United have three midfielders on their wishlist, but no deals are in the pipeline as the summer transfer window deadline approaches. United have spent over £200million this summer to improve their front line, but problems persist in midfield.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all arrived this summer as Ruben Amorim tries to address their meagre attacking returns. United managed just 44 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and therefore prioritised overhauling their attack.",
      "However, their 1-0 defeat by Arsenal and 1-1 draw against Fulham has shown that Amorim still has an issue in central midfield. He has fielded Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in both games, but the balance has been lacking.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been an unused substitute in both matches and is considering his future ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline. Mason Mount shifted into central midfield at Craven Cottage before Manuel Ugarte took on the holding role from Casemiro.",
      "Amorim does not see Mainoo as No.6 midfielder and says that the academy graduate is instead an alternative for Fernandes. United could therefore be tempted to cash in on Mainoo, who would be helpful from a profit and sustainability perspective, given he is a homegrown player.",
      "He might need to be sold for a new midfielder to be signed, given that the pursuit of Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is the current priority. Amorim is keen to add an athletic and dynamic No.6 to his squad and United have three names on their radar.",
      "The Athletic reports that Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Sporting Lisbon’s Morten Hjulmand are all admired at the club. However, United have given up trying to sign Baleba, due to Brighton’s sky-high £120m valuation, while their interest in Wharton and Hjulmund is also not developed at this stage.",
      "Hjulmand is extremely well known to Amorim, who worked with the Sporting captain during his time with the club, winning two Primeira Liga titles and the Taca de Portugal. The 26-year-old is reportedly available for around £50m, two years after signing from Lecce for just £15m.",
      "Wharton has four years left on his contract with Palace, who are unwilling to sell this summer after losing Eberechi Eze to Arsenal and with Marc Guehi potentially heading to Liverpool. The 21-year-old has caught the eye of scouts from rival Premier League sides and United would face competition if they did move for him.",
      "The focus at United before the window is on offloading their unwanted players, with Alejandro Garnacho in talks over a move to Chelsea, Rasmus Hojlund being eyed by Napoli, RB Leipzig and Atalanta. Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia were all put in the ‘bomb squad’ by Amorim earlier this summer but remain contracted players as the clock ticks down.",

      "Lamine Yamal has been warned to block out all distractions by former wonderkid Freddy Adu. The 18-year-old has shone over recent seasons having made his Barcelona debut during the 2022/23 season.",
      "He has gone on to make 108 appearances for the Catalan giants and enjoyed his best season so far last term with 18 goals to his name. In that time, Yamal has won two La Liga crowns and the Copa del Rey.",
      "The teenager has also earned international recognition having won the Euros with Spain only last summer. But he has been warned that the spotlight could bring some unwanted attention.",
      "Adu - who had a trial at Manchester United as a youngster - has urged Yamal to keep his feet firmly on the ground. Adu, speaking via an online betting site, said: “So obviously all eyes are on him all the time, and that's hard. That's really hard. For me personally, I couldn't just be a regular kid, and this is coming from someone in America and in the States, football isn't even the biggest sport here!",
      "“Yet I was going through that. I can't even imagine how it is for him over there in Spain. It's probably just magnified 1000 times, because that is the national sport.",
      "“He plays for the biggest team, it's the national sport, everywhere he goes, everything he does; all eyes are on him. And that's hard. As a young player, when you're put in a situation like that, it's just very, very difficult to handle.”",
      "Asked how Yamal would be best served adapting to his new-found fame, he replied: “My advice would be for him to just put his head down, train and just focus on his craft. Because there will be a lot of distractions. And I'm sure there is right now.",
      "“I mean, there's been some stuff in the newspapers that I've seen where he was with a woman that was way older than he was or whatever, on vacation and whatnot, and everybody's talking about it. Every little thing he does is going to be talked about.",
      "“If you’re going to go on holiday with an older woman just make sure the only person you go with is your mother! Because at this point, no matter what you it’s going to get talked about, and it's a lot of distractions. So you don't want to make let that become your whole narrative surrounding you as a player. You don't want that. You wanted to be focused on the field.",
      "\"When I was young, I made a lot of mistakes. I was young, and I made mistakes. I hung out with some friends and somebody took a picture of me out at a party or whatever, and it became a big deal. I didn't think it was, but it became a big deal. And then the narrative becomes that you're not focused on your game, that you're just out here hanging out with your friends and party.”",
      "Barcelona have enjoyed a perfect start to the season, with Yamal having already found the net. He will be aiming to extend that form this weekend with a trip to Rayo Vallecano.",

      "Manchester United benefited from two incorrect refereeing decisions in their draw against Fulham on Sunday, according to ex-Premier League referee Mark Halsey.",
      "United drew 1-1 at Craven Cottage in a game dominated by contentious decisions by the officials. The away side should have taken advantage of a penalty call in their favour, but Bruno Fernandes blazed his effort over the crossbar.",
      "Referee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot after VAR sent him to the pitchside monitor to watch an incident from a corner. Fulham defender Calvin Bassey was adjudged to have fouled United midfielder Mason Mount by throwing him to the floor.",
      "Halsey believes that the VAR did not need to send Kavanagh to review the incident because there was a foul by a United player which cancelled things out. He also thinks that United got away with a foul when Leny Yoro’s header went in off Rodrigo Muniz to put them 1-0 up.",
      "“As well as Bassey on Mount, you must also look at Luke Shaw on Fulham’s Rodrigo Muniz as both incidents happened simultaneously,” Halsey wrote for The Sun.",
      "“I do not know why he was called over. Even when Kavanagh went over to the screen, he was there for quite some time looking at it. There are two incidents, so which one is the more serious? The referee should have just played on. They cancel each other out.",
      "“You can understand why Marco Silva has gone ballistic because for United’s goal, you can see a clear push from Leny Yoro on Bassey. So why is that not disallowed?”",
      "Gary Lineker made a similar point when discussing the decision and how it is communicated to fans on the Rest is Football podcast. He said: \"They got a penalty, which my goodness, what a bizarre experience. You know, going to the game, we're watching the game, there's a corner and then the ball's cleared, the ball goes up to the other end of the pitch and Fulham's on the attack.",
      "\"Then suddenly the ref stops and you're thinking, 'What's going on here?' Now, I know the experience is probably different at home, but if you're in the ground, Oh my. Then you look at, you see a sign saying VAR penalty check. And I was honestly sitting there and I said 'For which team, who to?'",

      "Ruben Amorim has claimed Manchester United were \"not prepared\" to play in the Europa League last season.",
      "United reached the Europa League final and were the only unbeaten team across the three UEFA competitions until their limp defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the final.",
      "As United progressed in Europe, their domestic form worsened and they won seven of their 27 Premier League matches after Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager in November. United eventually finished 15th, their worst top-flight finish since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "The club only qualified for the Europa League through winning the 2024 FA Cup final against Manchester City, having ended the league campaign in eighth.",
      "United aborted plans to sack Ten Hag in the summer following the cup triumph and invested more than £200million on five new signings only to dismiss the Dutchman nine league games into last season.",
      "United commence their domestic cup schedule against League Two side Grimsby Town in the League Cup second round on Wednesday. With no European football this season, United have a lighter workload and Amorim is set to make wholesale changes at Blundell Park.",
      "\"We have three games this week and we have quality players and we need to do rotation to try to win every game,\" Amorim stressed. \"It is a normal thing that happens in other clubs [to have no European football].",
      "\"We were not prepared to play in Europe. That is my feeling, to have strong games in Europe and play in the Premier League. We need time to develop as a team. They just need to fight for the places. Then everything can change.",
      "\"Sometimes one is playing, at other moments, another is going to play. We have the cups, so there will be a lot of games for everybody.",
      "\"We need time to prepare every game. The games are really competitive. We need time to build a base and then in the future, to move forward. We will reach a moment where we need to have Europe for everybody to play games.\"",
      "Andre Onana, Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Ayden Heaven, Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte could all come into the side in midweek. Benjamin Sesko is in contention to make his full debut.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui could return against Burnley in United's final fixture of the month on Saturday. The full back has been sidelined with an unspecified injury for more than a month and only played once in pre-season.",
      "\"Maybe he is going to return next week, we will see,\" Amorim added. \"But he is near. We are just finishing some drills with him to be sure he is not going to have another problem.\"",
      "When asked if Rasmus Hojlund, omitted from the matchday squads against Arsenal and Fulham, could travel to Grimsby, Amorim replied: \"All the players are available, then we make the choice to try to get the best starting XI to win every game.\"",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Headphones on and clutching two iPhones and a washbag, Kobbie Mainoo exited the Manchester United coach via the rear exit on the Stevenage Road.",
      "Plenty of fans hollered, \"Kobbie\" but Mainoo vanished from sight as quickly as he placed the ball past Stefan Ortega in the 2024 FA Cup final. He lingered longer on the Craven Cottage pitch at full-time, anticipating a warm down.",
      "The only ball work Mainoo ended up doing at Fulham was in the warm up, a two-touch exercise that United substitutes favour. That was the happiest Mainoo looked all afternoon.",
      "Without the ball, the 20-year-old appeared glum, almost disillusioned. His smile has been replaced with a forlorn frown. Including pre-season, Mainoo has started in two of United's seven matches.",
      "A first competitive start of the campaign is inevitable at Grimsby Town on Wednesday before a return to the bench against Burnley on Saturday. Then a soul-searching fortnight. Jordan Henderson is proof Thomas Tuchel is not averse to shock England call-ups but a recall for Mainoo is unforeseeable.",
      "The next week is a test of nerve for Mainoo and his agent, David Lockwood. Some agencies have bristled at the number of United academy clients (Tyler Fredricson, Amir Ibragimov, Malachi Sharpe) Lockwood has acquired in recent years, apparently on the strength of Mainoo's development.",
      "Mainoo is no longer as untouchable as he was last summer. There is an acceptance at hierarchical level at United that the one-club man is over in this era of profitability and sustainability rules. Discussions over a new contract are at an impasse. \"No news,\" as Amorim said on Friday.",
      "United have five players ahead of Mainoo in the queue to shift. Daft things can happen in the final week of a window and patience can run out. It is not the time to fret over Mainoo.",
      "Ruben Amorim spoke effusively about him less than four weeks ago. \"With those feet, playing the ball, if he finds the right pace, playing like 'every time I give the ball, I find a new solution. Every time the guy is running back, I can follow the guy because he can'. He's going to be faster.\"",
      "Amorim revealed he is \"on top\" of Mainoo about his rhythm and pace. It was not so much what we saw of Mainoo on tour that was significant but what Amorim said. He spoke about Mainoo with all the confidence of a scientist who had found a cure.",
      "There are some parallels with Arne Slot upgrading Ryan Gravenberch from a peripheral to a pivotal player at Liverpool last season. Gravenberch joined Liverpool on transfer deadline day in September 2023 and it always felt like a mismatch. Jurgen Klopp transformed Liverpool into a force with physical athletes patrolling the midfield and the slight Gravenberch jarred with that profile.",
      "Erik ten Hag wanted Gravenberch at United (of course). Gravenberch's card was probably marked by the mixed results of his fellow Ajax alumni down the East Lancs Road while Ten Hag and Klopp are polar opposites in style and personality.",
      "Under his compatriot Slot, Gravenberch became Liverpool's linchpin and started all but one of their 37 Premier League matches as they regained the title. Gravenberch was named in the PFA Team of the Year last week.",
      "It was in Liverpool's dismantling of United in the third matchweek of last season at Old Trafford that Slot pinpointed where Gravenberch had adapted. \"What impressed me most when I started working with him [was] how much he can run and then still how good he is when he arrives in the duel.",
      "\"Today, you saw with him, Dominik [Szoboszlai] and Macca [Alexis Mac Allister] how much they were able to keep on running. Sometimes you’re late, but then they just kept on running and arriving in the duel. So, that is the one thing that impressed me most about him: how good he also is without the ball.\"",
      "Mainoo could be mistaken for one of the tyros developed by Barcelona. His stature, poise on the ball, slick passing and positional awareness are identical to the Catalan cubs. Mainoo would tear it up in La Liga.",
      "The intensity of the Premier League is unforgiving. Mainoo is no slouch but he has been guilty of lax reactions off the ball. Casemiro was the fall guy for Liverpool's stroll at Old Trafford a year ago but Mainoo was jogging while Gravenberch was sprinting for Luis Diaz's opening goal. Then he was ball-watching for the Colombian's second.",
      "Amorim has noticed that \"even Casemiro\" is operating at a higher pace off the ball. He prefers a midfield partnership of an attacking and defensive persuasion and only briefly settled on a gung-ho set-up in the second half at Fulham with the game goalless.",
      "Nuance is lacking in punditry and Mainoo was billed as United's \"fourth choice\" midfielder on Sunday. That ignored Mount's in-game stint at 0-0 and Manuel Ugarte emerged at 1-0 as Amorim sought to protect the lead.",
      "That Mainoo is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes is hardly a shock. \"Bruno and Kobbie are in the same position,\" Amorim confirmed at Chicago Fire's training complex back on August 1. His quotes 23 days later were more newsworthy as Mainoo had spent almost an entire game sitting behind his manager in the dugout.",
      "The change of coach at United has hitherto been to Mainoo's detriment. Two central midfielders are still accommodated but the dynamics are markedly different in a back three and Mainoo has lined up only 15 times under Amorim. Missing four months of last season denied him that rhythm. Now he has to get up to speed.",
      "Then that smile will return.",

      "Manchester United have under a week to conclude their summer transfer business.",
      "The window closes at 7pm on Monday (September 1), which is earlier than in previous years. United still have work to do in the market and are set to be busy, particularly because outgoings still need to be arranged.",
      "Ruben Amorim has strengthened his squad with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon, but there could be more additions before the deadline.",
      "So we've taken a closer look at the deals United could still complete.",
      "Lammens was omitted from the Royal Antwerp squad last weekend. United are pushing ahead in negotiations to sign the keeper for a reported €20million (£17m) and he is expected to be Amorim's latest recruit.",
      "Lammens, 23, is a young goalkeeper who could challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. He stands at 6ft 3in, represents Belgium Under-21s and is seen as a goalkeeper with a bright future.",
      "United enquired about Baleba earlier in the window. Brighton value the midfielder at around £100m and have planned for him to stay at the Amex Stadium in 2025/2026, so a late move is highly unlikely.",
      "Having said that, football has a tendency to surprise and United haven't made a great start in the Premier League, so could they be tempted to test Brighton's stance with a late bid?",
      "It's possible, of course, but Brighton have expressed confidence that Baleba will stay, and it's probably wishful thinking that United could make a dramatic swoop for the midfielder.",
      "Onana's future is uncertain after he was named on the bench against Fulham last weekend. Amorim persisted with Altay Bayindir, despite his mistake against Arsenal..",
      "United take on Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday. If Onana is not recalled to the starting team, he could make a dramatic move away before the deadline.",
      "For now, sources are adamant that Onana is staying, but a lot can change in a week and the pieces are being moved around the board in the goalkeeper department at Old Trafford.",
      "Chelsea are the frontrunners to sign Alejandro Garnacho, but United are determined not to allow the youngster to leave for a fee below his market value in the final weeks of the transfer window. Garnacho has been training on his own at Carrington since reporting for pre-season in July.",
      "Roma contacted United to discuss Sancho on loan, with an obligation to buy for £20million next summer, but the Italian club could not agree on personal terms with the outcast winger.",
      "Sancho's move to Chelsea broke down due to his wage demands, so the London club decided to pay a £5m penalty charge to United to break their obligation to sign the winger. The 25-year-old needs to be realistic about his expectations for his next destination.",
      "Antony is believed to be holding out for a transfer to Real Betis. The Brazilian was hugely successful during his loan with Betis last season, but the Spanish club are struggling to finance a permanent deal.",
      "The player's agent has left the door open to Saudi Arabia. \"What I can say is that the player is on the market, and there are several clubs that want to know his current status,\" he said. \"We listen to the projects and analyse them. But he is open to moving to Saudi Arabia. Anything is possible.\"",
      "United would have to sell Antony for £32.8m to avoid making a PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) loss, and it would not be a shock to see him join Betis as part of a fresh loan deal.",
      "Hojlund was dropped from the squad to face Arsenal in the Premier League and did not travel to Craven Cottage to face Fulham because he is set to leave before the transfer deadline.",
      "Speaking after Arsenal, Amorim said: \"It is our player - we have to make choices. We have players that have to stay helping the team from the outside. He has to fight for his place. We will see what's going to happen. Rasmus has the same characteristics as Sesko, so sometimes we need to choose.\"",
      "Italian champions, Napoli, are understood to be pushing to wrap up a deal for Hojlund.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute against Arsenal and Fulham, raising concerns about where he fits into the team again. \"He’s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said of Mainoo on Sunday.",
      "Mainoo's contract situation has stalled and the MEN reported in March that there was a genuine chance United and the youngster could go their separate ways in the summer window.",
      "There has been no breakthrough in contract talks and could he better off leaving for regular starts elsewhere?",
      "Malacia celebrated his 26th birthday this week and interest has been thin on the ground following his loan with PSV, although Roma have been linked with a move for the defender.",

      "Ross joined the MEN in August 2021. He was appointed Sport Content Editor in February 2022.",
      "When a team changes manager and the dust settles following the initial hysteria, often one of the first questions to be asked is which players will benefit most from the new man's arrival.",
      "If a manager can start to get a tune out of an expensive recruit who has so far failed to prove their worth, they've instant credit in the bank from fans and those within the club's hierarchy.",
      "But there's a lot more to it than 'they played well under them before and so this time should be no different'. Take Erik ten Hag's arrival at United as an example.",
      "The Dutchman was keen to surround himself with home comforts, regularly targeting players either from, or who had spent time in, the Eredivisie. Yet, having inherited a player he had coached previously at Ajax in Donny van de Beek, he failed to get the best out of the midfielder, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had before him, and Van de Beek was shipped off to Girona after playing just eight league games in two years under Ten Hag.",
      "When Ruben Amorim was appointed United manager in November 2024, it would be wrong to suggest there was instant hope that he could get the best out of Manuel Ugarte. The pair worked together at Sporting Lisbon, and with Ugarte not even three months into his United career, the jury was well and truly still out on the Uruguayan.",
      "Fast forward nine months and there is a real worry Amorim will not get to see the best of the 24-year-old midfielder at United.",
      "Ugarte was brought to United for a fee rising to £50.75million on transfer deadline day last summer. The Uruguay international was signed to be the successor to Casemiro in United's midfield, yet the man he was brought in to replace has started ahead of him in both Premier League games so far this season.",
      "The former Paris Saint-Germain star showed glimpses of promise during pre-season, most notably against West Ham where he was one of the best players on the pitch in a 2-1 win in New Jersey. He again looked bright off the bench against Bournemouth, but regressed dramatically against Everton in the final game of the US tour and has not been seen in a starting XI since.",
      "Opting to start the 33-year-old Casemiro in Premier League games, as brilliant as he once was, is an admission of defeat.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 by the time the 2025/26 season comes to an end, and having been on a downward slope for more than 18 months, having him as one of your starting central midfielders when the bell rings at 7pm on September 1 simply isn't an option.",
      "It's up to Amorim to make it work with Ugarte, but if he thinks Casemiro is a safer bet in midfield than the man he worked with at Sporting Lisbon then he clearly doesn't think it will work.",
      "There's still time for deals to be done before the transfer window closes. Over to you, United.",

      "With just seven days of the transfer window remaining, United know they will have to act quickly to get any deals tied up - and it looks as if their next summer signing is on the way.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is set to make the move to Old Trafford, having missed the Belgian side’s match against Mechelen on Sunday. Lammens is expected to seal a £17m transfer to United.",
      "That move is expected to place further doubt on the futures of Andre Onana and Altiy Bayindir. Ruben Amorim again chose Banindir as his starting goalkeeper for the 1-1 draw at Fulham at the weekend.",
      "United were also linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma but the Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper looks to be heading to Manchester City.",
      "Meanwhile, United captain Bruno Fernandes continues to draw interest from Saudi Arabia, while Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund could all leave the club within the next seven days.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest Manchester United transfer news, rumours and updates throughout the day...",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid are monitoring Mainoo's situation.",
      "A season-long loan could reportedly interest the two Spanish clubs, though several Premier League sides are also keeping tabs on the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo has yet to feature in Manchester United’s first two Premier League matches this season. However, it is thought unlikely that United would approve a loan move for a player they are not actively looking to sell.",
      "Chelsea have reportedly been seeking a bargain for Alejandro Garnacho, with an initial offer of around £25–35 million, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, have long insisted on a £50 million fee for the Argentina international. However, Chelsea's position is strengthened by Garnacho’s preference to join them, having reportedly resisted approaches from other clubs.",
      "Manchester United academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo continues to be linked with a summer switch away from Old Trafford having struggled to nail down a spot on Ruben Amorim's starting XI.",
      "When recently asked about Mainoo's future at the club, Amorim stated it was down to director of football Jason Wilcox to agree new terms with players.\"That part is with Jason, so he is our player,\" Amorim said. \"He has a contract, I didn’t hear any news about that.\"",
      "A recent report from The Athletic claims Mainoo 'is open to leave Manchester United' due to Amorim prefering other midfield options, though the England international's options are limited. It would come as a major disappointment for the United faithful if Mainoo were to depart, given the Stockport-born star has already made it clear that playing for Manchester United has been a dream of his since joining the academy as a nine-year-old.",
      "\"To start playing in the Premier League for my boyhood club has been amazing. Now it's about trying to win more games.\"",
      "The Daily Mail claims Chelsea are still confident they can seal a cut-price deal for Alejandro Garnacho before the transfer deadline on September 1.",
      "The report claims the Blues are hopeful of a deal in the region of £35million, down from the £50million asking price that has been doing the rounds this summer.",
      "The 21-year-old has reportedly set his sight on joining Chelsea, with the Blues the only club he'll join.",
      "Ahead of Manchester United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, there was a debate about who would partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Following the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the attacking ranks, it was inevitable Fernandes would be deployed as one of the two No.8s. He frequently dropped deep last season and was often more effective from the engine room.",
      "Despite regressing in each of the last two Premier League campaigns, Casemiro was given the nod for the season curtain-raiser. He was tasked with keeping order in midfield.",
      "Into the final year of his United contract and turning 34 next February, many believed the club should have pushed to sell the Brazilian this summer. Instead, he has started each of the Reds' opening two games, having kept his place for Sunday's stalemate at Fulham.",
      "As a result of partnering Fernandes once again, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo were on the bench for the second game running. And just like against Arsenal, Ugarte was the one called upon by Ruben Amorim during the second half while Mainoo was not.",
      "You can read more from George Smith here.",
      "Manchester United will be hoping to wrap-up a deal for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens by the end of this week as the transfer window approaches its conclusion.",
      "A new goalkeeper has not been ruled out as a possible late addition by United - although they are not planning on purchasing an undisputed No.1 between the posts.",
      "It currently remains unclear who Ruben Amorim's favoured goalkeeper is this season. Andre Onana is yet to feature for United after being left out of the squad against Arsenal - and only making the subs bench at Fulham.",
      "Altay Bayindir has started both games - and hasn't impressed as much as he would have liked. Lammens is thought to be close to becoming United's fourth senior goalkeeper - alongside Tom Heaton.",
      "Lammens missed Antwerp's win over KV Mechelen on Sunday, amid speculation over his future. It's been reported that United will pay £16million plus add-ons for the goalkeeper, who is expected to sign a five-year contract.",

Indeed, according to Fabrizio Romano, Stefano Pioli's side are in talks over a surprise deal to sign Lindelof, who is a free agent after leaving United back in June.",

      "Manchester United academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo continues to be linked with a summer switch away from Old Trafford having struggled to nail down a spot on Ruben Amorim's starting XI.",
      "The England international has been in talks with United over a new deal, but the 20-year-old turned down the club's initial proposal at the start of 2025, with Chelsea linked with a move for the midfielder back in the January transfer window.",
      "Mainoo endured two length injury lay-offs last season and has started just 15 games since Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford. He has two-years remaining on the deal he signed when he was a 17-year-old, with his contract set to expire in 2027, though United do have the option of an additional year.",
      "When recently asked about Mainoo's future at the club, Amorim stated it was down to director of football Jason Wilcox to agree new terms with players.\"That part is with Jason, so he is our player,\" Amorim said. \"He has a contract, I didn’t hear any news about that.\"",
      "Although Mainoo has struggled for minutes and hasn't yet started a game this season, the lack of central midfield options means he'll likely stay at the club beyond the September deadline. Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped speculation increasing in relation to Mainoo's future.",
      "A recent report from The Athletic claims Mainoo 'is open to leave Manchester United' due to Amorim prefering other midfield options, though the England international's options are limited.",
      "It would come as a major disappointment for the United faithful if Mainoo were to depart, given the Stockport-born star has already made it clear that playing for Manchester United has been a dream of his since joining the academy as a nine-year-old.",
      "\"To start playing in the Premier League for my boyhood club has been amazing. Now it's about trying to win more games.\"",
      "Unlike the Janaury transfer window, where Mainoo was heavily linked with a move to Premier League rivals Chelsea, there's been very little speculation about his future.",
      "Leeds United have been linked with a move for the England international, though there's very little to suggest the newly promoted side will make a move at this stage, especially seeing as Daniel Farke admitted his midfield transfer business was complete earlier this month.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders and it is a different way of playing,\" Amorim made clear ahead of the trip to Fulham last weekend, regarding Mainoo's lack of minutes. \"They have to understand, the young players, there are phases in the season.",
      "\"Nowadays it's normal, with a lot of games, things are going to change. But he is there, he is fighting, he is training, he is one more option for us to win games.\"",

    "body": [
      "Two weeks into the 2025/26 Premier League season and some teams have already started to demonstrate their ambitions. Following the opening rounds of games, an alternative view of the table has emerged that provides interesting viewing.",
      "Over the weekend, there were some noticeable results. Manchester City suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham on Saturday before Manchester United's frustrations continued with a 1-1 draw at Fulham.",
      "Champions Liverpool, unconvincingly, made it two wins from two on Monday night at Newcastle thanks to 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha's injury-time winner. Chelsea also caught the eye with an emphatic 5-1 win over West Ham United.",
      "With 36 rounds of matches to go, there is plenty of football to play. But with help from stats specialists Opta, a table based on the expected goals for each team has been produced which provides a specific metric of performance so far.",
      "Expected goals (xG) is a metric calculated based on the value of opportunities and shots on goal from each Premier League team and has become a widely-used measure to evaluate teams and performances. It provides an estimate of the number of goals a team should have theoretically scored.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The table uses statistics and data from the first two games of the season. No surprise, after the resounding win over West Ham on Friday, Chelsea top the table with an xG of 4.35, despite failing to score in the 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace.",
      "Behind them is Arsenal with 4.19 xG after scoring six in their first two games. It means the Gunners have outperformed their xG by 1.81. Elsewhere, United's early problems in the final third are clear with Leny Yoro's goal on Sunday, from a corner, their only one this season so far.",
      "According to the data, Ruben Amorim's men have an xG of 3.15, which is 2.15 goals below what they have actually scored. Only Brighton (-2.91) have a worse 'Goals vs XG' ratio after they failed to score against Everton at the weekend.",
      "Man City's xG sits at 4.02, which largely comes from the 4-0 win at Wolves. Following their dramatic win at Newcastle, Liverpool have an xG of 2.9 despite scoring seven goals in their first two games.",
      "Nottingham Forest have an xG of 2.76, despite scoring four goals, while Brentford are underperforming their 2.70 xG with two goals scored so far. Newcastle's is slightly lower than the Reds at 2.4.",
      "Tottenham and Sunderland have both scored more than what the xG portrays. Thomas Frank's men have scored five times compared to the 3.43 xG whereas the Black Cats' blank at Burnley still has them outperforming their xG of 1.53.",

      "Manchester United will be hoping to join Manchester City in the third round of the Carabao Cup when they face Grimsby Town at Blundell Park on Wednesday night.",
      "As a result of failing to qualify for Europe for this season, United are entering the competition at the second round stage for the first time since 2014. Those who are participating in Europe do not enter the competition until the third round.",
      "Therefore, United will have to overcome the League Two Mariners to join the likes of City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea in the third round draw.",
      "The Reds reached the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup last season, exiting the competition just before Christmas after a 4-3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. City were knocked out of the competition by Spurs in the previous round, losing 2-1.",
      "Unlike for the second round draw that was made earlier this month, the third round draw will be made following the conclusion of all second round ties and will immediately follow the conclusion of United's clash with Grimsby, at approximately 10pm.",
      "Outlining how the third round will unfold, the EFL said in a statement: \"Following the expansion of the European competition calendar ahead of the 2024/25 season, the EFL will again be required to implement additional conditions for the Carabao Cup Round Three draw.",
      "\"In-line with last year's competition, this season's Carabao Cup Round Three fixtures will take place across two weeks (beginning 15 and 22 September), with fixtures in the Champions League (week beginning 15 September) and Europa League (week beginning 22 September) also scheduled during this period.",
      "\"As UEFA competition fixtures cannot be rescheduled, and to enable the Carabao Cup to proceed within its agreed schedule without disrupting other League or domestic cup fixtures, the additional conditions will ensure that Clubs participating in the Champions League or Europa League cannot meet each other in Round Three of the League Cup.",
      "\"This will ensure that both teams drawn in each tie will be able to fulfil the fixture in one of the allocated weeks.",
      "\"It would always be the EFL's preference to conduct the draw in the traditional manner, but these changes have been forced upon us for the second season in succession as a result of UEFA's failure to consult with the Leagues of Europe prior to finalising its competition schedule.\"",
      "Offering more information on how the draw will work, the EFL added: \"For the main draw, two separate bowls will be utilised – one consisting of the eight UCL (Champions League) and UEL Clubs (Europa League), and one consisting of the remaining 24 Clubs.",
      "\"As the balls will be split across two pots, a pre-draw will be required first to determine whether each of the eight UCL/UEL teams will be playing home or away.",
      "\"For the main draw, the first eight-ties will be drawn by alternating between one Club from Bowl 1 and one Club from Bowl 2, with the Home/Away positioning of the UCL/UEL team already pre-determined in the earlier draw.",
      "\"Once the first eight ties featuring the UCL/UEL teams have been drawn, the remaining eight ties will then be drawn from Bowl 2 only.\"",
      "The ball numbers are yet to be confirmed for the draw.",

      "Lammens is understood to be an active target for United and while club sources insist the deal is not as close to being done as is being widely reported, the 23-year-old could still end up at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "It all adds to the intrigue around Lammens, with the current Antwerp stopper likely to put further pressure on Onana if he does sign for United.",
      "Onana was signed on the back of starring as Inter reached the 2023 Champions League final, with the Reds trumpeting his ability to play out. But there remain question marks over Onana more than two years since his arrival and he has produced some erratic moments between the posts.",
      "It's a similar story for Bayindir, who has largely failed to impress when given the opportunity.",
      "It opens a potential door for Lammens and he would provide an assuredness that Onana and Bayindir have so far failed to offer.",
      "The 'keeper is a decent distributor and his shot-stopping would be a level above the former Inter man. Lammens is a commanding presence in goal and an excellent shot stopper - according to Opta Analyst, he prevented 17.4 goals from being scored in the Belgian Pro League in 2024-25.",
      "Those attributes coupled with his calming influence on a backline would be welcome at Old Trafford and provide the sort of stability United have been seeking between the posts, as Lammens himself said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",
      "\"They always say that I stay level emotionally. That I'm stable and never go up or down too quickly. I'm happy about that, by the way. I think that's a good quality for a goalkeeper.\"",
      "It's a quality United haven't seen enough of from their current custodians. Lammens has it in spades.",

      "Although United played really well against Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season and should have been out of sight by half-time against Fulham at Craven Cottage on Sunday, their opening two results have done little to inspire confidence.",
      "Performances are one thing, and United's opening two this season have offered plenty of encouragement, but this is a results-driven business, and the Reds have made a disappointing start on that front.",
      "Since succeeding Erik ten Hag last November, Ruben Amorim has won just 17 of his 44 matches in charge. In the Premier League, he has a paltry seven wins from 29 games.",
      "While you cannot ignore the fact he inherited a mess last season and was tasked with installing a style of play that was alien to most members of his squad, results are what count in football and Amorim has not been on the right side of enough of them since becoming United head coach.",
      "Calls from some United supporters to dismiss the Portuguese chief just two games into the season are, however, simply ridiculous. Amorim needed this summer to fix the squad and there are still a few days left of the transfer window for him to secure the tools he needs.",
      "Nevertheless, there is still pressure on him to deliver results sooner rather than later to avoid fanciful calls for him to be dismissed to become that little bit more believable and substantial.",
      "\"There are no excuses now for the manager this season,\" former United striker Wayne Rooney said on his BBC podcast earlier this week. \"He's got to start getting results and getting results quickly because once you start getting into October, November, if results don't change drastically, then that's when pressure comes.\"",
      "Rooney isn't wrong. Despite going through managers and head coaches like they are going out of fashion in recent years, United, as much as they need a sense of continuity, do need to get results on the board.",
      "The first international break of the season is almost upon us, and the prospect of going into the first lull of the campaign on the back of a sequence of negative results is going to do little for the mood over the course of the hiatus.",
      "On the face of it, United could not have requested two better opportunities to sign off for the temporary pause, facing League Two side Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round on Wednesday night and then Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "With the utmost respect to both sides, United should be winning both games. Anything less will be frowned upon, meaning there is arguably bigger pressure on Saturday's game than the midweek trip to the Lincolnshire coast.",
      "A negative result in either will only strengthen Rooney's argument.",

      "Ahead of Manchester United's Premier League opener against Arsenal, there was a debate about who would partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Following the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo to the attacking ranks, it was inevitable Fernandes would be deployed as one of the two No.8s. He frequently dropped deep last season and was often more effective from the engine room.",
      "Despite regressing in each of the last two Premier League campaigns, Casemiro was given the nod for the season curtain-raiser. He was tasked with keeping order in midfield.",
      "Into the final year of his United contract and turning 34 next February, many believed the club should have pushed to sell the Brazilian this summer. Instead, he has started each of the Reds' opening two games, having kept his place for Sunday's stalemate at Fulham.",
      "As a result of partnering Fernandes once again, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo were on the bench for the second game running. And just like against Arsenal, Ugarte was the one called upon by Ruben Amorim during the second half while Mainoo was not.",
      "It means the 20-year-old is still waiting to make his first Premier League appearance of the season. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who predicted Mainoo would remain glued to the bench for United's opening two games.",
      "Although he has just under two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, the England international's future at the club is in doubt. Amorim indicated last week that no progress has been made on tying him down to a new deal.",
      "Amorim has struggled to settle on Mainoo's best position since arriving at United, tasking him with playing as a No.8, a No.10 and even as a false nine. It is no secret he is a forward-thinking player, meaning, in Amorim's defence, it is hard to justify playing him alongside Fernandes in the centre of midfield amid the duo's attacking intentions.",
      "It is why Amorim had a point when he said after the draw at Craven Cottage that Mainoo and Fernandes are competing for the same role.",
      "\"He's fighting for the position now with Bruno,\" Amorim said. \"And I change two midfielders. I let Mason Mount [play] there because we want to score a goal and when I changed I felt the team need to return to one holding midfielder near Bruno.",
      "\"So he (Mainoo) just needs to fight for the position with Bruno, as [it] should be at Manchester United. [Sometimes] he's going to play with Bruno, but at the moment he's fighting in training with Bruno for the position.\"",
      "With less than a week of the window left, United still want to sign a midfielder. They want a player of an athletic profile that can seemingly compliment Fernandes' characteristics in the engine room.",
      "The prospect of bringing in a suitable partner risks pushing Mainoo even further down the pecking order. And if that situation transpires, United, who still need to generate cash via sales this summer, could find themselves in a position where they are prepared to cash-in on a player who not all that long ago was considered as their crown jewel.",
      "As a result of not currently being at the forefront of Amorim's plans, United, if chief executive Omar Berrada's comments about player sales are anything to go by, might be willing to cash-in on the academy graduate.",
      "\"When it comes to sales, we will do it purely on the basis of whether it helps improve the team or not, not for financial reasons,\" Berrada said back in March.",
      "Given Mainoo has played no part in United's opening two games, the club may be prepared to sanction an exit if an avenue of opportunity opens up in the coming days.",
      "If Amorim has no plans to play Mainoo in a prominent role, they should consider letting him go if the price is right. A player of his talent deserves to be playing.",

      "Amorim was also asked about the incident, but the United boss refused to get drawn into speculation that he was put off. “He knows the importance that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team,\" he said.",

[De Bruyne] doesn't need any advice; I need advice from him!",

      "\"Why? Because Man City want to go for Donnarumma. City want to sign Donnarumma IF Ederson goes to Galatasaray. The negotiations between Man Utd and Royal Antwerp for Senne Lammens are advancing very well.",
      "\"Very good negotiations, the package requested is €20m. There is a negotiation ongoing on deal structure and fee, still not a done deal between the clubs. It’s agreed with the player because Lammens already said yes to Manchester United. The arrival of Lammens – if it happens – doesn’t mean that Andre Onana is going to leave Man Utd.\"",
      "AS Roma director Frederic Massara confirms that nothing has changed since Monday following Jadon Sancho’s decision to turn down a move.",
      "He said: \"Sancho is a strong player who has been linked to all the big Italian teams. At the moment, he remains a suggestion because I don't think the conditions, especially the motivation, are there to pursue this negotiation.\"",
      "Fernandes is reportedly drawing interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad - and his potential exit could provide a significant boost for Man United when it comes to their transfer kitty.",
      "The Sun reported Al-Ittihad have held discussions with Fernandes' representatives - and they were described as positive. The midfielder is said to be 'open' to the move - and is understood to have requested a contract worth approximately £33million-a-year. Although that doesn't necessarily mean their captain, Fernandes, will be leaving - a potential departure would, of course, provide them with a significant financial boost, freeing up funds that could be reinvested into their squad or used to secure high-profile targets.",
      "On Baleba, the club's hierarchy have opted to wait (at least) another year before trying to get a deal over the line. Brighton & Hove Albion have valued the 21-year-old in excess of £100million and are adamant Baleba is not for sale.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Manchester City are reportedly eyeing a move to hijack Man United's pursuit of Lammens.",
      "The Reds have been negotiating with Royal Antwerp over the goalkeeper, with personal terms already agreed. In a surprising development, Sacha Tavolieri claims that City are now considering signing the Belgian shot-stopper as a potential replacement for Ederson.",
      "Previously, Gianluigi Donnarumma had been City's primary target in goal, but Paris Saint-Germain’s valuation of the Italian is considered ‘too steep’.",
      "Man United face Fulham on Sunday in their first Premier League away match of the campaign.",
      "The Reds are set to make changes to their side following the defeat to the Gunners, with Andre Onana in line to replace Altay Bayindir in goal. The Turkey international was at fault for Arsenal's winner and Onana is now fit and has travelled to the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could be given a full debut having come off the bench last time out with United opting to play with a false nine. If the Slovenia striker does start it could be the first time United fans will see their new attacking trio from the off with Mathues Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo having also signed this summer.",
      "Amad will be hoping for a recall having been surprisingly left out of the starting XI against Mikel Arteta's side but Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui will miss the game through injury.",
      "Confirmed United travelling squad members vs Fulham: Onana, Bayindir, Heaton, De Ligt, Dalot, Fredricson, Shaw, Yoro, Heaven, Dorgu, Maguire, Ugarte, Mainoo, Casemiro, Mount, Amad, Fernandes, Cunha, Mbeumo, Sesko, Zirkzee",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims more positive talks were held between Man United and Napoli.",
      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"Understand Napoli are now advancing in talks to sign Rasmus Hojlund. Positive talks today with Hojlund and his camp about contract terms and project for long term.",
      "\"Manchester United are informed about talks and ready to get deal done if Højlund and Napoli agree on terms.\"",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes understand that United are eyeing up a move for Sevilla midfielder Agoume.",
      "After deciding against pursuing a move for Carlos Baleba, United could still sign a new midfielder before the September 1 deadline. The report suggests that Agoume could be available for a fee ranging from £21.7m to £30.4m.",
      "According to reports, United have set their sights on Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",
      "It's suggested that Stiller has a £31.5 million release clause, but it only becomes active in 2026, meaning United would likely need to pay a premium to secure him immediately.",
      "The Mail understands that Onana is expected to stay at Man United despite speculation the club may move for Senne Lammens.",
      "\"Onana is ready to play like last week so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper,\" Amorim said in his press-conference.",
      "The report claims that both United and Onana anticipate he will stay beyond the transfer window, which closes a week on Monday, despite Monaco having been quoted £30million earlier in the summer and the possibility of renewed interest from his former club Inter Milan.",
      "Meanwhile, Lammens is thought to be seen as a long-term option in goal and is expected to challenge Onana, whose future has been uncertain following a string of inconsistent displays last season."

      "20) 🆕 Kobbie Mainoo – Manchester United to Leeds United\nMainoo is reportedly willing to leave after being snubbed by Ruben Amorim *again*. While Chelsea (or a foreign club) are far more likely to sign him, this has not stopped Leeds United from submitting an ‘ambitious approach’ for the England international. You can’t fault a trier…",

      "",
      "18) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",

      "",
      "16) 🆕 Conor Gallagher – Atletico Madrid to Crystal Palace\nGallagher is reportedly open to a return to the Premier League, with the club he spent 2022/23 on loan at interested. It would be a loan deal but it all hinges on Atletico’s wishes.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Manuel Akanji – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nThe City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray, while Crystal Palace have also made a play for the veteran, and Bayer Leverkusen could pursue if Piero Hincapie leaves. City are likely to encourage his departure given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay and hasn’t agreed terms with Gala despite a £15m bid being accepted last week. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "14) Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar amid conflicting reports on whether he would serve as a replacement for the Swede or Callum Wilson. Either way, a move is ‘increasingly unlikely’ as Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "13) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "12) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",
      "",
      "11) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "9) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first and while Spurs are ‘planning a hijack’, that’ll probably fail.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Piero Hincapie – Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal\nSpurs made a proposal for Hincapie and then it quickly emerged that Arsenal are also keen. Will some hijacking history hilariously repeat itself after the Ebere Eze debacle? That would be quite something and is looking increasingly likely with personal terms reached, though the Gunners need to let one or two go before they can land the Ecuadorian defender, who has a 60 million euro release clause.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano continues to insist that a ‘deal is very advanced’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "6) 🆕 Yeremy Pino – Villarreal to Crystal Palace\nWanted by Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs over the years, Palace have reportedly agreed terms with the exciting Spaniard as their replacement for Ebere Eze.",
      "",
      "5) Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him, though it’s currently being reported that a private ‘meeting’ could lead to a ‘dramatic U-turn’.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Bayern Munich \nNot another one! Jackson is the latest striker that Newcastle United could miss out on, with Chelsea in agreement with Bayern Munich over a loan deal for their unwanted forward.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jakub Kiwior – Arsenal to Porto\nThis will open the door for Hincapie’s move to Arsenal, whose woeful ability to sell players will sting them again here. Kiwior has proven himself as a top player, especially against Real Madrid in the Champions League, but it looks like the Gunners will pretty much break even with a £23m sale.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnarumma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal, but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Napoli, meanwhile, have had a breakthrough, with Fabrizio Romano saying a deal is at the ‘final stages’ for Romelu Lukaku’s replacement after former team-mate Scott McTominay got on the blower…",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘taken drastic action’ to ‘complete’ three transfers, while a ‘surprise’ outcome for Jadon Sancho looms.",
      "This summer transfer window has been a mixed bag for Man Utd, who have invested around £120m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "However, the Red Devils are still crying out for upgrades in other positions, with reports suggesting that their priority is to sign a new goalkeeper and a centre-midfielder in the coming days.",
      "Any potential incomings likely hinge on exits, though Ruben Amorim‘s side are struggling to offload their unwanted talents as their clear desperation has impacted their negotiating power.",
      "Marcus Rashford is currently the only member of United’s so-called ‘bomb squad’ to leave the Premier League giants in this window, as Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are yet to move elsewhere.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League upgrades of the summer: Liverpool striker swap, Mbeumo and Cunha…",
      "Man Utd are also looking to offload Rasmus Hojlund following the arrival of Sesko, with reports speculating that a deal with Serie A giants Napoli will be completed ‘within 48 hours’.",
      "To ‘complete’ transfers for Hojlund, Garnacho and Sancho, a report from Football Insider claims the Red Devils have ‘taken drastic action’, with the club ‘slashing the asking prices of their big-name bomb squad to get exit deals over the line’.",
      "Sancho’s future has been in doubt since returning to Man Utd following his unsuccessful loan spell at Chelsea, who paid a reported £5m penalty fee to opt out of a permanent deal.",
      "The Englishman has subsequently been linked with several Premier League and European sides, with a move to AS Roma recently looking likely until he pulled the plug on the deal.",
      "Despite this, Caught Offside are reporting that Sancho’s Man Utd ‘nightmare’ will soon be ‘over’ as an outcome is ‘expected’.",
      "Following Sancho’s snub of Roma, Turkish giants Besiktas are said to be a ‘surprising late contender’ to secure his services.",
      "‘Now, Besiktas have emerged as a surprising late contender. The Turkish giants are keen to capitalise on their extended transfer window, which remains open until September 12, long after most of Europe has closed business.",
      "‘Besiktas have already reached an agreement with United over the transfer fee, meaning the move depends solely on Sancho’s decision. Should the winger give the green light, the deal could be wrapped up swiftly, handing Sancho the opportunity for a fresh start in Istanbul.’",
      "Garnacho, meanwhile, is ‘expected’ to finalise a move to Chelsea at some point this week, with journalist Ben Jacobs confirming that ‘terms are in place’.",
      "He said on X: ‘Chelsea expected to sign Alejandro Garnacho despite seeing multiple bids rejected. Clubs likely to reach an agreement this week. Terms in place with Garnacho.",
      "‘#CFC focused on other outgoings as well, including Tyrique George to Roma.’",
      "The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed Kobbie Mainoo’s decision on leaving Manchester United before this summer window closes.",
      "Manchester City have raised almost £300m selling players who never even represented them, which is one of the greatest secrets to their success.",
      "With time ticking down to the end of the transfer window, Jadon Sancho’s agents demands may well be the reason why he has yet to seal a move.",
      "Jadon Sancho’s stance over the September deadline could force Man Utd into a loan move and hamper Ruben Amorim’s plans for late transfer business.",
      "According to reports, Rasmus Hojlund is ‘close’ to leaving Manchester United, while Fabrizio Romano has revealed a significant update on Jadon Sancho.",
      "Man Utd have ‘reached an agreement’ with Roma to sell Jadon Sancho as the Serie A side ‘work to agree personal terms’, according to reports."

      "10) Jacob Murphy to Anthony Elanga (Newcastle United)\nMurphy’s Premier League numbers last season were more than respectable (eight goals, 12 assists), but nobody really believes those numbers are sustainable. Newcastle clearly don’t, which is why they moved for Elanga.",
      "The Swede’s blistering pace already makes him one of the most dangerous wingers in the division, and while Murphy impressed in 2024/25, he’s not the long-term answer on the right. Once Elanga settles, he should become a genuine asset and goal threat, and Murphy will be back in his more natural role as a handy back-up.",
      "",
      "9) Fabian Schar to Malick Thiaw (Newcastle United)\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe is known for taking his time with new signings, so Schar’s long-term replacement might not get the nod immediately. But when Thiaw does settle, it’ll be for good – until he inevitably joins Liverpool in 2028.",
      "Thiaw is one of the few Newcastle summer targets who actually wanted to join and could form a top-class partnership with Sven Botman if he gets back to the 2022/23 levels that first caught the eye. Schar’s been a great servant, but this is the beginning of the end.",
      "",
      "8) Manchester United bomb squad to Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo\nIt’s a definite upgrade on Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford. But let’s be honest: This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo looked sharp on debut against Arsenal, constantly troubling the Gunners’ defence, but couldn’t find a way past David Raya. There’s plenty to like about them, yet history tells us even world-class players have crumbled at Old Trafford. Proceed with cautious optimism.",
      "",
      "7) Robin Olsen to Marco Bizot (Aston Villa)\nThis is a monumental upgrade on one of the weakest back-up goalkeepers in the division, perhaps the biggest on this list. But it is a back-up goalkeeper so we’re not moved enough to put this one any higher.",
      "Bizot kept a clean sheet on his Villa debut against Newcastle and looked very confident, which makes supporters more confident and, more importantly, those in front of him on the grass.",
      "Not only has Unai Emery improved in the goalkeeper department, but he’s added a No.2 capable of usurping Emi Martinez, or at least stepping in if the two-time Yashin Trophy winner gets the summer move he expected back in May.",
      "",
      "6) Illan Meslier to Lucas Perri (Leeds United)\nLeeds fans hailed this as a huge upgrade before even seeing Perri in their shirt — Meslier was that bad. Last season’s calamities, including his horror show against Sunderland, meant Daniel Farke had no choice but to drop him for Karl Darlow during the promotion run-in.",
      "Perri conceded five against Arsenal but showed enough presence to settle any nerves. And after watching Meslier flap at crosses like a malfunctioning wind turbine, that’s already a win.",
      "",
      "5) Darwin Nunez to Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool)\nEkitike has announced himself quickly at Liverpool, scoring and assisting in the 4-2 win against Bournemouth, before netting at Newcastle and after bagging in the Community Shield. Concerns about Bundesliga tax and his PSG struggles now look a little overblown.",
      "Tall, quick and technically slick, he looks absolutely fantastic. And unlike Nunez, he doesn’t spend half the game looking like he’s tripping over his own shoelaces.",
      "",
      "4) Ilkay Gundogan to Tijjani Reijnders (Manchester City)\nWhat a debut. Reijnders looked right at home pulling Wolves apart, and it’s already hard to imagine City without him. His ball-carrying, creativity and eye for goal make him the perfect heir to Gundogan.",
      "The German’s second stint in Manchester has been underwhelming, but if Reijnders can chip in with big goals like Gundogan once did, he’ll be a hero in no time. This is a proper City signing: seamless, smart, and slightly terrifying for everyone else.",
      "",
      "3) Dan Neil to Granit Xhaka (Sunderland)\nNo disrespect to Neil — he didn’t need replacing — but when a player of Xhaka’s calibre becomes available, you don’t say no.",
      "He’s walked straight in as captain, which tells you everything. The risk, of course, is that Sunderland get the Xhaka who blows up and tells the fans where to go. But if they get the Xhaka of the last three years, the Black Cats have every chance of staying up.",
      "",
      "2) Kai Havertz/Mikel Merino/Gabriel Jesus to Viktor Gyokeres (Arsenal)\nIt was tempting to label this ‘Whoever to Gyokeres’ given how muddled Arsenal’s striker options were; Havertz, Merino and Jesus all had turns, and signing a new centre-forward was the club’s biggest priority going into the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres scored a brace on his home debut to avoid the dreaded early drought and shock kick on from here.",
      "",
      "1) Jack Harrison to Jack Grealish (Everton)\nIt took about 90 minutes for Grealish to remind everyone what he can do, assisting both goals in Everton’s 2-0 win over Brighton.",
      "Is he strictly an upgrade on Harrison? Maybe not — but in one start he matched Harrison’s 38-game tally for goal involvements last season. For David Moyes, for Everton, and possibly for England in a World Cup year, this could be the transfer that gets Grealish’s career back on track.",
      "",
      "Piero Hincapie has ‘agreed’ terms with Arsenal as the Gunners eye TWO more signings, while three Manchester United deals are close…",
      "Did Florian Wirtz look like a British record transfer player as Liverpool played Newcastle? Plus, Unai Emery sack chat.",
      "“Hello, is that Liverpool? We’re just calling to say that we want to negotiate on the Alexander Isak fee…”",
      "Manchester City have raised almost £300m selling players who never even represented them, which is one of the greatest secrets to their success.",
      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Newcastle v Liverpool was fun, right? But Liverpool have got some big issues and probably need Marc Guehi to sign quite soon."

      "Marcus Rashford and Man Utd have been sent a ‘clear message’ by Barcelona over his potential to earn a permanent transfer in the summer, according to reports.",
      "The England international spent the second half of last season out on loan at Aston Villa after falling out with Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim, who said he’d rather play his goalkeeping coach than the forward.",
      "He had a decent spell on loan at Aston Villa, leading to another temporary move to Barcelona over the summer with the Catalan giants having a €30m buyout clause if he impresses over the season.",
      "However, his first couple of matches for Barcelona have not quite gone to plan with Rashford left on the bench for the season opener against Mallorca before being taken off at half-time in his full debut against Levante.",
      "The Catalans found themselves 2-0 down at half-time against Levante with Rashford the player to pay the price for their poor performance as they went on to win 3-2.",
      "Explaining Rashford’s substitution, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick told reporters: “Of course, the second half, we have to change something. Raphinha on the [left] side is our No 11.",
      "READ: Man Utd transfer to be completed ‘within 48 hours’ after €45m package is sealed",
      "“He knows everything [about how we play]; what we want to do when he has to come inside.",
      "“I think we got the right changes. But of course, when we score the first goal so early in the second half, it helps a lot for us and changed the strategy.”",
      "Despite his decision to take the Man Utd loanee off, Flick was satisfied with Rashford’s contribution, he added: “I think Marcus had some situations in the first half where he showed how good he is and how he can help us.",
      "“This is, for me, where we have to continue.”",
      "Commenting on Rashford’s performance in the 45 minutes he got, Spanish football expert Guillem Balague told Premier Sports: “At half time I think the experiment finished.”",
      "Before adding: “I think his teammates need to help him, the team was a little slow with [Marc] Casado in the middle, so when he had the ball he only really had the chance to do his thing which he did a couple of times when his explosive pace helped him to create a chance which he had that was well saved.",
      "“I felt that he needed to understand that against a team that was playing very deep it required them to be a little more patient and required a player to play between the lines, and he’s not that type of player.”",
      "And now reports in Spain claim that Rashford ‘has already received a clear message: if he wants to stay in Barcelona permanently, he must offer much more than he has shown so far.’",
      "His performances so far have ‘already led to doubts within the locker room and coaching staff about whether Rashford is worth the club’s 30 million euro investment to retain him.’",
      "Therefore a ‘warning is launched’ to Rashford and Man Utd, who could do with the money from a permanent transfer, and a ‘clear message has already been sent to the striker’s entourage’.",
      "The report in Spain continued: ‘At Barça, they aren’t content with isolated flashes; they’re looking for continuity, commitment in pressing, and the ability to make a difference in big matches.’",
      "According to reports, there are ‘alarm bells’ at FC Barcelona over Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford as they fear he is the ‘new Joao Felix’.",
      "After Rashford said Manchester United were stuck in a transition, Neville has replied telling him he had 10 years to help change that.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has hit out at the transfer policy at Old Trafford with the direction of the club “always changing”.",
      "According to reports, three Barcelona stars are ‘genuinely upset’ at Marcus Rashford’s transfer as he is to ‘trigger’ three summer exits.",

      "Arsenal have been leapfrogged in the Premier League prize money table by Liverpool and a rather less likely contender for the finance crown.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",
      "=1st) Liverpool and Nottingham Forest (8 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £6.64m in 2024/25",

      "=20th) Sunderland (2 games) – worth around £1.66m",

      "Matches in November – by September 17\nMatches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Piero Hincapie has ‘agreed’ terms with Arsenal as the Gunners eye TWO more signings, while three Manchester United deals are close…",

      "Florian Wirtz is the most expensive attacking midfielder in history by an absurd margin but Eberechi Eze has helped Arsenal crack the top five too.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – £100m/€116m (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool, June 2025)\nAs statements of intent from defending champions go, it’s a chunky one as Liverpool add the most expensive AM in history to a squad that cruised to Premier League glory last season.",
      "",
      "2) James Rodriguez – £63.2m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, July 2014)\nNever before has a shop window been so successfully deployed as when Rodriguez and his giant pet grasshopper dominated the 2014 World Cup so thoroughly that Real Madrid couldn’t help but make the Colombian the fourth most expensive footballer ever at the time. His next permanent club being Everton remains hilarious.",
      "",
      "3) Thomas Lemar – £63m/€70m (Monaco to Atletico Madrid, June 2018)\nWith failed club-record bids from Arsenal and Liverpool in his back pocket, Lemar took his eternal search for justice to Spain and Diego Simeone has not let him go since.",
      "",
      "4) Dominik Szoboszlai – £60m/€69.8m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2023)\nNeeding to remodel their entire midfield, Liverpool first signed Alexis Mac Allister at an apparent knockdown price before mulling over the release clause of Szoboszlai and pulling ahead of Newcastle to trigger it before expiration.",
      "",
      "5) Eberechi Eze – £60m/€69.4m (Crystal Palace to Arsenal, August 2025)\nAn injury to Kai Havertz on the opening weekend perhaps swayed Arsenal, who were among those happy to let Eze’s £68m release clause expire with the intention of possibly agreeing more favourable terms. The Gunners would be happy to pay £7.5m in add-ons if they are linked to trophies and such.",
      "",
      "6) Kaka – £56m/€65m (AC Milan to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nThe world’s costliest signing of all time – at least for a couple of weeks. After a planned £91m move to Manchester City on £500,000-a-week wages collapsed the previous January, Kaka went for a slightly more modest fee and delivered even less flashy numbers: 29 goals, 39 assists, 120 appearances and two trophies in four years before heading back to the Rossoneri on a free.",
      "",
      "7) Bruno Fernandes – £55.6m/€65m (Sporting to Man Utd, January 2020)\nAdd-ons have already far surpassed the initial £46.6m fee, with Sporting potentially due another £12.7m if Fernandes wins the PFA Player of the Year award or makes the Ballon d’Or top three. Manchester United could have doubled their money but knew they couldn’t afford the risk.",
      "",
      "8) Mason Mount – £55m/€64.2m (Chelsea to Man Utd, July 2023)\nA year from free agency and yet Manchester United’s desperation led them to pay a fair whack for the England international and Champions League winner. He has shown little since.",
      "",
      "9) Oscar – £52m/€60m (Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG, January 2017)\n“Every football player, or every person who works, wants to earn money to help their families. I came from a social background in Brazil that is very poor. We didn’t have anything. This is the fruit of my work and when I earn this, it is because I conquered it. The same way I came here, I will be able to return to Europe.” Fair play, although that continental comeback will probably never materialise now he’s back in Brazil.",
      "",
      "10) Dani Olmo – £51m/€60m (Leipzig to Barcelona, August 2024)\nThere have been registration issues owing to his new club’s continued financial difficulties but when Olmo has been able to play he has contributed healthily, with 12 goals and seven assists in a disrupted debut season.",
      "",
      "11) Otavio – £50.5m/€60m (Porto to Al-Nassr, August 2023)\nA star of the Saudi Arabia summer transfer window that was, Otavio has fared well enough but rumours persist over a return to Europe.",
      "",
      "12) Zinedine Zidane – £46.6m/€76m (Juventus to Real Madrid, July 2001)\nWith Spurs presumably unwilling to let Tim Sherwood go, Real Madrid had to settle for second best and a man absolutely dripping in Galactico rizz.",
      "",
      "13) Teun Koopmeiners – £46.1m/€54.7m (Atalanta to Juventus, August 2024)\nShortly after being crowned a Europa League winner, Koopmeiners made the move one place up the Serie A table to accompany The Old Lady on their continued hopeful journey towards relevance.",
      "",
      "14) Gylfi Sigurdsson – £45m/€53m (Swansea to Everton, August 2017)\nPart of the single greatest season of Premier League club-specific signings, with Everton also bringing in Davy Klaassen (£23.6m), Henry Onyekuru (£6.8m), Sandro Ramirez (£5.2m), Jordan Pickford (£30m), Michael Keane (£25m), Wayne Rooney (free), Nikola Vlasic (£8m), Cenk Tosun (£27.5m) and Theo Walcott (£20m).",
      "",
      "15) Bernardo Silva – £43m/€50m (Monaco to Manchester City, May 2017)\nThe Portuguese has tried to leave almost every summer since but 14 trophies and more appearances under Pep Guardiola than any other player ever has been a fair consolation prize.",
      "",
      "16) Cole Palmer – £42.5m/€50.4m (Manchester City to Chelsea, September 2023)\nIt seemed like a ridiculous move at the time but was until recently the one unqualified transfer success of this Chelsea regime. Forty goals, 27 assist, 91 appearances and an eternal contract is fine business.",
      "",
      "17) Mesut Ozil – £42.4m/€50m (Real Madrid to Arsenal, September 2013)\nPoor Geraint Hughes must still be having flashbacks after being encompassed by giddy Arsenal fans celebrating the quite unfathomable capture of a Real Madrid star at his peak. Everyone knows how that five-year contract and three-year extension in 2018 played out eventually but there were moments of absolute brilliance first.",
      "",
      "18) Xavi Simons – £42.1m/€50m (Paris Saint-Germain to Leipzig, January 2025)\nAfter a pair of successful loans it was decided that selling club Leipzig would indulge in a spot of record-breaking buying, making Simons the most expensive player in their history by a mile.",
      "",
      "19) James Maddison – £40m/€46.3m (Leicester to Tottenham, June 2023)\nAt one stage the most expensive Premier League signing from a relegated club, Maddison would be fortunate to emulate a former holder of that title in Moussa Sissoko.",
      "",
      "20) Joelinton – £40m/€45m (Hoffenheim to Newcastle, July 2019)\nDoes he belong on the list of most expensive midfielders, forwards or strikers instead? Genuinely not sure. But Eddie Howe has treasured and transformed Steve Bruce’s trash in so very many ways."

      "Kepa retains that mantle seven years on, despite spending much of the intervening time not even his own club’s best shot-stopper, nor even at his own club.",
      "Chelsea continue to stumble and muddle through imperfect goalkeeping solutions despite otherwise spending literal billions assembling their squad, with Kepa deemed entirely surplus to requirements and ready to board the Arsenal train for a fair whack less than Chelsea paid.",

      "CB: Harry Maguire (Leicester to Manchester United, £80m)\nAnother whose stock has fluctuated wildly between most expensive player ever in his position and saviour of the future, to poster boy for financial incompetence, Maguire is on his latest successful quest to win over a manager who tried to phase him out.",
      "For his myriad faults and foibles, the England centre-half is as committed to the cause as they come and, as Ruben Amorim has taken barely any time to discover, can be useful if chucked up front while chasing a late goal.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United definitely just tried to copy Liverpool’s homework but missed most of the working out, figuring that simply spending a world-record sum on a defender makes them an unbeatable leader of men for the best part of the next decade.",
      "But across six years at Old Trafford, Maguire has given far more to the club than he has taken away. And if that sounds like a remarkably low bar for an £80m signing, he’s one of a handful who can say the same in that same timeframe.",
      "",
      "CB: Josko Gvardiol (Leipzig to Manchester City, £77m)\nThe Premier League always seemed to beckon for Gvardiol. Leeds almost signed the Croatian in the season after their top-flight promotion, while the centre-half publicly discussed his dream of playing for Liverpool for years.",
      "Try as they might, Chelsea simply could not extract Gvardiol from Leipzig in summer 2022, when Boehly was throwing money in every direction.",
      "A £77.4m bid was not enough to persuade Leipzig to sell then, but Manchester City found their breakthrough with a similar figure 12 months later.",
      "Gvardiol might not take immense pride in being named the club’s Player of the Season in what was a trophyless and often quite miserable campaign, but he has already collected a few winner’s medals in a brief spell at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "CB: Virgil van Dijk (Southampton to Liverpool, £75m)\nBefore Liverpool signed Van Dijk on New Year’s Day 2018, the most expensive centre-half in history was David Luiz (£50m), the great man removing new teammate Thiago Silva (£32m) from that particular throne in 2014.",
      "One further step back from Paris Saint-Germain’s Brazilian connection takes the lineage of the world’s most expensive central defender all the way back to Rio Ferdinand, who joined Manchester United for £30m in 2002.",
      "The obvious importance of the position was appreciated, but not in transfer fee terms until Van Dijk. Liverpool laying £75m down on the Dutchman seemed to break the dam: there have been ten different moves worth at least £50m involving centre-halves in the subsequent seven-and-a-half years.",
      "Each have been chasing that transformative impact Van Dijk had on Liverpool, turning them from exciting but porous entertainers into stable, brilliant winners. They reached consecutive Champions League finals upon his arrival and dropped just 32 points in his first two full Premier League campaigns.",
      "The Dutchman has won the lot at Anfield, not missing a single minute of a title win and being named PFA Player of the Year in 2019, once again blazing a trail as the first defensive holder of that honour in 15 years.",
      "Even now, with the 33-year-old slowing down and past his imperious, perhaps peerless physical peak, there are few better overall. The sums were astronomical but pound-for-pound, Liverpool have rarely spent more wisely.",

      "Ten Hag vouched for and personally requested the purchase of his former Ajax colleague, which was a pitfall the Dutchman kept walking into until he was sacked.",
      "Antony never has lacked the appropriate work ethic and his attitude has rarely been in question either, but a lack of pace and general one-dimensional style did not translate at all well to the Premier League beyond the first few weeks.",
      "The years since his arrival have been defined by those involved in his signing trying their utmost to absolve themselves of blame. Antony has scored or assisted a goal every 319 minutes at Manchester United, compared to one every 152 minutes during that prodigious loan at Real Betis which has nevertheless not done quite enough to inflate his value to a point Old Trafford executives can sell without dying of PSR-related shame.",

      "CM: Moises Caicedo (Brighton to Chelsea, £100m)\nFor about £4.5m, Brighton signed Caicedo from Independiente del Valle on deadline day of the 2021 winter transfer window. Two and a half years and 53 appearances for the Seagulls later, the midfielder was sold for a potential Premier League record fee thanks to some elite-level desperation.",

      "“You only ever get one career and I really believe in what Mikel is building here and the squad he’s building,” a giddy Declan Rice told his new employers. “I’m really looking forward to the future with Arsenal.”",
      "If informed then that he would score two free-kicks in a Champions League quarter-final win over Real Madrid, he might have imagined that future to involve trophies.

Beyond that time they scored a goal and the other time they scored a different goal, a whole wedge of money was spent to become an entire bunch of awful.",
      "The most silver lining to that dark Stamford Bridge cloud likely benefited from not being tainted by any of the nonsense for too long. Fernandez completed his remarkable seven-month rise in the winter, from €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June to a British record transfer as a World Cup winner in January.",

While Miguel Almiron caught some stray bullets from Grealish as the Manchester City winger was being a “moron” during the club’s Premier League title celebrations in 2022, the #antics of a Treble-winning national treasure were enjoyed heartily in 2023.",
      "Then came the spiral. Grealish did not score a single Manchester City goal in 2024 and has been ostracised to the extent that 2025 will involve either joining a new club or signing up for months of training with the reserves.",

      "Moving from the Bundesliga to the Premier League can be too big a jump for some, but in recent years more players have adapted well, including Omar Marmoush and an improved Dominik Szoboszlai. Put it this way: Wirtz will hope to be more like Erling Haaland or Heung-min Son than Jadon Sancho – who he replaces in this XI – or Jean-Kevin Augustin.",
      "Wirtz is absolutely good enough to justify his huge transfer fee, but that kind of money can weigh heavy on some players. We’re excited to see which way he goes.",

      "CF: Romelu Lukaku (Inter Milan to Chelsea, £97.5m)\nWork has rarely if ever been quite as unfinished as the papers Lukaku opened again in 2021, a decade after his first Chelsea move. And the pile only stacked up further, so disastrous was his second spell at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The problem a teenage Lukaku encountered and suffered from at Chelsea was a lack of opportunities. He made 15 appearances for the club during the 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons, playing at least twice as often on separate loans with West Brom and Everton, before being permanently sold to the latter.",
      "The issue an experienced Lukaku faced on his Blues comeback was perhaps a little more complex. The Belgian was signed to play a role he has never particularly suited, and his yearning for the comforting embrace and mutual appreciation of Inter bore itself out in an unseemly interview saga, after Lukaku publicly discussed his unhappiness while criticising Thomas Tuchel’s tactics.",
      "That was the end of the road. Chelsea made £14.9m in loan fees from Inter and Roma before shipping Lukaku off to £30m; the Belgian has reached a Champions League final, Europa League semi-final and Serie A title glory in those spells.",

      "Arsenal pair Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke have joined the legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Alexander Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "28) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "27) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "26) Noni Madueke – £48.5m rising to £52m (Chelsea to Arsenal, July 2025)\nA section of the most ‘entitled’ fanbase in the world ought to have been ashamed at how they rallied against Arsenal’s latest signing of a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "While neither the striker Arsenal need nor the Rodrygo-level wide forward they wanted, Madueke will provide the sort of attacking cover which was painfully lacking in their latest failed title charge.",
      "",
      "25) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "24) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "23) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "22) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "21) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "20) Anthony Elanga – £52m rising to £55m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, July 2025)\nA £15m signing from Manchester United became a potential £55m sale to Newcastle within two years for Nottingham Forest, who could not resist that sweet profit when Eddie Howe kept loitering around the City Ground car park waiting for Elanga.",
      "",
      "19) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "18) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "17) Mohammed Kudus – £55m (West Ham to Spurs, July 2025)\nThe first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker was identified by Thomas Frank as a priority signing – and a sale the Hammers needed to make before they could embark on their own squad renovations.",
      "West Ham selling a player to a bitter rival for £25m under their reported release clause is fairly damning of Kudus but he will console himself with Champions League football.",
      "",
      "16) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "15) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "14) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "13) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "12) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "11) Eberechi Eze – £60m rising to £67.5m (Crystal Palace to Arsenal, August 2025)\nWhile he will hope to emulate Thierry Henry, having looked up to the Frenchman as an Arsenal academy graduate until his release as a 13-year-old in 2011, Eze has already endeared himself to the fanbase by following in the footsteps of Emmanuel Petit and leading Spurs on.",
      "That long road back to the Emirates opened up when Eze made a personal call to Mikel Arteta before fully committing to their bitter rivals, wanting to confirm that boyhood club Arsenal was not an option.",
      "It prompted a quick and straightforward hijack from Arsenal for a versatile forward who they feel can diversify their attack.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "9) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – £65m rising to £71m (Brentford to Manchester United, July 2025)\nIn a landmark summer for Premier League clubs overpaying for overperforming forwards within the division, Mbeumo was always likely to lead the pack after six excellent seasons with Brentford culminated in a 20-goal campaign.",
      "Newcastle withdrawing from the race when the Frenchman made his preference to move to Old Trafford clear should theoretically have made a deal easier and perhaps less expensive to strike. But no.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who was eventually turned into glue after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "Premier League clubs (excluding Fulham) have used the transfer window to upgrade certain positions, but who are the 10 biggest upgrades?",
      "Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish stole the show as Everton won their first game at the Hill Dickinson Stadium against hugely wasteful Brighton.",
      "Arsenal won at Manchester United and there were ’emotional reactions’ all over the shop, not most from Declan Rice.",
      "Liverpool are required to break the British transfer record to sign Alexander Isak this summer but he would be ninth on a list adjusted for football inflation.",
      "Man City are reportedly lining up a bid for a new winger after Fabrizio Romano gave Jack Grealish’s move to Everton his ‘here we go’ confirmation.",
      "Manchester City paid a record fee for Jack Grealish before squashing his individuality due to fear. Everton can take advantage and harness the maverick."

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and after the second weekend, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "10) Richarlison (2)\nYou would have got incredibly long odds on Richarlison winning the Golden Boot two weeks before the season but he has been immense so far, scoring twice in that simple opening win over Burnley and then impressing again as Spurs won at Manchester City. He will take some shifting from that starting XI by Dominic Solanke.",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "8=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "5=) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (2)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres, but it’s all evened out as players have caught up with the Norwegian.",
      "Liverpool legend Mo Salah has broken record after record, adding another with an assist against Newcastle. Here are his best stats from a brilliant career.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",

      "The forward had a trial with Manchester City and counted Arsenal among his numerous suitors, having made his debut – and scored – at just 15. Frankfurt actually tried to bring him in as Omar Marmoush’s replacement in January.",
      "",
      "Geovany Quenda (Sporting to Chelsea, £42.1m, June 2026)\nManchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",
      "",
      "Denner Evangelista (Corinthians to Chelsea, £11.5m, June 2026)\nThe cousin of Arsenal centre-half Gabriel, attacking left-back Denner will join him in London some time after his 18th birthday next February.",
      "Chelsea swooped in despite the Brazil youth international star having not yet made his senior debut for Corinthians.",
      "Of course there is a seven-year contract, add-ons and a sell-on clause.",
      "",
      "Modou Keba Cisse (LASK to Aston Villa, £4.3m, July 2026)\nThe latest in a lengthening line of young defenders signed from across Europe, teenage centre-half Cisse will spend one more season in Austria before joining up with Villa ahead of next season.",
      "“This marks a major step in my career, but I know the real work starts now,” Cisse said. “The Premier League is a dream – not every player gets this opportunity.”",
      "Playing alongside John McGinn remains a tantalising prospect for most professionals.",
      "",
      "Dastan Satpaev (Kairat Almaty to Chelsea, £3.3m, August 2026)\nIt is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",
      "",
      "Victor Ozhianvuna (Shamrock Rovers to Arsenal, £1.73m, January 2027)\nArsenal were linked with future Spurs signing Melia as part of their drive to become a landing spot for Ireland’s best young talents. They lost out in that race but managed to secure a pre-contract deal with Ohzianvuna.",
      "Club Brugge offered an immediate exit and path to the first team while Arsenal cannot bring the versatile midfielder in until after he turns 18 in January 2027, but all parties felt another year or so developing in Ireland before moving would be beneficial.",
      "Ozhianvuna will join on a four-and-a-half-year contract with add-ons which could double the initial fee and a sell-on clause, having caught Arsenal’s eye during a 2023 summer tournament staged at the club’s academy, while impressing in some LOI cameos and even the Conference League.",
      "",
      "Sidy Barhama Ndiaye (Diambars FC to Liverpool, £1m, January 2028)\nWhile Rio Ngumoha is all the rage now, the 16-year-old will be practically over the hill and retired soon enough and there is a perennial need to source the next prodigy.",
      "Ndiaye is over a year younger and recently caught the eye at the U17 AFCON, featuring in every game for a Senegal side knocked out on penalties in the quarters.",
      "Liverpool quickly moved to secure the future of a boy predictably dubbed ‘the next Mane’, who spent time training with the club this summer and even made a couple of impressive appearances for the U18s.",
      "A forward who can play on either side, Ndiaye is ineligible to join until after his 18th birthday. That is, ludicrously enough, not for another two years and four months.",

      "10) Alexander Isak (Newcastle United)\nA shortlisted player from the 2024/25 season, the Swede is currently in a stand-off at Newcastle as he pushes for a Liverpool transfer. He will have to either eat humble pie in the north east or hit the ground like a demon at Liverpool to win this award.",

      "",
      "1=) Bukayo Saka (Arsenal)\nA curious one this but worth noting that he was an early favourite in the 24/25 betting before he got injured. Maybe everybody thinks he is due a trophy. He was poor against Manchester United in the opening game and then got injured again v Leeds United.",
      "",
      "1=) Mo Salah (Liverpool)\nThe now three-time winner of the PFA award is up there again in the betting, though we have a sneaky feeling this will be an After The Lord Mayor’s Show of a season from the Egyptian.",

      "Man Utd will reportedly ‘agree two deals within days’ after Altay Bayindir continued to keep his place in net for the Red Devils against Fulham.",
      "The Red Devils have had a poor start to the new season with Ruben Amorim’s side losing to Arsenal in the opening weekend before being held to a draw against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "It is not the start Amorim would have wanted after the Man Utd board decided to put their faith in him this season despite a 15th-placed finish last term.",
      "Andre Onana failed to impress in goal last season as he made a number of glaring errors and Bayindir has started both of the Red Devils’ first two matches this campaign.",
      "But Man Utd legend Gary Neville was not happy with what he saw from the Turkey international, who was at fault for Arsenal’s goal at Old Trafford last weekend, when Bayindir flapped at a Fulham corner but Rodrigo Muniz could not take advantage.",
      "READ: Mailbox: Man Utd fans are ‘deluded’ or trying to win ‘I told you so’ trophy",
      "After his side’s draw at Craven Cottage, Man Utd boss Amorim told reporters: “I am focused on our goalkeepers. Like every manager I look at the amount of training, what I see in pre-season, in the games and try to decide who is the best goalkeeper to use in a game and I am going to continue to do that.”",
      "“You can look at it both sides,” he said when asked about Bayindir being targeted at corners. “We have a goal with a goal kick, we have two situations where we could manage to score, a penalty and the corner kick. In every game in the Premier League, you will always have situations in the corners.”",
      "And now Football Insider claims that Man Utd are ‘to agree two goalkeeper deals within days’ after their disappointing result against Fulham.",
      "Man Utd ‘will sell one of their current goalkeepers in the next few days’ while Senne Lammens is ‘expected to join’ from Belgian side Antwerp before the deadline.",
      "Football Insider adds: ‘Both Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir are at risk, with Tom Heaton likely to stay at Old Trafford as the third-choice option.",
      "‘Sources say that Lammens is coming in as a long-term project for the Red Devils, to provide competition and back up for the number one keeper.’",
      "Fabrizio Romano brought the latest on Lammens on his YouTube channel overnight, the transfer expert said: “Manchester United remain focused on the opportunity to bring in a new goalkeeper before the end of the window.",
      "“The player they want is Senne Lammens at Royal Antwerp. My understanding remains that the player is keen on a move to Manchester United, contacts took place again on Saturday with Manchester United and Antwerp. The two clubs are talking, at the moment, not yet a done deal but advancing.",
      "“The agreement with the player is okay, club to club negotiating. They started at €17 million plus €3m in add ons. Now Antwerp are asking for something close to €25m. So there is negotiations ongoing on the transfer fee and the details of the deal. Conversations are ongoing for Senne Lammens to go to Manchester United.",
      "“Let me explain again, that Lammens to Man United doesn’t mean that Andre Onana is leaving because he remains an important player for United and there are no concrete negotiations taking place. At the moment the situation has not changed.”",
      "Man United are closing in on their sixth summer signing and are ‘very optimistic’ the deal will be completed ‘in the next two days’, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have decided to ‘accelerate’ for their ‘clear priority’ as Ruben Amorim is ‘raging’ at one Red Devils star.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United face missing out on a top transfer target as a European giant have ‘submitted’ a hijack ‘offer’ at the last-minute.",
      "Former Man Utd defender Gary Neville reckons Andre Onana could ask to leave the Red Devils with Senne Lammens edging towards a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd are ‘actively work hard’ to find a new club for their goalkeeper with their fifth summer signing ‘almost done’.",
      "A Man Utd star has been ‘offered’ to Bayern Munich as Romano reveals a top Red Devils target has ‘said yes’ to the move to Old Trafford."

      "Monday 25 August 2025 15:37, UK",
      "Manchester United's performance in their 1-1 draw with Fulham dampened optimism around the side and underlined the need for midfield reinforcements, according to Gary Neville.",
      "Emile Smith Rowe's equaliser in a dramatic game at Craven Cottage cancelled out a contentious own goal by Rodrigo Muniz as Manchester United's wait for a first Premier League win of the season continued following last weekend's 1-0 loss to Arsenal.",
      "Ruben Amorim persisted with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as his central pairing, with the latter missing a first-half penalty as Kobbie Mainoo remained an unused substitute.",
      "\"[My optimism] has been checked slightly because it felt like there were a couple of the old scars reappearing and opening up,\" Neville said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"I think the goalkeeper is still looking very shaky on those crosses from corners, which can't continue because that anxiety builds, and then in central midfield I think United have to do a piece of business now.",
      "\"I would have liked to have thought that Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Ruben Amorim is not having him.",
      "\"He starts with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, he then puts Mason Mount back in there and then he brings [Manuel] Ugarte on in front of him, which tells you he's fourth-choice really.",
      "\"That means that they are going to need to get something sorted because it's going to be a problem.",
      "\"The two in there do get exposed when that front three are just a little bit higher and that back five get pushed back a bit.",
      "\"Those gaps, those acres of space seem to open up, and I thought United got cut through quite a few times in the second half.",
      "\"I think Bruno Fernandes is part of that in there and he [Amorim] is going to have to sort it out.\"",
      "For the second week in a row, Neville felt Manchester United's performance worsened with Amorim's substitutions, one of which saw Benjamin Sesko thrown on early in the second half.",
      "The Slovenia international, a £73.7m signing from RB Leipzig who also appeared from the bench against Arsenal, was unable to make an impact as Manchester United struggled to find attacking momentum.",
      "\"I said this last week and it's a little bit worrying: Fulham got a lot stronger when they made their substitutions, I actually thought United got worse when they made theirs,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Sesko, at the moment, let's just say it, he's nowhere near in terms of fitness or just getting up to speed.\"",
      "Neville feels the striker will need to be given more minutes to build his fitness, starting in Wednesday's Carabao Cup second-round tie away to Grimbsy Town.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim said before the game that there is a clamour to play him,\" said Neville. \"Last week, I was saying, 'look, let's just get him straight in'.",
      "\"He is going to have to get him in against Grimsby and give him 90 minutes.",
      "\"He's going to have to probably play him against Burnley next Saturday, just to get him going, because you can see he needs football.",
      "\"What you can't do is let a player of that value, that potential, just keep being on the bench.",
      "\"The problem he'll have is that he wants to keep [building] the team, but I think what you saw when they brought Sesko on, put Mount into midfield and took Casemiro off, they did get opened up and it looked like Fulham could score.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes allowed his penalty to distract him during the game.",

      "Monday 25 August 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Calvin Bassey and Marco Silva both felt Manchester United's opener at Fulham should have been ruled out for a clear push by Leny Yoro in the build-up - on an afternoon of officiating controversy at Craven Cottage.",
      "In the pulsating 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage, Yoro appeared to have two hands in the back of Fulham defender Bassey as he met a United corner, before forcing a Rodrigo Muniz own goal. VAR Darren England approved the goal after a brief check.",
      "But Bassey felt referee Chris Kavanagh \"will be disappointed\" when they look back at the decision - especially as the Fulham defender was penalised for a shove on Mason Mount in the first half which gave United a penalty - that Bruno Fernandes missed.",
      "\"But come on, it's a foul. When you've got to jump, any little touch can put you off. He [Yoro] has got two hands [on my back]. How much worse do you need? On another day, it goes in our favour.",
      "\"It's enough for me not to win the ball and it's an advantage for him, so it should have been given.\"",
      "\"I cannot understand it. I would love to explain everything to you from the first whistle to the last. But I don't have this. It's not my job, I don't want to go in this direction for everything that went on this afternoon at Craven Cottage.\"",
      "Analysing the United goal on co-commentary duty, Gary Neville said: \"If I was Fulham, I would be asking about the two hands in Bassey's back.",
      "\"Both hands on the back and Yoro is lucky to get away with that, but he will not care.\"",
      "Bassey was also at the centre of VAR controversy as he was accused by the officials of bringing down Mount in the penalty area.",
      "As per PGMOL guidance, referees will award more penalties for holding this season - in an attempt to crack down on grappling at set-pieces.",
      "Referee Kavanagh did not award the shove on Mount in real time but - two minutes after the incident, the official was sent to the VAR monitor during the next available break in play.",
      "\"I still think it's harsh,\" said Bassey about the incident. \"I understand why it's given. I'm trying to stay strong because I know the block's coming, and then I've pulled him over my foot.",
      "\"But the ref has got to protect us as well. I'm strong, so it looks a bit more aggressive. If it's someone stronger [than Mount], I don't think it looks as bad.",
      "\"It's hard. Sometimes, when you feel the contact early, you go down and the ref can give you a foul. When you're in the game and the ball's there to be won, sometimes you're trying to get to the ball as quickly as possible and you've got to get the man out the way.",
      "\"There's a fine line between giving a foul away and getting away with it. On another day, maybe the ref doesn't look at it. We as players just have to try to be clever.",
      "\"I tried to communicate with the ref because I knew the block was coming. I told him, on every corner, 'watch the blocks, watch the blocks', but he made his decision. It's something to learn, just be a bit more streetwise and smart with it.\"",
      "Asked if he was relieved at Fernandes then missing the penalty, Bassey replied: \"I'd say it was justice! I didn't think it was a pen. It was a bit of relief.\"",
      "There was even controversy as Fernandes stepped up to take the spot-kick, with the United captain colliding with referee Kavanagh in the build-up.",
      "Analysing the incident on co-commentary duty, Neville said: \"He picked the ball up, and maybe the referee has given him a bump by accident. And he goes back, it unnerved him a little bit.",
      "\"I thought it was because the referee was adjusting the players on the edge of the box, but [a few seconds later] he was still having a go at the referee, Fernandes - as he feels it was a little bit clumsy. That is maybe what put him off.\"",
      "\"It upset me because the referee didn't apologise. That is what triggered me in that moment but that's not the excuse for missing the penalty.",
      "\"I had a very bad hit on the ball. I put my foot too under the ball and that's why it ended up going over the bar.\"",
      "Asked for his take on the incident, United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he's not used to missing a penalty. He knows that every moment in this context can have a huge impact on the team.",
      "\"I felt that during the game he was not so happy, not so involved, because he had so much responsibility and he felt the missed penalty was huge for us.\"",

      "The winger picked up two assists in Everton's 2-0 win - as many as in the previous two seasons combined at Manchester City. Had Dwight McNeil converted a late chance, it would have been a hat-trick of assists for the first time since his Aston Villa days.",
      "\"I hope he has got more of them to come,\" said David Moyes afterwards, acknowledging that Grealish gives this Everton something different. \"The big thing is he ball-carried for us. He retained the ball for us as well which gave us a little bit more composure.\"",
      "It is no great surprise that Grealish showed good technique. The only question was how he would approach this challenge after the disappointment of finding himself surplus to requirements at City. But he showed that he had the stomach for the fight too.",
      "He was tracking back inside two minutes. Putting in a tackle inside his own box just after the hour. \"He was game for it, didn't try to shirk anything, didn't want off after 60 minutes, didn't want any of that,\" said Moyes. \"No chance, he wants to show that he's the real deal.",
      "\"You know, you admire somebody who's saying, he probably has something to prove. I had something to prove, I think, over the years at different times. Sometimes it gives you that challenge that you have to try and be ready to take. Hopefully, Jack is.\"Adam Bate",

After a debut goal against Brentford and an assist against Palace, he became the first Nottingham Forest player to score or assist in both of his first two Premier League games for the club since 1998.",
      "Elanga's attributes were clear and Ndoye perhaps doesn't possess the blistering speed that Newcastle's summer signing has.",
      "However, Ndoye's adaptability will impress Nuno, who can continue to hope for an interchanging and dynamic forward line.",
      "Ndoye's first-half display saw him marshalled out of the game. However, all it took was a tweak from Nuno to switch him and Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ndoye's individual brilliance did the rest to carve out the assist that earned Forest a point.",

      "Within the whirlwind that Crystal Palace have caught themselves up in this summer, it's been too easy to forget the fine work that is still being accomplished at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace continued an unbeaten start to the season.",
      "Whether it's the demotion to the Conference League or Palace's biggest stars being linked and in Eberechi Eze's case, securing a move away, the Eagles have navigated a strong start to the season. Their four games unbeaten are reflective of the mentality Glasner has developed in SE25.",
      "A win in the Community Shield saw Palace fight back to take Premier League Champions Liverpool to penalties. Their opening league fixture at Chelsea saw them controversially denied a point at the home of the world champions.",
      "A first game in Europe followed with Eze's future an acceptable distraction but still Palace secured victory. Against Forest, Palace will feel they dropped two points against a side that scored with their only shot on target. But Oliver Glasner will see the positives in their display.",
