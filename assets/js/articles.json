      "Manchester United have completed the signing of Matheus Cunha. United will pay Wolves £62.5million for the Brazilian after triggering the release clause in his contract.",
      "Cunha becomes the Red Devils' first signing of a crucial summer transfer window, subject to his visa and registration. The Brazil star is now to head on international duty but was pictured in Manchester on Sunday morning.",
      "Upon announcing the deal, United said: \"Everyone at Manchester United looks forward to welcoming Matheus to Old Trafford.\"",
      "Cunha's former club meanwhile expressed their gratitude for the forward's time at the club. \"Everyone at Wolves would like to thank Matheus for his contributions in old gold and wish he and his family the best of luck for the future,\" a statement read.",
      "Amorim has prioritised boosting his attacking options this summer, following a dreadful campaign in front of goal. The Red Devils ended up as the fifth-lowest scorers in the top-flight, with Amorim struggling to unlock his side's attack. Cunha will come in as one of the two No.10s in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "The 26-year-old starred in Wolves' successful battle to beat relegation to the Championship. He scored 17 goals and add six assists to earn Wolves' Players' Player of the Season award.",
      "Cunha himself has already made his happiness at his move north clear. The attacker has hailed his new manager Amorim and backed him to succeed at United despite his difficult start.",
      "\"Talking about him is easy, I think he's a great coach and I wish him nothing but the best,\" Cunha told CNN Brasil via Daily Mail. \"I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal.\" Asked if they could do that together, he added: \"Well, God willing, we'll always do our best to help.\"",
      "According to The Athletic, United first offered to pay Cunha's release clause in five instalments. This suggestion was flatly rejected by Wolves, with the Red Devils now agreeing to meet the full terms of the Midlands club's demands.",
      "Cunha joined Wolves from RB Leipzig on loan in January 2023 before completing a permanent move for £43m that summer. He previously played for Atletico Madrid, Hertha Berlin and FC Sion, and has been capped 13 times by Brazil.",
      "The attacker will be with his new club for the start of pre-season training in July. The move for Cunha has already been backed by legendary United skipper Gary Neville.",
      "\"They need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's [Cunha] a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.\""

      "Despite the club missing out on a spot in the Champions League and the riches that come with that by losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final, chief executive Omar Berrada has insisted United are ready to back Ruben Amorim in the transfer market.",

      "Amorim also recently opened up about United's transfer plans while on the club's post-season tour, claiming that the team will improve over the summer. \"We always prepare two plans: one with Champions League, one without Champions League,\" he explained.",

      "\"It was the past, so can be the future. It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.",
      "\"It's important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.\"",

Rashford is one of several United players who are likely to leave the club in the upcoming transfer window after a successful loan spell at Aston Villa.",
      "Rashford netted four goals and assisted five during his stint under Unai Emery but it is unclear whether Villa will activate their £40million option to buy him permanently.",

      "Barcelona have since moved ahead of Villa as the most likely destination for Rashford, but according to German outlet Bild, the club do not want to pay the £40m fee.",
      "It claims that Rashford is eager to move to the Nou Camp after falling out with Ruben Amorim and manager Hansi Flick is interested in making the deal happen.",
      "But it adds that Barcelona don't want to sign him on a permanent transfer and are only keen on a loan move.",
      "It comes as a significant blow to Manchester United, who are in a difficult financial position and need to make money from outgoings if they are to spend this summer.",
      "Rashford joins the likes of Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Joshua Zirkzee who have been linked with an exit. Christian Eriksen, Jonny Evans and Viktor Lindelof have already left on free transfers.",

      "It is claimed United would give the thumbs up to loaning Rashford out one more time, but they would require Barcelona to cover his £325,000-a-week salary while also paying a loan fee of between £5m and £10m on top.",
      "The Red Devils would also want an obligation for Barcelona to buy Rashford in the summer of 2026 - though the club have also been linked with moves for Liverpol's Luis Diaz and Arsenal's Gabriel Martinelli, who they could turn to instead.",

      "Cunha’s path to the top began in 2017 when Eric Lovey spotted him playing for Brazilian side Coritiba’s youth team. Lovey, a former FIFA representative, was instrumental in the early career of Brazilian legend Ronaldinho serving as his confidante and agent and quickly became aware of Cunha’s potential.",

      "Hertha journalist Marc Schwitzky suggested a clash of styles between Cunha's \"free spirit\" approach and former Leipzig manager Julian Nagelsmann's tactical discipline may have hampered his success. \"Probably the move to Leipzig came a little too early for Cunha, who was just 19 years old at the time of the transfer,\" he penned.",
      "\"It is natural that settling into one of the best leagues in the world is difficult, especially for young players. In Cunha's case, however, there was also the fact that he wants to be an absolute free spirit on the field.",

      "After a season at Sampdoria, Fernandes returned to his homeland for Sporting, where he thrived before United came calling. He has comfortably been the Red Devils’ best performer since then, winning their Player of the Season award four times, including this campaign.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs are understood to be relaxed about his current situation, wanting to keep their talisman while still being prepared to entertain bids for any player. The club's failure to secure Champions League football by losing the Europa League final has only heightened their need to sell players in order to rebuild the squad while still complying with Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules.",

      "With the Premier League season now over, clubs have already begun plotting their moves for the summer transfer window. While there are always many different plots unfolding at the same time, few will have as much focus as the situation around Marcus Rashford.",
      "The 27-year-old spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Aston Villa after being banished to the Manchester United wilderness by Ruben Amorim. Overall, the United academy graduate made a good impression at Villa Park, contributing four goals and six assists across all competitions, which earned him a recall to the England squad.",
      "The forward's next chapter is currently unknown, but with Amorim showing no signs that he has changed his stance, it is expected the Old Trafford exit door will be propped open for Rashford.",
      "In 17 appearances in all competitions, of which 10 were as a starter, Rashford contributed four goals and six assists. He made a variety of vital contributions, including his brace of assists in Villa's 2-1 victory over Chelsea as well as his impressive display against Paris Saint-Germain, when the Midlanders were so close to overturning a 3-1 aggregate deficit in the Champions League quarter-final.",
      "Under Emery, Rashford looked sharp, hungry, focussed and clinical. Villa fell just short of Champions League qualification, but Emery loves the Europa League and would want a squad that is good enough to battle in Europe and domestically.",
      "However, Villa already have the sixth-highest wage bill in the Premier League and may not be able to accommodate the £325,000-per-week Rashford is believed to be earning at United. From a football perspective, it looks to be a solid fit, but with a £40million buy option on top of a huge salary, the financial implications could be too steep for Villa.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur's dreadful Premier League campaign was overwritten by their Europa League triumph over United, which saw them qualify for the Champions League. The north Londoners' 17th-place Premier League finish was humiliating, but it's easy to forget the terrifying amount of injuries Spurs had to contend with.",
      "As well as losing key players like James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Dominic Solanke to injury, captain and talisman Son Heung-min also endured a tough campaign, as his tally of seven goals in 30 Premier League appearances was his lowest since his debut campaign in the 2015/16 season, when he only contributed four goals in 28 appearances. With the South Korean losing his edge in front of goal this season, another forward with pace, directness and a clinical edge may be on Ange Postecoglou's radar.",
      "Rashford could be the perfect fit for the Tottenham boss, especially with his vast Champions League experience. If Tottenham are able to negotiate a good transfer fee with United, who will surely need to sell some players after missing out on the prize money for qualifying for the Champions League, Rashford may be ideal for Spurs.",
      "Along with Liverpool forward Luis Diaz, Rashford was recently name-checked by Barcelona manager Hansi Flick as a player they admire. The German said: \"I don't want to speak about players which are not in my team, but of course Luis Diaz and Marcus Rashford are fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.”",
      "It's been widely reported that Rashford has ambitions of one day playing at the Nou Camp, but Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo recently claimed that the forward's representatives told Barcelona officials he would be willing to lower his wages, to try and earn a move to the La Liga giants.",
      "Barcelona have established themselves as European heavyweights once more, winning La Liga and reaching the Champions League semi-finals. However, with Raphinha, Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal leading the frontline, while Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres provide cover, Rashford may have to work hard to force his way into Flick's plans.",
      "If Barcelona make a serious proposal, it's likely Rashford would jump at the opportunity, but he would need to work harder and play better than he has ever before to dislodge the current stars in Catalunya.",
      "Scott McTominay took the bold decision to leave United and pursue pastures new at Napoli, and he was rewarded with a Serie A title and even a reception with the Pope.",
      "The Scot was a bit-part player at Old Trafford before Antonio Conte's side signed him for around £25.7m. Under the guidance of the ex-Chelsea manager, McTominay became an unstoppable goalscoring midfielder, contributing 12 goals and six assists in 34 appearances.",
      "How Rashford would relish the Conte treatment, which has also had a positive effect on another ex-United striker in Romelu Lukaku, who scored 14 goals and contributed 10 assists. Conte has demanded new signings, and with Napoli also being linked with Alejandro Garnacho in the past, it's possible Conte may prefer Rashford's experience and cutting edge.",
      "However, the biggest uncertainty is Conte's future, as Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis appeared to suggest the Italian could be leaving. He told Napoli fans at their open-top bus celebration: \"I wish Conte continuing success in his professional life. Thank you, Antonio.\"",
      "Rashford has also seen the likes of Tammy Abraham, Fikayo Tomori and Ruben Loftus-Cheek move to AC Milan and enjoy their football. A space could soon open up at the Rossoneri, as left-winger Rafael Leao currently has an uncertain future at the San Siro.",
      "Milan endured a difficult campaign this year, registering a disappointing eighth-place finish. New energy and a new attitude may be required to jumpstart the European giants, who won Serie A in 2022 and Rashford could be the one to provide that spark.",
      "Their lack of European football next season, though, may mean a move doesn't materialise, given the necessary funds involved.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The transfer window is now open and it looks set to be one of the busiest ever for Premier League clubs. Manchester United are expected to be very busy as they look to overhaul their squad this summer after a woeful campaign.",
      "The likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are all expected to be sold, while club captain Bruno Fernandes could also be on the move. Al-Hilal are hoping to bring him to Saudi Arabia, having offered Fernandes a £100m deal over three years - with another £100m transfer fee for United.",
      "Reigning champions Liverpool have already made some moves, with Trent Alexander-Arnold's move to Real Madrid confirmed on Friday with Madrid forking out around £8.4m to sign him a month early so he can play in the Club World Cup.",
      "The signing of his replacement Jeremie Frimpong was also confirmed on Friday, with Liverpool spending £29.5m on the Bayer Leverkusen star. Another Leverkusen player is also expected to make the move to Anfield, with Liverpool closing in on a deal to sign Florian Wirtz.",

      "Tudor secured Champions League football, but is not necessarily seen as their long-term fit.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Any plans Manchester United had to return for Jarrad Branthwaite this summer have been dealt a blow with Chelsea weighing up a move to sign the Everton. The 22-year-old has two years remaining on his contract and was the subject of interest from United last summer and the Red Devils were said to be interested in making another attempt in the coming months.",
      "The Red Devils saw two bids rejectedlast year, with their second reaching £50million but the Merseyside club were determined not to sell. And Toffees boss David Moyes remains reluctant to part ways with his young star, per Mail Online, despite the burgeoning interest.",
      "If United go head to head against Chelsea this summer however, they may not find much success. Branthwaite is reported to have wanted the offer of Champions League football to depart Merseyside and United are unable to offer any European football at all.",
      "Real Madrid are taking an interest in Arsenal star Myles Lewis-Skelly as the 18-year-old's contract runs into its final year. The teenager broke through into Arsenal's first team this season and made the full-back position his own on his way to making an England debut.",
      "But having signed his first professional deal in 2023, the teenager is now set to see his contract expire in 2026. Arsenal are now under pressure to come to terms on a new deal, with negotiations underway with the teenager.",
      "According to the Guardian however, it has not been a smooth process thus far and Real Madrid could look to take advantage. Los Blancos have made a habit of targeting out-of-contract stars and added Kylian Mbappe free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain a year ago before signing Trent Alexander-Arnold with little over a month remaining on his contract.",
      "Manchester United are holding internal discussions over their next move after missing out on Liam Delap, according to reports. The Ipswich Town forward is said to undergo a medical ahead of a move to Chelsea after the Blues persuaded him to come to Stamford Bridge after discussions with a number of clubs.",
      "Chelsea's offer of European football appears to have handed them the edge as United miss out on a player they are said to have been confident of securing a deal for. Nevertheless, the club already had alternatives in mind and are now set to move forward with their next move.",
      "Victor Osimhen, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jonathan David, and Randal Kolo Muani are among the names under consideration as the Red Devils attempt to sign a new forward to improve their strikeforce for Amorim.",
      "Arsenal have opened talks with RB Leipzig over a deal to sign Benjamin Sesko as the Gunners look to finally strengthen Mikel Arteta 's frontline. A new striker is said to be top of the shopping list, with Arsenal lacking a goalscorer despite the head coach's calls to sign one.",
      "‌According to a report from the Daily Mail, Arsenal's new sporting director Andrea Berta has held talks with Leipzig chief Marcel Schafer. And it has emerged that the Bundesliga side want an initial £75million fee for the 22-year-old, who scored 13 times last term.",
      "Kai Havertz was Arsenal's top scorer in the Premier League with just nine strikes. Only Manchester United and Southampton had a top scorer who netted fewer times.",
      "‌If they accepted the approach from the Saudi side, United would have the finances to meet Sporting’s £70m valuation of Gonclaves. And his arrival could perhaps go some way to easing the anger that Amorim would feel over losing his captain.",
      "Goncalves was transformed him into a lethal attacking midfielder who can also play out wide by Amorim in Portugal after spotting his potential for goals at a pre-season training camp in 2020. He was rewarded with 23 goals in 32 games as Sporting won the Portuguese title for the first time in 19 years, the following season.",
      "Manchester City will hold fresh talks with AC Milan over a £55m move for midfielder Tijjani Reijnders as Pep Guardiola looks to refresh his squad ahead of a renewed assault on all fronts next season.",
      "Netherlands international Reijnders has become one of Serie A’s highest-rated midfield players and City are keen to seal a deal early in the window, while the club retain a firm interest in Rayan Cherki, who is eager to move from Lyon.",
      "‌Kevin De Bruyne is unhappily leaving City and is fancied to join Napoli, while the futures of experienced figures Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva are unclear with Guardiola expected to revamp his midfield.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has a big decision to make – and whichever call he makes, he will likely have to abandon his previous plans. The Manchester United captain has been handed the opportunity of a mega-money move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, but is yet to make his mind up.",
      "Fernandes stands at a crossroads in his career following a dreadful campaign for United which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose the Europa League final. After a miserable and embarrassing post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong, he now has to decide whether to stick by United, or cash in with a move to Al-Hilal.",
      "The Saudi club are reportedly willing to pay United £100million to sign the Portugal international, who they will then pay £100m over the course of his contract. His agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with the club’s executives this week and he reportedly has a week to decide, with Al-Hilal preparing for the Club World Cup.",
      "‌Amid the storm, Fernandes has stirred the pot by posting a Portuguese quote on Instagram which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "Everton are ready to sound out Manchester City about the possibility of taking John Stones back to the Merseyside club.",
      "Stones, who has been a pivotal figure under Pep Guardiola, has been plagued by injuries for the last two seasons and hasn’t played since undergoing an operation to repair a hamstring tear he sustained in February.",
      "City signed young centre-backs Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Juma Bah in January and are also big admirers of Toffees star Jarrad Branthwaite. Stones has just a year left on his £250,000-a-week contract and would have to take a pay-cut to link up again with David Moyes.",
      "But City’s asking price is unlikely to be prohibitive and they are aware that the defender needs regular football to push for a place in England’s World Cup squad next summer.",
      "Liverpool have made an improved bid for Florian Wirtz which is closer to Bayer Leverkusen's £126million valuation. Wirtz, 22, is expected to sign a five-year contract at Anfield if the Reds strike a deal, as the Leverkusen star has already rejected Bayern Munich.",
      "It's understood that Liverpool lodged an opening bid of £85m earlier this week. Now, after seeing that deal turned down, they've moved again, with an offer worth a total £109m.",
      "This could be enough to tempt Leverkusen into a sale, with the Bundesliga club previously demanding £126m during talks with Bayern. But given that Liverpool are a foreign club, his asking price could be reduced. Wirtz wouldn't be the only Leverkusen player heading to Anfield, as the Reds have agreed to pay right-back Jeremie Frimpong's £29.5m release clause.",
      "Bayern chiefs appear to have accepted that Wirtz has chosen to join Premier League champions Liverpool, whose officials with the Germany international and his parents near Blackpool last week. Liverpool's pitch impressed the Wirtz clan, who've given the green-light for a move to Merseyside after making his name in the Bundesliga.",
      "The 2025 summer transfer window is open and it is set to get off to a flier with most of the Premier League ’s big guns expected to complete deals in the opening days.",
      "That is predominantly on account of the controversial new Club World Cup that sees Chelsea and Manchester City head to the United States next week for a financially-lucrative month of action that many players are unhappy to be a part of. But its consequences are extending into this summer’s recruitment as some clubs race to make signings so their new faces can compete.",
      "That includes Trent Alexander-Arnold signing for Real Madrid for £10m - despite being available for free at the end of the month. Equally several sides not competing in the CWC are getting active with Manchester United set to bring in Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and Liverpool wrapping up a deal for Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz potentially following right behind on the path from Leverkusen.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho looks destined for the Manchester United exit door after Ruben Amorim gave him his marching orders. It's set to be a sad end to what was hoped to be a hugely promising career at Old Trafford.",
      "The Argentine winger, 20, was tipped to follow in Cristiano Ronaldo's footsteps after breaking into the first team under Erik ten Hag. But he's fallen massively out of favour with Amorim, who is believed to have taken issue with his comments after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho described United's season as \"s***\" and bemoaned his benching after playing in every prior round. According to the Daily Mail, Amorim responded by singling him out at an end-of-season meeting last weekend, with the United boss alleged to have said: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\"",
      "That comment all but confirmed that his Red Devils stay is over. Garnacho is believed to be valued in the region of £60-70million, but there's no shortage of potential suitors lining up to end his United nightmare, with the window now open from June 1 to June 10 due to the Club World Cup.",
      "Having already had a £40m bid rejected in January, the newly-crowned Italian champions are favourites to secure the youngster's signature. He's a natural replacement for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, who departed Naples for PSG in the winter window.",
      "There's therefore no doubt that he could be a regular starter for Antonio Conte. And that's worked wonders for his former team-mate Scott McTominay, who's established himself as a club legend after just one season thanks to his goalscoring heroics.",
      "The i report that Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna is set to meet with United officials to re-open talks for Garnacho. Whether they can meet in the middle of their valuations remains to be seen.",
      "A club that may be more likely to stump up the desired cash is Chelsea. There are no signs that Todd Boehly's wallet won't be flying open this summer like it has done for the last three years.",
      "The Blues might well need to add an extra incentive to persuade INEOS to strengthen a Premier League rival – but there's always a price. As usual, Enzo Maresca doesn't necessarily need yet another attacking option in his ranks.",
      "The future of Jadon Sancho remains up in the air, though. And with Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto being more natural fits on the right wing, there could be room for Garnacho in the XI.",
      "A return to the club where he spent five years of his youth career looks like another potential next move for Garnacho. He left to pursue his \"dream\" in 2020.",
      "A lot has changed since then and Atletico boss Diego Simeone is believed to be a big fan of their former academy prospect. He does, however, appear a less natural fit in Simeone's favoured 4-4-2 formation.",
      "Both Alexander Sorloth and Julian Alvarez enjoyed stunning seasons up top, scoring 20 and 17 league goals respectively. So Garnacho would likely have to drop a touch deeper and put in the legwork that Amorim has often accused him of lacking.",
      "He could enjoy more attacking freedom at the San Siro. Both Inter and AC have been linked with a swoop, but an exit for Rafael Leao could put the latter in the driving seat.",
      "Leao has been linked with a whole host of clubs, including United. There could be a swap deal to be made if Garnacho fancies it.",
      "Milan have been named in reports in Italy as one of the early movers to enter negotiations, alongside Napoli. But their lack of European football next season puts them on the back foot.",
      "The appointment of Ten Hag at the BayArena has naturally sparked suggestions of a reunion for Garnacho in Germany. Leverkusen certainly won't be short of funds this summer.",
      "Liverpool activating Jeremie Frimpong's £29.5m release clause, as well as reportedly closing in on a £100m-plus deal for Florian Wirtz, leaves Ten Hag with a tidy war chest to attack the window with.",
      "Garnacho's profile lends itself to success in Germany, and he was productive under the Dutchman for United. But it's perhaps a riskier move with the club in a transitional period following Xabi Alonso's exit.",

      "Ruben Amorim's bid to make Manchester United play his way is facing an added complication because the club’s academy teams continue to use a tactical blueprint that doesn’t fit his philosophy.",
      "Amorim accepts that United are unable to spend their way back to the top after missing out on a £100million Champions League jackpot with defeat in the Europa League Final. And the Reds’ boss is ready to keep up the Old Trafford tradition of bringing through youngsters from United’s hugely-productive youth set-up during his rebuild after implementing a similar plan at Sporting Lisbon.",
      "But United’s academy teams are grounded to play a 4-3-3 system that Amorim has no faith in. And he feels the task of bedding young players into his senior squad is even tougher because of how they have spent their formative years.",
      "Old Trafford academy chiefs insist they continue to produce footballers with a skill-set to adapt to any tactical request - and Amorim has given first-team debuts this season to youngsters Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson. He also included the likes of Dan Armer, Jaydan Kamason, Godwill Kukonki, Tyler Fletcher, Sekou Kone, Shea Lacey, Jack Moorhouse and Jim Thwaites in United’s squad for a post-season tour of the Far East.",
      "But there is a disconnect between the way United’s age-group teams play and how Amorim sets up his senior side.",
      "The Reds’ boss remains wedded to a formation that employs a three-man defence and demands that wing-backs provide attacking width. It was a philosophy that worked for him when he was building a reputation as one of Europe’s best coaches at Braga and Sporting.",
      "And he refused steadfastly to adapt his beliefs despite inheriting a United squad that struggled badly to meet their manager’s demands from the moment he took charge in November.",
      "A source said: “Amorim made it clear when he spoke to United about becoming the coach that he needed the freedom to play the way he did in Portugal. Sporting, like United, have a reputation for developing their own talent and their academy also traditionally used 4-3-3.",
      "“But when Amorim became the coach there was also a shift towards 3-4-3 and 3-4-2-1 at youth level to mirror the first team.",
      "“If you look at how Sporting played in the UEFA Youth League this season, you will see that they played with all three formations.”",
      "Some of the problems Amorim inherited at Old Trafford mirror issues he dealt with ruthlessly when he became Sporting coach with 11 games of the 2019-20 season remaining. He immediately ditched the 4-2-3-1 formation employed by managerial predecessor Silas.",
      "Fans’ favourites like Marcos Acuna and Islam Slimani were sold after failing to buckle down to the new boss’ requirements in the same way that Amorim wants to move on Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "A new data-driven approach to recruitment saw players like Pedro Concalves, Pedro Porro, Joao Mario, Nuno Santos, Zouhair Feddal and Bruno Tabata arrive that summer to help implement his tactical requirements.",
      "And the emergence of Matheus Nunes, Eduardo Quaresma, Nuno Mendes, Joelson Fernandes and Tiago Tomas from the youth system helped Sporting become Portuguese champions for the first time in 19 years with just one defeat all season.",
      "Sporting lifted the Portuguese title again under Amorim last year - and have retained the trophy this season despite successor Joao Pereira lasting eight games and current coach Rui Borges opting to use 4-4-2. When Amorim left the club to move to Manchester, his team were averaging 65 percent possession during domestic games.",
      "The United boss spoke often during his tough introduction to life in Manchester about being given the backing of United's owners.",

      "The 2025 summer transfer window is open and it is set to get off to a flier with most of the Premier League ’s big guns expected to complete deals in the opening days.",
      "That is predominantly on account of the controversial new Club World Cup that sees Chelsea and Manchester City head to the United States next week for a financially-lucrative month of action that many players are unhappy to be a part of. But its consequences are extending into this summer’s recruitment as some clubs race to make signings so their new faces can compete.",
      "That includes Trent Alexander-Arnold signing for Real Madrid for £10m - despite being available for free at the end of the month. Equally several sides not competing in the CWC are getting active with Manchester United set to bring in Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m and Liverpool wrapping up a deal for Jeremie Frimpong, with Florian Wirtz potentially following right behind on the path from Leverkusen.",
      "Here are some of the big things to look out for in the first part of a two-segment window.",
      "The CWC is a driving factor but so too is the fact several of the big teams - believing they have a window to grab success after Liverpool ended City’s dominance - are active immediately.",
      "Another theory is that they are all keen on adding goalscorers and the pool is very small - hence why Liam Delap is such hot property and expected to join Chelsea.",
      "Last summer the window was three weeks old before one of the traditional big six confirmed a move - but we already know Frimpong will be made official on Sunday and United’s deal for Cunha could follow soon.",
      "A lull is guaranteed, however. Again as a consequence of the CWC, the window will shut on June 10 for six days before then running through to September 1’s deadline.",
      "The early flurry suggests a very quiet second half of June is in store.",
      "Frimpong has already posed with the Liverpool shirt and his team-mate at Leverkusen, Wirtz, is the subject of a £109m bid that massively goes against the grain of how the champions have operated in the market for years.",
      "Alexander-Arnold’s switch to Real will be confirmed at some point on Sunday and the £10m fee gained for letting him move a month early is handsome business.",
      "If it all looks like sunshine and rainbows at Liverpool, down the East Lancs Road it is mostly misery at Old Trafford. United may be closing a deal to sign Cunha but there are set to be a series of high-profile exits, including Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and, possibly, captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Saudi giants Al Hilal have given him another few days to decide whether to accept a bumper pay day worth up to £200m across three years. Serious consideration is being given but Al Hilal want him in place in time for the CWC.",
      "Enzo Maresca’s side are heading there no matter what and the signing of Delap for £30m from relegated Ipswich Town looks all but sealed. He had several clubs interested but should usurp Nicolas Jackson quickly.",
      "With a Champions League return and the £100m on offer for the CWC, expect another busy summer at Stamford Bridge.",
      "And there could be an early signing at the Emirates too as Mikel Arteta looks to boost Arsenal from second to first. As long expected, Martin Zubimendi will join from Real Sociedad.",
      "But the need for a striker remains as pressing as ever and Viktor Gyokeres is fancied to make the switch from Sporting Lisbon, although there is long-term interest in RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",

      "With the season, and a post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong for two friendlies now out of the way, Manchester United's attention can fully turn to the summer. After a dismal 2024/25, the Red Devils are in need of some transformation in the coming months.",
      "Every player has already been made available for sale, and the club appear open to a £100million offer from Al Hilal for talismanic figure Bruno Fernandes. The midfielder is said to be happy at Old Trafford, with Ruben Amorim making clear he would rather utilise other methods of raising funds for the club.",
      "But with exits for Marcus Rashford, Antony and more to facilitate, the money could quickly help boost United's chances at replenishing their squad ahead of a term without European football. The coming weeks will see Amorim's first opportunity to add players to his squad ahead of a full pre-season.",
      "Should Fernandes exit, each deal will come with additional pressure however. The Portuguese star scored 19 goals and made 20 assists despite United's struggles, and they will not be replaced easily.",
      "Manchester United are lining up Sporting Lisbon’s Pedro Gonclaves as a replacement for Bruno Fernandes. The Reds were already tracking the 26-year-old Portuguese midfielder before Al-Hilal indicated they are prepared to pay £100m for Fernandes, but a boost to their finances could see Ruben Amorim reunited with his former charge.",
      "If they accepted the approach from the Saudi side, United would have the finances to meet Sporting’s £70m valuation of Gonclaves. And his arrival could perhaps go some way to easing the anger that Amorim would feel over losing his captain.",
      "Goncalves was transformed him into a lethal attacking midfielder who can also play out wide by Amorim in Portugal after spotting his potential for goals at a pre-season training camp in 2020. He was rewarded with 23 goals in 32 games as Sporting won the Portuguese title for the first time in 19 years, the following season.",
      "Any plans Manchester United had to return for Jarrad Branthwaite this summer have been dealt a blow with Chelsea weighing up a move to sign the Everton. The 22-year-old has two years remaining on his contract and was the subject of interest from United last summer and the Red Devils were said to be interested in making another attempt in the coming months.",
      "The Red Devils saw two bids rejectedlast year, with their second reaching £50million but the Merseyside club were determined not to sell. And Toffees boss David Moyes remains reluctant to part ways with his young star, per Mail Online, despite the burgeoning interest.",
      "If United go head to head against Chelsea this summer however, they may not find much success. Branthwaite is reported to have wanted the offer of Champions League football to depart Merseyside and United are unable to offer any European football at all.",
      "Manchester United are holding internal discussions over their next move after missing out on Liam Delap, according to reports. The Ipswich Town forward is said to undergo a medical ahead of a move to Chelsea after the Blues persuaded him to come to Stamford Bridge after discussions with a number of clubs.",
      "Chelsea's offer of European football appears to have handed them the edge as United miss out on a player they are said to have been confident of securing a deal for. Nevertheless, the club already had alternatives in mind and are now set to move forward with their next move.",
      "Victor Osimhen, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jonathan David, and Randal Kolo Muani are among the names under consideration as the Red Devils attempt to sign a new forward to improve their strikeforce for Amorim."

Pereira was an important player for Fulham this season, starting 25 times in the Premier League and helping them finish 11th in the table.",
      "Pereira continued to build on his impressive performances in recent years since leaving United as he registered two goals and four assists in the middle of the park.",
      "He joined United as a 16-year-old in 2011 but found first team opportunities limited. He played just 75 times across four seasons and was loaned out to Granada, Valencia, Lazio and Flamengo before joining Fulham in a permanent move in 2022.",
      "Pereira was at United in the final days of Ferguson and also played under Louis van Gaal, Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solksjaer.",
      "Despite being coached by some of the biggest names in the game, he has been blown away by his manager Silva and hailed his preparedness for games and attention to detail.",
      "\"He's a perfectionist in making the team understand who we're playing against, the team's strengths,\" Pereira told the Daily Mail. \"He prepares our team very well, he organises everything down to the last detail, and that makes it easier for us on game day.",
      "\"I think he really has his own style. We have a plan A, a plan B. I think he might be the coach who prepares the team the most that I've ever had, even down to the last details of set pieces, even throw-ins, we know what the other team is going to do. So, I think that's a huge advantage we have.\"",
      "Silva's got Fulham promoted to the Premier League in 2022 before establishing them as a solid top flight side, with three comfortable mid-table finishes.",
      "He has since been linked with a number of top managerial roles - including Tottenham, Juventus and most recently Al Hilal.",
      "Meanwhile, Pereira has given his take on his old club's \"sad\" situation after struggling under boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "He said: \"As a fan, from the outside, it’s sad. A big club like that, seeing it the way it is, it's clearly sad. I'm used to seeing Manchester always as one of the biggest clubs in the world, always fighting at the top, fighting to be champions.",
      "\"But they're going through this phase of renewal, it's a new coach, now a new owner. So I think they'll suffer a bit, which is normal. But of course, nobody who truly likes Manchester United wants to see them in this situation.\"",

      "Matthijs de Ligt has praised Ruben Amorim for his straight-talking approach during a miserable campaign at Manchester United. United finished 15th in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final against Tottenham to ensure one of their worst ever seasons.",
      "Things got even more farcical after the conclusion of the 2024/25 season, as United headed out to the Far East on a two-game tour. They suffered the embarrassment of losing to an ASEAN All-Stars side in Kuala Lumpur, before coming from a goal down to beat Hong Kong.",
      "Amorim has won just 16 of his first 42 competitive games in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag in November. His first six months at the club has been a massive disappointment and United are now braced to tear apart their squad in pursuit of improvements next season.",
      "But despite their struggles on the pitch, Amorim has won over summer signing De Ligt through his work in press conferences. The Portuguese coach said his side were “probably the worst in Manchester United history” in January before calling them “chokers” who deserved to be booed after losing in Malaysia.",
      "“I'm from Holland so I like it,” De Ligt said. “I can understand the media are in shock because normally this doesn't happen.",

The 40-year-old inherited Ten Hag’s squad and has managed to connect with them, according to De Ligt, who joined for £42million from Bayern Munich last summer.",
      "“I've experienced many managers and he's one of the most easy to talk to as a player,” he said. “He's really into details. Before signing new players, first he's looking at the culture, what needs to change and what can be improved to become a better football club. From next season we will see more of that.",
      "“I think he wants to build a team of players who are together, fighting for each other and making the most out of what they have. Maybe before, you had the best players, but you're not a team.”",
      "After getting the post-season tour done, Amorim is already looking ahead to next season. \"Of course, to spend time with my family,\" he said after the game in Hong Kong. \"But, like I said in the press conference, I am ready to start the next one.",

      "Fernandes stands at a crossroads in his career following a dreadful campaign for United which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League and lose the Europa League final. After a miserable and embarrassing post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong, he now has to decide whether to stick by United, or cash in with a move to Al-Hilal.",
      "The Saudi club are reportedly willing to pay United £100million to sign the Portugal international, who they will then pay £100m over the course of his contract. His agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with the club’s executives this week and he reportedly has a week to decide, with Al-Hilal preparing for the Club World Cup.",
      "Amid the storm, Fernandes has stirred the pot by posting a Portuguese quote on Instagram which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "It will soon be crunch time for the 30-year-old midfielder, who is under contract with United until June 2027, although the club also have the option of another year. Fernandes has 98 goals and 87 assists in 290 games for United since joining them from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020 and has been captain for two seasons.",
      "Al-Hilal’s interest in his services is nothing new, but United’s dreadful form and need to rejuvenate their squad suddenly makes the move a distinct possibility. Whatever he does – stay with United, or move to Saudi Arabia – it now seems unlikely that Fernandes will not follow through with a previously-stated desire to play in Brazil.",
      "He will turn 31 in September and this summer’s decision would appear to rule out a future transfer to a Brazilian side further down the line. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,” he previously said.",
      "\"It’s pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part.",
      "\"I don’t really like talking about the distant future, but it’s like I said. It’s attractive football, very interesting. The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I’m not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "The contract reportedly on offer at Al-Hilal is worth a staggering £700,000 per week and would run for three years. At the end of that, he will be approaching 34 and could instead choose to move back to his native Portugal, rather than to South America, away from his extended family.",

      "The report states City \"appreciate\" Cherki's talents and see him as an ideal replacement for the outgoing Kevin de Bruyne. Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz was previously a big target for City, but Bayern Munich and Liverpool have now jumped to the front of the queue.",

      "Reports in Italy have claimed Manchester United's director of negotiations recently travelled to Italy to meet with Napoli about Victor Osimhen, who is available for transfer this summer.",
      "The Italian press says Matt Hargreaves met with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and discussed a potential swap deal involving Osimhen and Rasmus Hojlund during the exchange.",
      "Take it with a pinch of salt, but a swap deal to sign Osimhen would make sense, especially now Liam Delap has chosen to sign for Chelsea. United wanted to sign Delap from Ipswich Town, although it was inevitable that failing to qualify for European football next season would influence his thinking.",
      "Many will argue Delap shouldn't have been the preferred striker target in the first place because United need a proven goalscorer, and Delap has just one season in the Premier League.",
      "Osimhen does not have experience in England, but his scoring record has been impressive throughout his career and he is the closest thing to a guarantee of goals in the transfer market.",
      "The Nigerian scored 76 goals in 133 games for Napoli and played a key role in their 2022/23 Serie A title triumph with 26 goals. Although his form dropped off as Napoli finished 10th and had three different managers, he regained momentum during his time on loan in Turkey this term.",
      "Osimhen was sent on loan to Galatasaray because Chelsea were in talks to sign him last August, only to fail to agree personal terms and the move dramatically fell through at the 11th hour.",
      "The transfer window slammed shut and Osimhen was left stranded at Napoli, yet he needed a move away because Antonio Conte had decided he was not in his plans in Naples.",
      "Napoli failed to offload Osimhen permanently last summer, but history won't repeat itself. Osimhen will be sold and a swap deal might tick a lot of boxes for all the parties involved.",
      "Hojlund was signed from Atalanta and would return to a league he already knows. Napoli would receive a transfer fee along with Hojlund. In return, United would finally add a proven striker to their squad.",
      "It would be an ideal outcome, although it's probably wishful thinking and United might not be happy to stump up a fee, and include Hojlund in a deal, to bring Osimhen to Manchester.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea. Around £30m and Hojlund would reportedly be entertained for a sensational swap deal.",
      "There is also the issue of Osimhen's wage demands. They are rarely a problem in football, but the striker's demands were too much for Chelsea last summer and could be a stumbling block again.",
      "Osimhen is said to be demanding huge wages and Ineos have lowered the wage bill since gaining control of football operations, so he would have to compromise to sign for United.",
      "Ruben Amorim needs a striker who can consistently find the back of the net and players like Osimhen are not easily attainable very often, which means United must do everything they can to sign him.",
      "All options should be on the table, including creative transfers like potential swap deals."

      "Manchester United are close to securing the £62.5million signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha.",
      "The 26-year-old has now jetted off to South America to join up with the Brazil squad ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay but his move to Manchester is expected to be announced in the coming days.",
      "It was revealed in April that Cunha was United's number one target to fill one of the attacking midfield spots in Ruben Amorim's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation and the club have moved quickly to secure his signature.",
      "United have activated his £62.5million release clause and his 17 goals and six assists for Wolves this season make him an exciting addition to the club's attacking options.",
      "But with Cunha's arrival pretty much signed, sealed and delivered, the question now is what United's next transfer this summer will look like.",
      "One of United's next priorities will be sorting the future of captain Bruno Fernandes, one way or the other.",
      "United would ideally like to keep their player of the season and the task of trying to replace not only the influence Fernandes has on this United side, but also the 19 goals and 20 assists he registered this season will not be easy.",
      "United need clarity over Fernandes' future. If he is staying then they will build the team around their talisman. If he is leaving, then they need to find a quality replacement as soon as possible.",
      "As of now, United's immediate priority in the transfer market is to sign a new forward. United had eyed up Liam Delap as their new forward for next season, with his £30million release clause and age profile making him an attractive proposition.",
      "But the 22-year-old has chosen to join Chelsea instead, with that move set to be completed before the 12-goal striker jets off to Slovakia for the 2025 European under-21 championships.",
      "Now United must look elsewhere, with the likes of Napoli forward Victor Osimhen, Sporting CP star Viktor Gyokeres and Juventus goalscorer Dusan Vlahovic set to be on the market this summer.",
      "United will need to sell players to buy the personnel Amorim wants to carry out his philosophy next season.",
      "Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho have all impressed away from United on loan and the club have made their sales a priority this summer.",
      "United hope to get in the region of £45million for Rashford, who has been linked with a move to Barcelona and £32million for Antony, who has Atletico Madrid and Real Betis among his suitors. If Chelsea pay the £25million obligation in Sancho's loan then that will recoup £92million straight off the bat.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave United, with Chelsea and Napoli said to be interested, while Tyrell Malacia is surplus to requirements after an underwhelming loan spell with PSV.",
      "Casemiro is in the last year of his contract and could be sold this summer, while Kobbie Mainoo could also be moved on if he does not sign a new deal this summer.",
      "And then there is the possibility that one of Rasmus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee move on, too."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Sunday, June 1.",
      "The summer transfer window is officially open - at least for now. It will temporarily close on June 10 ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup, before reopening on June 16.",
      "United are aiming to complete their transfer business early, having already reached an agreement with Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim's side continue to be linked with additional attacking options to strengthen their current squad.",
      "Their hunt for a new striker has taken a setback with Liam Delap set to join Chelsea for £30million. The likes of Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli's Victor Osimhen are two prime targets after scoring a combined 91 goals between them this season.",
      "There have even been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples attempting to negotiate a deal. Osimhen is expected to push for a swift resolution, especially after his high-profile move collapsed on deadline day last summer.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked with United, largely due to his strong relationship with manager Rúben Amorim. However, the Reds appear to face stiff competition, with a growing queue of suitors that now reportedly includes Liverpool.",
      "However, further signings beyond a striker are unlikely to be pursued until funds are generated through player sales. Unfortunately, that could see Bruno Fernandes depart the club, amid continued links to a lucrative move to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves has been earmarked as a potential replacement for the Portuguese captain.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "Our first signing of the summer has been agreed#MUFC",
      "With the summer transfer window now officially open, the green light to announce a deal arrived.",
      "The club will pay £62.5million for his arrival with instalments used to spread the cost. He has signed a five-year contract with the option to extend that by 12 months included.",
      "Victor Osimhen has sent a clear wordless message with the striker expected to depart Napoli this summer.",
      "He has spent the last season on-loan at Galatasaray with goals and trophies arriving that has seen clubs keep their interest in signing him.",
      "Juventus and Chelsea have been closely linked with Manchester United also emerging as an option after they lost out to the latter on the signing of Liam Delap.",
      "With that said, he has uploaded a new Instagram post which shows what player United would be getting.",
      "A post shared by Victor Osimhen ( MFR ) (@victorosimhen9)",
      "Man United are close to securing the £62.5million signing of Wolves star Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have activated his £62.5million release clause and his 17 goals and six assists for Wolves this season make him an exciting addition to the club's attacking options.",
      "But with Cunha's arrival pretty much signed, sealed and delivered, the question now is what United's next transfer this summer will look like.",
      "More here.",
      "In 2017, the then-Coritiba youth talent Cunha was discovered by Eric Lovey, who was serving as a representative of the FIFA Secretary General.",
      "\"As soon as I heard about him I wanted to follow his performances,\" Lovey told Swiss newspaper Blick in 2018. During the Nike Cup in the USA he confirmed all the good things I had heard, especially against the Man United youth team.",
      "\"He was able to get the better of English players who were already adult-sized. I wasn’t there myself but hearing about how he played reinforced my desire to work with him.\"",
      "The Brazilian made a strong impression in Switzerland during just one season before RB Leipzig came calling in 2018.",
      "After being told he can leave Man United, Garnacho made his feelings clear during the club's post-season tour of Asia.",
      "Unlike last summer, Garnacho looks set to leave Old Trafford with the growing need to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). Garnacho was left out of the Manchester derby in December due to concerns over his attitude.",
      "In February, he walked straight down the tunnel after being substituted in the first half against Ipswich Town. That incident was followed by his public criticism of Ruben Amorim’s team selection and his description of the campaign as a 's**t' season after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "Man United want to sign Brighton & Hove Albion winger Yankuba Minteh and are keen to sign him in a blockbuster summer deal, according to Stretty News.",
      "Minteh has joined Rayan Cherki and Bryan Mbeumo on United's shortlist to strengthen their attack, but it appears that the Brighton man has emerged as a more realistic option.",
      "The 20-year-old Gambian tormented United in Brighton's 3-1 win at Old Trafford in January, scoring one and providing one assist, and that performance has not gone unnoticed.",
      "Cunha was spotted outside The Lowry Hotel on Sunday morning, checking out with his family.",
      "Sources suggested Cunha was due to dine at The Ivy on Saturday night, but only the players' representatives and United's director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, were spotted. The Brazilian headed to catch his flight to South America for international duty after leaving The Lowry Hotel.",
      "The 26-year-old has been identified as a specialist No.10 to bolster United’s attacking options behind the striker.",
      "Read more here.",
      "David Beckham believes Man United's players are not representing the club well away from the pitch.",
      "Aljenandro Garnacho and Amad were both pictured flipping their middle finger in contrasting circumstances on the tour, and Beckham has suggested the players behaved poorly.",
      "\"It’s tough times. I don’t like seeing some of things that are going on at the club,” Beckham told CBS Sports. \"On the pitch is what counts but in all honesty I’m seeing a lot of things that are not ok in my eyes as a fan and as a lover of Man United.",
      "\"You have to represent the badge. That’s what it is about. I’ve seen a lot of things where players are not acting in the right manner. We were a part of a team that was so well-mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United. We understood what the badge meant.",
      "\"Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans. We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.\"",
      "The future of Marcus Rashford remains uncertain, but United are reportedly unwilling to let him leave on loan amid interest from Barcelona.",
      "Spanish publication Sport has claimed that Barca are not willing to meet United's £40million asking price and would instead be interested in a loan deal. United are said to be \"refusing to negotiate anything other than a permanent transfer.\"",
      "If nothing changes by the final stages of the summer transfer window - after all other options have been explored - the report suggests that United would likely agree to a loan deal at that point.",
      "It's also been reported that Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, held talks with Deco at a hotel in Barcelona.",
      "When quizzed on Rashford and Luis Diaz, Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick said last week: \"Both fantastic players. I like them and we'll see what happens.\"",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has “been in conversation” with RB Leipzig sporting director Marcel Schafer about Sesko.",
      "The Bundesliga club reportedly wants an initial fee of £75million for the 22-year-old, who scored 13 goals last season. Meanwhile, journalist Christian Falk told Caught Offside: \"Man Utd have secret weapon in bid to steal Sesko from Arsenal.",
      "\"There are already talks with Arsenal. From the Premier League, beside Arsenal also Manchester United are particularly interested. [United's director of recruiment] Christopher Vivell was there to watch Sesko at the game in Wolfsburg in mid-April. He once helped discover him and brought the footballer to Salzburg as a 16-year-old in 2019.\"",
      "He previously held roles at Chelsea and RB Leipzig, but it was during his time at RB Salzburg in 2019 that he first signed Sesko, bringing the striker in from Domzale.",
      "FC Barcelona have already started working towards signing new players for next season, but Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres isn't one of them amid links to United.",
      "That's according to Barcelona sporting director, Deco, who chatted about the Catalan giants in an interview with Spanish outlet Sport. Speculation over Gyokeres' future continues to grow, as the Swede has yet to announce his next move or whether he'll simply stay at Sporting.",
      "With his family, national team coach, Sporting CP manager, and teammates all being asked about his future, it was no different for Deco. However, the ex-Portugal regular was quick to shut down any possibility of Barcelona signing Gyokeres.",
      "\"He is a great striker who did excellent things at Sporting but, right now, we are not looking in that position,\" Deco told Sport. \"We have [Robert] Lewandowski at No.9.\"",
      "Hello and welcome to our all-things Manchester United blog for Sunday, June 1.",
      "The summer transfer window officially opens today, and over the coming days, we’ll be bringing you all the latest updates on the transfer front.",

      "That is it for our live Manchester United transfer news coverage on Saturday, May 31.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest on Sunday when the transfer window OPENS.",
      "Now then, according to German outlet Kicker (via Mundo Deportivo) have claimed that Erik ten Hag wants to bring Antony to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Obviously, Ten Hag brought Antony to United and after arriving in Leverkusen, could bring him to Germany.",
      "Man United are one of the clubs interested in former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, according to reports.",
      "Graeme Bailey has reported that they have been approached by the forward's entourage a possible move back to England. Abraham spent this season on loan at AC Milan, scoring 10 goals.",
      "West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have also all shown interest.",
      "Besiktas are 'making a bold' move to attempt to sign Manchester United midfielder Casemiro this summer, according to Fanatik.",
      "Casemiro has a contract at United until summer 2026, meaning he could be available at a cut-price deal. It's added that his market value is estimated to be around £8.4million.",
      "Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, now at Besiktas, is keen to strengthen his squad following an impressive end to the season.",
      "According to A Bola in Portugal, Ruben Amorim has Sporting CP attacking midfielder Pedro Goncalves in his summer plans, with interest expected to increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",
      "It's reported that United are considering the Sporting star and weighing up the possibility of moving forward with an offer for Amorim's former player.",
      "Sporting, however, insist that they won't consider offers for Goncalves under his £67million release clause and want to keep him at the club beyond this summer.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal that they need to sign Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join ahead of the Club World Cup next month.",
      "Journalist Graeme Bailey told United In Focus: \"Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest. I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "\"They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out. The Pro League's record transfer was €90m for Neymar, they don't often spend huge amounts but they are also willing to pay £100million for Bruno.",
      "\"They didn't get their top target for this summer in the shape of Mo Salah, but Bruno could be the big one.",
      "\"Al Hilal want to win the Club World Cup, and if they can bag Inzaghi, Ronaldo and Bruno... that would be some statement. United have told Bruno he isn't going... but 100m would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.\"",
      "Manchester United want to sign Brighton & Hove Albion winger Yankuba Minteh and are keen to sign him in a blockbuster summer deal, according to Stretty News.",
      "Minteh has joined Rayan Cherki and Bryan Mbeumo on United's shortlist to strengthen their attack, but it appears that the Brighton man has emerged as a more realistic option.",
      "The 20-year-old Gambian tormented United in Brighton's 3-1 win at Old Trafford in January, scoring one and providing one assist, and that performance has not gone unnoticed.",
      "Manchester United are eager for Antony to depart the club this summer with Real Betis keen to make his loan move permanent but financial constraints pose a significant challenge.",
      "Following Wednesday night's UEFA Conference League final defeat to Chelsea, the La Liga side reportedly cannot meet United's £40million asking price. Antony's hefty weekly wage of £200,000 could also prove problematic, despite the Brazilian's enjoying his time in Seville.",
      "A report in Marca suggests that Betis may consider part-ownership of Antony in an unusual move that would see United retain some interest. Discussions between the clubs are set to take place over the next few days to explore potential agreements.",
      "A more plausible scenario might be for Betis to agree another loan for Antony while covering a substantial portion of his wages. Antony, who cost United £86m, has netted nine goals in 26 matches since joining Betis midway through the season.",
      "Matheus Cunha is still expected to become a Manchester United player, despite the delay surrounding his proposed summer move to Old Trafford, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha to Man Utd is a here we go,\" Romano told his YouTube channel. \"Matheus Cunha to Manchester United is a done deal. But many of you keep asking me where is Matheus Cunha? In the sense that there is no medical, no deal signed, no official statement, no formal steps.",
      "\"My understanding is it's just about waiting for the Visa.",
      "\"So Cunha is waiting for Visa [to be approved] and meanwhile Man Utd are preparing everything for the medical and contract signing, then for the sure the formal steps will be coordinated with the Brazilian national team staff because then Cunha will join the Brazilian national team with Carlo Ancelotti (on international duty).",
      "\"So [Man Utd] are working on the location [for the medical], working on every single step including the Visa, but Matheus Cunha will be a Manchester United player, don't worry about that.\"",
      "Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres are two of Europe's most in-demand strikers right now and Manchester United continue to be linked with both.",
      "United are in desperate need of a reliable goal-scorer this summer, having not had one since Marcus Rashford netted 30 goals in 2022/2023 under Erik ten Hag. Cristiano Ronaldo was United's last great striker in that regard with 24 goals in 2021/2022.",
      "It's why Osimhen and Gyokeres are so, so appealing. There's a sense that signing either player would fix a huge number of problems at M16 and perhaps the biggest one of them all.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United are reportedly interested in Sporting CP star Pedro Goncalves as a potential replacement for Bruno Fernandes this summer.",
      "It is claimed that Old Trafford chiefs are relaxed about Fernandes' situation. The club are prepared to listen to offers for any squad member after they finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst top-flight finish since relegation in 1974.",
      "Read more here",
      "Marcus Rashford could potentially provide Manchester United with a parting gift by securing a transfer to Barcelona ahead of next season.",
      "Despite being contracted to the Reds until 2028, the forward's future at Old Trafford appears uncertain. Rashford is widely anticipated to depart this summer and is reportedly attracting considerable interest.",
      "Several European clubs have been linked with a move for the United academy graduate, who spent the latter half of the season on loan at Aston Villa. However, it has been claimed that he has turned down all transfer offers in favour of a move to Barcelona.",

      "United are second-favourites to sign Ollie Watkins this summer, according to the bookmakers Betfair.",
      "Aston Villa boss Unai Emery has at times used Marcus Rashford up front in place of Watkins, but he has still managed to score 16 league goals this season.",
      "However, Villa were dealt a PSR blow after missing out on the Champions League and they may now have to sell some of their stars to comply with the league's financial rules.",
      "Betfair: Ollie Watkins to sign for before 2nd September 2025",

      "Ex-Manchester United man Gordon Strachan struggles to see how Matheus Cunha would fit into Ruben Amorim's current system at Old Trafford and beyond.",
      "United have identified Cunha as a primary target this summer, as they look to improve their attack under Amorim. Cunha's notable tally of 15 Premier League goals in just 31 outings during the 2024/2025 season has also reportedly caught the eye of Arsenal, who are keen on enhancing their forward options.",
      "Read more here",
      "Bruno Fernandes has a huge decision to make which could change Manchester United's future under Ruben Amorim.",
      "What happens next will be pivotal to United's 2025/26 campaign - a season where the Reds' status as one of Europe's leading clubs is under threat. That's not to say they won't remain a big club, but after finishing so low in the top-flight, teams like Newcastle and Chelsea, never mind Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City, are becoming more fashionable to support for younger fans across the globe.",
      "It's why selling Fernandes is such a bad idea after the season United have had. Imagine where they would have been without him? It's not a stretch to suggest that they could have been looking over their shoulders at the Premier League's bottom three.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Portuguese publication A Bola are claiming that United are ‘considering making an offer’ for Pedro Goncalves. It is said that the possibility will only increase if Bruno Fernandes is sold.",

      "Sporting’s position is reportedly that he can only leave if his €80m (£67m) release clause is triggered. It is said that the Portuguese champions want to renew his contract, but they will wait to see if there could be any movements in the upcoming summer transfer window.",
      "Real Betis have opened negotiations to secure a permanent deal for Antony this summer.",
      "Spanish outlet Marca have claimed that a meeting has been scheduled for next week between Betis and United to 'assess various scenarios'.",

The window will close again as soon as 7pm on Tuesday, June 10, before reopening for the full duration of the summer on Monday, June 16.",
      "It means if Manchester United are as keen to get on with the job of rebuilding head coach Ruben Amorim's squad as they should be, they could be in for a busy start to the summer.",
      "United are planning to make some much-needed changes to the landscape of their squad and it is looking increasingly likely that Matheus Cunha will set the ball rolling by arriving from Wolves. United have agreed to pay his £62.5million release clause and are now locked in talks over how to structure the payments.",
      "The Reds have long since identified the Brazilian as one of their top targets for this summer's window, and he is expected to slot straight into left-sided No.10 position. He scored 17 goals for Wolves this season and would be a welcome addition to United's attack.",
      "Alongside Cunha, United want to strengthen their attacking pool by recruiting a striker. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap had been identified as their primary target but he is now closing in on a move to Chelsea, meaning United will have to look elsewhere for a goalscorer.",
      "At this juncture, United are not understood to have settled on an alternative. Signing a reliable striker has to be United's top priority this summer, making links with Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli ace Victor Osimhen understandable. However, United may find it difficult to recruit the goal-getter they are in need of as a result of failing to qualify for next season's Champions League.",
      "Elsewhere, United are expected to try and recruit a goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot, while the addition of a midfielder is also on their to-do list.",
      "However, much of what United will be able to do on the subject of incomings will rest on outgoings. It is no secret they need to generate funds via player sales this summer, and departures could reach double figures. They have also got to be mindful of the financial rules.",
      "\"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules,\" Amorim told the media in Malaysia. \"We are not allowed to do much in this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.\"",
      "However, United plan to raise funds by selling attackers Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. Garnacho has been informed he can leave at the right price and Rashford, Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Rashford is available for £40m, Antony will be available for around £32.5m and Chelsea, who signed Sancho on loan last summer, have an obligation to buy him for a fee that could be as high as £25m. However, the Londoners can pay a £5m penalty not to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "In addition, no other member of the squad is safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit. Bruno Fernandes is currently the subject of interest from Al-Hilal and it remains to be seen if the Saudi Arabia side will table a bid matching the £100m figure that has been touted. The United captain is understood to be considering the move.",
      "Meanwhile, United also want to sell forgotten left-back Tyrell Malacia, who has spent the second half of this season out on loan at Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. A decision on Casemiro's future could go either way after Amorim indicated the Brazilian had changed his mind amid the role he played in helping United reach the Europa League final."

      "United were defeated 1-0 in Malaysia, but they won 3-1 in Hong Kong to end the post-season tour on a positive note.",
      "Amass featured in both friendlies. The youngster enjoyed a breakthrough into the first-team this season, making his senior bow against Leicester in March, which led to further appearances.",
      "After winning against Hong Kong, Amass spoke to MUTV and said: \"It was a good game, the pitch was tough to play on. The second half, the boys got it over the line.",
      "\"I think the tour has been good. I've been to places I haven't been before and the fans are so crazy, they've shown their passion. It's good to be around the lads and everyone is together.",

      "Ashley Fletcher is a good talker. Which is just as well given conversations have reinvigorated his career.",
      "Fletcher came through the ranks at Manchester United, turning down a new contract for more opportunities at West Ham. Now 29, he’s reflecting on a transformative year at Blackpool, sparked by football and psychology.",
      "Ex-United captain Steve Bruce is Fletcher's manager at Bloomfield Road and helped turn his season around on the pitch, while sports psychologist Martin Perry did the same off it.",
      "Fletcher feels those honest and frank discussions have sparked an uptick in his career, which he candidly described as being in danger of petering out as we chat for an engaging interview.",
      "\"If anything I should have sought help sooner but I tried to solve it myself and things didn't work,\" he said. \"But I can put my hand on my heart and say that I feel at home with the club.\"",
      "Fletcher scored once in his first 18 games for Blackpool. A chat with Bruce and the coaching staff followed in November as player and manager spoke openly. He then hit 10 goals in 30 matches as he spearheaded the club's play-off push, which ultimately came up just short.",
      "\"From November onwards it is the best I have played in the last few years and I am really enjoying my football and life,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I needed to get my career back on track and thankfully him and his coaching staff have trusted me and given me what I needed.",
      "\"For my personally and how to get the best out of me I want to feel happy and secure at a place, I feel really at home here. It is somewhere I want to keep working and progressing and I feel comfortable.\"",
      "Fletcher will be at Blackpool next season having penned a two-year contract when signing last summer. Prior to that he had been on loan for two-and-a-half seasons and not since he was at Middlesbrough between 2017 and 2021 has he been as settled as he is now.",
      "\"When I look back at the last few years of my career I have been on loan and not found a home, it is being sent here and there and hopefully you can do well,\" he reflected.",
      "\"When I signed for Blackpool I wanted to find a home and a base which I haven't had over the last few years. People look at me as a big 6 foot 5 striker and say 'he's good in the air' but that is not my game. It is my game to get on the ball and play with the ball on the floor and the manager realised that and then gave me the confidence to be a starter in the team.",
      "\"It would have been quite easy for the manager to disregard me like others have previously but he was the total opposite along with the coaching staff and for that I am thankful. I come in with a smile on my face every day and I am enjoying it.\"",
      "Fletcher's work away from football has a lot to do with that smile as well. He's back in the north west, living just outside Manchester with his family, and the Bolton-born former United player has found the perfect balance.",
      "He added: \"I speak with Martin, who I used over the years, and things that we speak about is about having a base, being happy in your life. That can lead to doing better in your work.",
      "\"When you are constantly thinking about where you are going to be next year, or you're travelling or not settled, it is about putting down roots. Not thinking about the financial side, for me it was all about where I was going to start feeling comfortable.",
      "\"I felt like I was at a crossroads where I could either peter out and drop down and keep not performing or seek help and really give this a go. Martin Perry has been unbelievable.",
      "\"Part of my routine is focusing on what is important. That has been so important to me, since I have been speaking to him, I have had to put in the work, but it all moulds into one and the outcome has been decent performances which wasn't the case in the last few years.\"",
      "Fletcher brings up his chats with Perry unprompted. It's not the first time he's used his services, having previously consulted him during a loan spell at Sunderland when the striker said he was 'having a tough time'. But that was seven years ago, when opening up to psychologists was perhaps not the done thing for a footballer.",
      "The landscape has changed and Fletcher seemingly feels a sense of responsibility in talking about his need for help. His career began at United, where he was on the fringes of the first team before deciding to leave Old Trafford in the pursuit of first team football in the Premier League at West Ham.",
      "He initially left on loan for League One side Barnsley, winning the Football League Trophy and third tier play-off final at Wembley during a hugely successful spell.",
      "But while he was at Oakwell, a striker vacancy at United opened up. Fletcher may well have been first in the queue. Instead, Will Keane was afforded an opportunity in an FA Cup tie against Shrewsbury Town and when injury struck him, Marcus Rashford was handed a chance and didn't look back.",
      "Fletcher didn't either. He didn't wonder what if, he simply thought what next?",
      "\"Everyone asks me with Marcus if you stayed would you have got an opportunity?\" he said.",
      "\"But football is sliding doors and I have no bitterness. Marcus has gone on to be what he is, which is a world-class player. He has done unbelievably well.",
      "\"For me I felt it was being real and that if there was an opportunity to go and play elsewhere in the Premier League then I should take it. It was lovely to see someone like Marcus who had come through from when he was five or six and for him to take that chance. I was happy with what I was doing.\"",
      "What Fletcher was doing was seeking minutes. His six months at Barnsley yielded eight goals in 16 games and two winning trips to Wembley. He wanted more. West Ham came calling, offering top flight chances and a four-year deal.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" he said of his decision to leave United when there was an offer on the table from the Reds.",
      "\"There was an opportunity before I left to go on loan to Barnsley where I could have been on the bench against Watford. One of my best mates in Sean Goss was on the bench and Marcus was on the bench and I wasn't picked.",
      "\"I was thinking then that it was going to be difficult. I went to Barnsley and concentrated on myself and that was the most important thing.",
      "\"It was my dream to play for United first team but my dream at the start was to play pro football. Even going out to Barnsley on loan was a great achievement for me but I wanted it to be the first step.\"",
      "West Ham offered a four-year contract, the promise of top flight football and an improved salary. Within months of signing he was back at Old Trafford, scoring for Hammers in the League Cup. A year later he joined Middlesbrough for £6.5million. He was a regular for three years at the Riverside before a move to Watford which didn't work out and led to a series of loans.",
      "Fletcher still speaks to former United teammates and he encounters plenty on a weekly basis in opposition line-ups.",
      "\"You look at the teams in the leagues that I play in and there is always one or two who have come through the academy at United,\" he said. \"That is a testament to the club for how good they are at producing good players, but also people with a good attitude who can survive in the football world.",
      "\"I can honestly say coming through there and growing up surrounded by greatness and eliteness, there is no better place to learn your trade, not just as a player but as a person.\"",
      "Fletcher's breakthrough into the senior squad was under Louis van Gaal, a man he has huge respect for even if that first team call never quite came.",
      "\"I loved Louis, I didn't train under Sir Alex, but Louis was top and he was really good for the young lads,\" Fletcher reflects.",
      "\"Being involved in the first team training environment was unbelievable. I was training with the first-team squad for a few months here and there.",
      "\"Louis was very methodical. A lot of drills specific to who we might be playing next but I loved it. Louis actually quite liked me from the feedback I got but at the time my body wasn't developed enough to play in the Premier League.",
      "\"I was training with Robin van Persie, Falcao, Rooney, Di Maria, the talent was ridiculous.",
      "\"I learned every day and I didn't feel out of place either. I just dreamt of getting an opportunity but it never came. But I am happy with how things worked out.\"",
      "And happy to talk, too. Fletcher will continue to do his talking on and off the pitch."

      "The competition clashes with a busy period in the Premier League with the hectic Christmas schedule often a defining point in the calendar while the FA Cup starts in January for Premier League clubs and the winter transfer window will also open.",
      "Onana is currently first choice goalkeeper at Old Trafford and while his long term future remains uncertain, the unconvincing performances of back up Altay Bayindir - who may depart this summer - highlight the importance of United adding at least a second choice stopper to the ranks this summer.",
      "Mazraoui's absence would be keenly felt given his adaptability and availability this term while Amad departing would greatly hamper United's attacking threat. The 22-year-old has been a standout performer for the Reds this season and contributed 11 goals.",

      "Besiktas are 'making a bold' move to attempt to sign Manchester United midfielder Casemiro this summer, according to the latest reports. Former United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to strengthen his squad following an impressive end to the season.",
      "Solskjaer was appointed as Besiktas' new head coach in January - his first managerial role since he left United back in November 2021. The Norwegian got off to a flying start, winning seven of his opening nine matches in charge. Although Besiktas stuttered in March, they regained their form and finished fourth in Super Lig, enough to secure Europa League qualification.",
      "During his time at Besiktas so far, Solskjaer has won 11 and drawn four of his 21 matches in charge and he is expected to be backed in the summer transfer window, as they look to mount a title charge next season.",
      "According to Turkish outlet Fanatik, Casemiro has been identified as a target and Besiktas are said to be keen on bringing the defensive midfielder to Vodafone Park.",
      "Casemiro has a contract at United until summer 2026, meaning he could be available at a cut-price deal. It's added that his market value is estimated to be around £8.4million.",
      "This isn't the first time Besiktas have been linked with a move for Casemiro. They were tipped to sign the Brazilian in January, but he stayed at Old Trafford and has since been an important member of the United side.",
      "In fact, the 33-year-old started in each of United's knockout matches en route to the Europa League final. He formed a solid partnership alongside Manuel Ugarte and scored in each leg against Athletic Club de Bilbao in the semi-final. Across the season, Casemiro finished on 42 appearances, netting five times and providing three assists.",
      "When asked about Casemiro's improved performances earlier this month, Amorim said: \"He improved a lot also, you can see [that] not in the way he plays but the way he runs, and you can see it. We have the data to show he worked really, really hard. He's a very good example. But he was not playing.",
      "\"Even Toby [Collyer] sometimes was playing in front of him. And now it's hard to take Casemiro [out]. So it's a lesson for all the players in Manchester United: no matter what the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high.",
      "\"We need to let them understand. Sometimes it’s better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender, and put the wing backs pressing high. So these small things we are understanding, trying to cope with all the characteristics of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.\""

      "Manchester United will find themselves having a big decision to make if Al-Hilal submit a big-money offer for captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "It is understood the United ace is considering a move to the Saudi Arabian club amid suggestions they could table a £100million bid for his signature. They are keen to get on with a deal as quickly as possible so that Fernandes can feature at the upcoming Club World Cup.",
      "United have refused to rule out the prospect of selling anyone in this summer's transfer window, meaning Fernandes could be offloaded if the club receives an offer that is too good to turn down, despite chief executive Omar Berrada admitting earlier this year nobody will be sold purely for financial purposes.",
      "If United lost a player as important and as influential as Fernandes, he would leave a gaping hole in need of filling. With that said, MEN Sport has had a look at three ways United could line-up if they were to say farewell to their much-loved talisman:",
      "Like Fernandes, Kobbie Mainoo is not yet assured of his United future. He found himself in and out of the team in the second half of the season and regularly flittered between the centre of midfield and one of the two No.10 spots, meaning his long-term position in Ruben Amorim's plans is yet to be determined.",
      "Most United supporters believe Amorim underused Mainoo in the second half of the season, failing to make the most of his talent. But there is no denying his performances, albeit impacted by injury, were not as eye-catching as they were in 2023/24.",
      "A player as talented as Mainoo ought to be central to United's future plans, and he can force his way into a position that makes him a key figure.",
      "By no means a direct comparison to Fernandes, he could operate from the centre of midfield and next to Manuel Ugarte, with the onus on the latter to provide the defensive nous and control that allows Mainoo to play the progressive, forward-thinking game he is capable of.",
      "Fernandes, of course, is equally capable of playing as both a No.8 and as a No.10. If Amorim views his long-term role as one of the two playmakers, United are already working on trying to sign someone who can pick up that baton in Matheus Cunha.",
      "United have agreed to pay his £62.5m release clause and are now in talks with Wolves over the structure of the payments. He is expected to be United's first summer signing and become Amorim's first-choice left-sided No.10, meaning if Fernandes is to stay, he could find himself automatically operating as a No.8.",
      "It would then be a toss up between Mason Mount and Amad to occupy the other No.10 berth. Both players are well thought of by Amorim and will equally believe they are worthy of a starting berth, but Amad is also capable of playing as a right wing-back.",
      "If both Amad and Mount start, Amorim may be forced to going slightly more defensive in the centre of midfield, requiring him to task Casemiro and Ugarte with sitting deep and soaking up counter-attacks and sniffing out any danger.",
      "The prospect of United banking £100m for Fernandes, who will turn 31 in September, would open up avenues of opportunity for them to explore this summer. It is no secret United want to sharpen their attack by signing a goalscorer alongside Cunha.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, it remains to be seen which direction United's hunt for a goal-getter will head in. However, links connecting them with the likes of Victor Osimhen of Napoli and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres are unlikely to go away soon.",
      "If United can fund a move for a striker of that ilk, they have to try everything possible to land one. Never have United been so desperate for a proven goal-getter.",
      "If, for example, United are lucky enough to sign Osimhen, he will automatically replace Rasmus Hojlund as the starting striker. Depending on how far their budget stretches, Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked with a move to M16, meaning he would complete a star-studded, new-look attack."

      "Manchester United legend David Beckham has slammed the club’s current squad, as he feels the players are not showing respect and some things going on are “not ok.”",
      "United quickly departed for a post-season tour after their 15th-placed Premier League campaign finished. They also endured the ignominy of losing the Europa League final prior to that.",
      "Though they won the second tour game – 3-1 against Hong Kong – things went badly in the first, as they were beaten 1-0 by ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "They were booed off by supporters, which manager Ruben Amorim felt they might “need”. But that was seemingly not the worst of their problems.",
      "Indeed, Alejandro Garnacho was accused of pushing a fan, while Amad Diallo went viral in a photo with his middle finger up at supporters.",
      "United legend Beckham does not feel some of what’s going on has been acceptable for United standards.",
      "“It’s tough times. I don’t like seeing some of things that are going on at the club,” Beckham told CBS Sports.",
      "“On the pitch is what counts but in all honesty I’m seeing a lot of things that are not okay in my eyes as a fan and as a lover of Man United.",
      "“You have to represent the badge. That’s what it is about. I’ve seen a lot of things where players are not acting in the right manner.",
      "“We were a part of a team that was so well mannered. We understood what it meant to play for Manchester United. We understood what the badge meant.",
      "“Wherever we travelled, whether it was in Europe or in Asia, we respected the fans.",
      "“We respected the fact that they were turning up, paying money and wanting you to sign and take pictures. You respect that.”",
      "Indeed, United have one of the largest fanbases in the world, and it is not a good look for their current crop to be seen to be disrespecting them.",
      "Things on the field are clearly not good, too, and the board will have to spend the summer rectifying things so that the Manchester outfit have a better time next season, trying to bounce back from 15th in the league.",
      "Manchester United legends Gary Neville and David Beckham have ‘completed a takeover’ of Salford City worth around £15m as part of a ‘new consortium’.",
      "Marcus Rashford has not ruled out a Man Utd return and could embark on the sort of redemption arc which embarrassed Real Madrid and Jose Mourinho.",
      "Harry Kane has rocketed while Jordan Henderson is moving again. Jude Bellingham keeps rising up the foreign-based England player ranks.",
      "This is an England team made up from those who were the first new picks of a new manager’s reign. Dan Burn or MLS next?"

      "PSG have taken the long road to Champions League glory – with humiliations by Manchester United and Newcastle – but Luis Enrique has ended their ‘obsession’.",
      "",
      "“The Champions League is not at all an obsession – that is over. I said that at the first press conference with Luis Enrique,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi with all the conviction of a man whose sportswashing had shrunk under the pressure of one too many loads.",
      "“We are building a new identity; our own style, our own principles of how to play, an offensive play, and a new culture. That’s what we want, and then the results will follow.",
      "“We are building a team that is really playing as a team. We want our players to enjoy playing, our staff to enjoy coaching, and for our fans to enjoy it when you watch.”",
      "Ten days later, PSG were beaten 4-1 at St James’ Park. The players, staff and fans cannot have particularly enjoyed watching Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff and Fabian Schar score against Europe’s perennial underachievers – although the schadenfreude was irresistible for neutrals.",
      "It has been a long, arduous and often absurd journey to the summit. PSG have avoided the ultimate ignominy of exiting at the group stage ever since this odyssey began, but the trade-off for that has been a preposterous propensity to stumble at all manner of other hurdles: consecutive away-goal eliminations by Barcelona and Chelsea; victims of La Remontada; a humiliation so thorough it forced Manchester United to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer their manager for more than two years; being entirely and utterly Karim Benzema’d in the Bernabeu.",
      "PSG and the Champions League had been in a toxic, unrequited relationship for years, and the former was kidding itself if they ever believed themselves to be in a position to declare it “over”.",
      "But Luis Enrique has broken the cycle.",
      "The Spaniard’s words at his unveiling became a eulogy at the funeral of Inter’s entire psyche. “The attacking identity is non-negotiable – it’s my philosophy. You have to adapt to your players, my job is to get the best out of my players individually and collectively. I am committed to putting a winning team together and I have no doubt that I will be able to do that and give PSG fans something they will like.”",
      "There were tears in the stands, in the dugout, on the pitch. It was historic but harrowing, a traumatic scene of youthful exuberance obliterating grizzled experience. It was the end of the road for Inter, who would have taken Boyz II Men 0 as early as the 20th minute had they been offered the choice. And after almost a decade and a half it is the belated start of what PSG hope to translate into a period of utter dominance.",
      "Over the course of those 90 minutes it was difficult to envisage any other scenario developing over the next few years. The youngest starting line-up in a Champions League final this century produced two of the five youngest ever European Cup final scorers. The man of the match was 19-year-old Desire Doue. The only player older than 30 of the 16 used was record appearance maker Marquinhos. This is not a group on the verge of disbanding.",
      "That provided an interesting juxtaposition with Inter, for whom this was a second Champions League final in three years, but with the tangible sense it would be their last together. The future of Simone Inzaghi is deeply uncertain, three of their starters were at least 36 and the rest were made to look twice as old. PSG started by hammering the ball out for a throw-in deep in Inter’s half and for the subsequent hour and a half rarely afforded them the opportunity to escape.",
      "This was their last stand and the early mistakes betrayed it, culminating in the double salvo from Federico Dimarco which ended the game as a contest. He was caught in his own offside trap and then later isolated by Doue down the right as PSG took the quickest two-goal lead in final history.",
      "Willian Pacho was winning everything, including a battle with Nico Barella as the Inter midfielder hoped to shepherd the ball out for a corner, only for the PSG centre-half to poke it away and launch the counter which produced the second goal. Achraf Hakimi started popping up at centre-forward and on the left-wing.",
      "Hakan Calhanoglu, the set-piece master, was gifted a presentable free-kick in the vicinity of the PSG area and thumped it straight out for a goal kick early in the second half; it summed the proceedings up neatly.",
      "Then came the landslide. Inzaghi made his changes, four by the hour mark. The sight of Matteo Darmian taking to the pitch somehow did not galvanise Inter but PSG derived motivation from it anyway, hitting a ridiculous triple punch of quality goals: Vitinha to Doue; Ousmane Dembele to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia; Bradley Barcola to fellow substitute Senny Mayulu.",
      "It was almost painful to watch by the end, particularly through the prism of the hapless Francesco Acerbi.",
      "Perhaps only Kylian Mbappe had a more uncomfortable night as the modern-day Michael Owen: the prodigy distracted by the lights of Real Madrid, only for his boyhood club to thrive and immediately capture the sport’s biggest prize in his absence. He might be able to console himself with having scored in that Newcastle defeat.",
      "As it is, the evening belonged not to Al-Khelaifi – despite some weird yet entirely predictable “win for football” nonsense – but Luis Enrique. His personal story is touching enough but even on a professional level it is refreshing to watch such a phenomenally talented and often overlooked coach achieve something so historic.",
      "This PSG success cannot be framed properly without acknowledging the vast spend needed to deliver it. With the highest wage bill in Europe and over £200m invested on transfers this season alone it is, in many ways, simple maths. But Enrique going where incredible managers before him could not at least means something.",
      "And that thing, ultimately, is a Super Cup final against Spurs. It is the showdown of Europe’s true greatest teams we all deserve, and the only real way to celebrate the long-awaited climax of an “obsession”.",
      "There are 10 Champions League final participants who are either Premier League rejects or never made it there at all…",
      "Chelsea rejected Luis Enrique twice, Arsenal turned him down for two reasons, Spurs pulled out at the last hurdle and Manchester United came close too.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique insists he’s “not worried at all” about facing Arsenal after the French side’s unexpected defeat against Nice.",
      "Youri Tielemans and Luis Enrique have been speaking to the press ahead of Aston Villa’s huge Champions League clash with Paris-Saint Germain."

      "It’s not all Man Utd doom and gloom\nI get all the doom and gloom around United these days, but I don’t see the picture is as bad as people make out.",
      "Sure, United are in a bad place, primarily down to utterly appalling recruitment over the past 8-10-12 years, but the club isn’t dead just yet.",
      "And sure, the club has debt saddled on it by its owners – its not ideal, but again it’s not the death of the club just yet. Debt is designed for companies to use. It would have been nice not to have had the debt, but that’s our Glazers legacy, so we have to deal with it. People and pundits seem to say that United are dead and buried because this summer we can’t afford to stump up 100m for X and 75m for Y, and 80m Z wont come because we’re not in the Champions League.",
      "But that didn’t stop Bournemouth, Forest, Fulham, Villa (to name but a few) all climbing the table in recent seasons.",
      "Forest were many pundits’ picks for relegation last year, and having unearthed (amongst others) two very cheap diamonds in central defense, pushed for the top 4 until the very last game of the season. Bournemouth continue to sit top half of the table, give pretty much anyone a decent game, and have only ever paid over 25m once in their history. Ditto Fulham, who have never paid more than the 34m they paid for Emil Smith Rowe. Ditto Brentford. Villa only came back up to the Prem 6 seasons ago….!",
      "The point being, just because we cant have a summer of getting all the current fad names, doesn’t mean we’re done and dusted. Ok, I agree that the squad needs some decent additions, but at least our transfer business is getting better.",
      "6-8 years ago, we’d go and pay crazy money for names like Pogba and Di Maria, and then get frustrated when they didn’t return value. And fill in the gaps with loans of Falcao etc. Yuk.",
      "2-4 years ago was utterly disastrous – Sancho, Antony, (if Greenwood hadn’t smacked his girlfriend, we’d have saved £150m not having to buy those two), Hojlund (nowhere near value, but think he’s been unlucky, if still below average). I love Casemiro, but hard to say his signing was astute and financially sound.",
      "Last season – far better. Mazraoui, good value. De Ligt – meh, at least we didn’t pay 75, 40 was probably about right if he can stay fit. Yoro – looks a decent player and will only improve. Ugarte – hmmmm not so sure yet, looks a little lightweight for a DMC in the prem, and passing is shocking. Zirkzee – decent footballer, just a shame about his total lack of pace, odd signing.",
      "Amorim’s only signings so far: Dorgu – I’ve seen fans moaning about him cos he’s not playing like peak Roberto Carlos. The kid is 20 years old ….. what is it with people nowadays. He will get better, stronger, brighter. And Heaven, £1.5m for an 18 year old who already looks pretty useful, definitely great value.",

      "Bruno for £100m? Really?\nAshmundo says Utd shouldn’t sell Bruno for less than £100m. He is 30 years old, good for Utd but not quite as good as Utd fans think he is, surely even the Saudi league wouldn’t pay that sort of money for him.",
      "Outside the PL and probably Portugal I’m not sure he is even that big a name, and there is no way any of the top teams in the PL would be interested in him.",
      "I suppose it could be a way for some Saudi investor to gain favour with the club.\nMel – Dublin, Berlin, Athlone Town",
      "",
      "Spurs and pointless transfer talk\nI can’t help but think “who can Spurs buy now we have CL?” Which is pointless as we don’t know if we will have the same manager.",
      "That said; with Villa in financial strife and Forest not making the CL those two clubs have four players I would be all over; Gibbs-White, Tielemans, Rodgers and Murillo. Not all of them as they’ll cost a king’s ransom but I can see at least one big names from both sides being snapped up.",
      "Bournemouth aren’t desperate for cash anymore but Semenyo is a terrific player, however if Kerkez does go along with Huijsen then I can’t see a world where they sell their three best players.",
      "Joao Paulinha isn’t enjoying life in Munich, we should be all over a player like that; experienced and durable in that tricky no. 6 role.",
      "Then there are the dream players; Wharton, Eze and Lacroix have all been exceptional at Palace (Glasner too 😬) and maybe it is the season they cash in on Eze…or, f*ck it; bring in Nico Williams and Sesko.",

      "Are promoted clubs really screwed?\nThere’s been a lot of discussion, especially on this website, about how the PL is becoming a closed shop and the gap is widening etc etc. Apparently the 3 promoted clubs are already doomed before they even kick a football!",
      "Personally I think this is all a bit premature and there’s too much reading into a couple of seasons where, frankly, the promoted teams were just poor and barely even gave themselves a chance at staying up.",
      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling. And they shouldn’t be blaming the Premier League for that.\nRob, Surrey, Bees fan",

      "And Barca sporting director Deco admitted earlier this month that Diaz and Rashford are two players that the La Liga side are looking at.",
      "Speaking to RAC1, Deco said: “Talking about players who have contracts with other clubs is complicated out of respect. We like Luis [Diaz], we like [Marcus] Rashford, and we like other players. When we go to the market, there are names that we know and that could improve the team.",
      "“Our big priority is to strengthen what we have at home, renewals of Pedri, Gavi, Araujo, Raphinha, Kounde… I understand that when people talk about signings, they always think about players coming from abroad, but for me, renewals are also signings. Lamine is the best signing in history.",

      "A deal for Rashford or Diaz will be expensive for Barcelona to complete with the Catalan giants still sorting their finances out after years of struggles.",
      "And now Spanish publication Sport claims that Barcelona’s ‘plan is to try a loan’ for Man Utd forward Rashford as the La Liga outfit ‘aren’t willing to shell out the roughly €40 million the Red Devils are asking for.’",

      "The report adds that ‘if the financial situation continues to prevent the transfer of Luis Díaz or the possibility of reaching an agreement with United for the loan of Rashford, the club will activate other interesting names in its attempt to strengthen the left flank of the attack.’",

      "Brown told Football Insider: “Arsenal are prepared to let Martinelli go. His form has been very up and down, and they’re not 100 per cent satisfied with what he offers.",
      "“Some Saudi clubs have been looking at him, and if they come in with a bid that Arsenal deem acceptable, I don’t think they’ll stand in his way.",

      "",
      "Yann Sommer\nSommer was very high on Manchester United’s shortlist to replace David De Gea in the summer of 2023, and although Bayern Munich swooped in the January window to ruin the Red Devils’ chances of a free transfer, it was Inter who then took advantage of a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ with the Bundesliga club to secure his £6m signing as a replacement for the guy United bought for £44m as their new No.1.",
      "And while Sommer has played a vital role in securing Inter’s place in the Champions League final, pulling off several remarkable saves in the knockout stages, United got to the Europa League final in spite of Andre Onana, who then definitely could have done better to deny Brennan Johnson his winning goal for Tottenham.",

      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",

      "It is believed it would cost £35million for PSG to sell the Frenchman. But it’s said the preference at Old Trafford would be to land a striker who is already experienced in the Premier League.",
      "As such Mateta has come back into their thinking, especially after playing a key role in Palace winning the FA Cup. He assisted a goal in the 3-0 semi-final win over Aston Villa, while the Palace man has been in electric form in the Premier League recently.",
      "This season, Mateta scored 14 goals and assisted two. The report places him at £40million, though our friends at TEAMtalk suggest the Eagles would not let him go for less than £50million.",
      "They state that negotiations could be tricky, as Palace are keen to retain Mateta. He will play European football with them for the first time in his career, and that’s something which is not on offer at Old Trafford.",

      "They will reportedly soon confirm the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, for £62.5million. The Red Devils will hope that the Brazilian fares better than other recent expensive attackers.",

      "“I wouldn’t be averse to him going on loan for six months, to score goals, find his feet, and get a bit of confidence. People don’t understand that when you play for Manchester United, it’s about the mentality and dealing with the expectations.”",

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4=) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – were said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6=) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",
      "",
      "9) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. And they surely become an option again after reaching the Champions League.",

It wasn’t without its moments – Andriy Shevchenko’s cruelly disallowed goal, Antonio Conte hitting the post and Andrea Pirlo striking the bar – but that second half in particular was a test of spectator endurance more than anything.",

An audience not quite anaesthetised to the stylings of Jose Mourinho found that the novelty of two surprise success stories had worn off long before full-time as the Portuguese starved the occasion of any intrigue.",
      "Monaco failed to muster a single shot on target; Porto themselves only managed four as they registered less than 50% possession.",
      "",
      "30) 2010 – Bayern Munich 0-2 Inter Milan\nAs the BBC said at the time, it ‘might not have been one for the purists’. Mourinho was once at great pains to point out that he couldn’t properly empathise with Tottenham upon his appointment as manager in November 2019 because “I never lost a Champions League final”. This was a fine example as to why, as Inter channelled the determination and resilience of their semi-final victory over Barcelona to secure a remarkable Treble in unexceptional circumstances.",

Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",
      "",
      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",

There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",

On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",

      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium.

      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",

      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",

      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",
      "",
      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert. With two managerial legends in Louis van Gaal and Fabio Capello filling the dugouts, there might never have been a more stacked final in terms of talent. The game itself was no less captivating.",
      "",
      "13) 2015 – Juventus 1-3 Barcelona\n“Spectacular” was the word Luis Enrique used to describe Barcelona’s win over Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final. History is written by the victors, of course, but it seems a generous interpretation. Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",

      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour. Lionel Messi and David Villa had secured a third European Cup in six seasons before Sir Alex Ferguson knew what hit him, while Rooney was left begging for mercy.",
      "",
      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",
      "",
      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",
      "",
      "7) 1999 – Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\nWhen we finally drain the well of unoriginal content ideas and come to rank the greatest two-minute spells in Champions League history, Manchester United’s stoppage-time exploits against Bayern Munich in 1999 might well fare better. But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",
      "",
      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt. Jurgen Klopp side started far better but fell behind after an hour, only to equalise eight minutes later. Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",
      "",
      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard.

      "Matheus Cunha signs for Man Utd after they triggered the £62.5m release clause in the Brazil international's contract at Wolves; despite interest from other clubs, Cunha wanted to play at Old Trafford and was not deterred by their failure to qualify for the Champions League",
      "Sunday 1 June 2025 14:17, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed a deal for Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "Cunha, who moves to Old Trafford on a five-year contract with the option of a year's extension, becomes Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer as he looks to rebuild a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League.",
      "United met the £62.5m release clause in the 26-year-old's contract after agreeing to a structure of payment over two years. His signing is subject to visa and registration, say United.",
      "Cunha, who is set to play as a No 10 for United, scored 17 goals and provided six assists for Wolves last season.",
      "Despite interest from other teams, Cunha wanted to play for United. He thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and was not deterred by them missing out on Champions League football following their defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Five Premier League teams, including United, wanted to sign the Brazil international this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among those who held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for around £34m, registered 15 goals and six assists across his 33 appearances in the Premier League throughout the 2024/25 season.",
      "\"Manchester United are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho, [Marcus] Rashford and Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with [Alejandro] Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"Cunha's the type of player that suits this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend that they're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."
