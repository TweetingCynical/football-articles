      "Anthony Elanga admitted he'd received a phone call from Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak... but joked it was concerning his errant shooting on international duty. The Nottingham Forest winger had been linked with interest from the Magpies ahead of Sweden's match against Hungary.",
      "The Swedes came away 2-0 victors without the help of Newcastle star Isak, who pulled out of the squad through injury, as Elanga put in a starring performance but failed to get on the scoresheet. Benjamin Nygren and Yasin Ayari secured the victory for Jon Dahl Tomasson's team away from home.",
      "Elanga scored six goals and provided 11 assists as Nottingham Forest qualified for the UEFA Conference League, after looking set for Champions League competition following a strong start to the season. The former Manchester United ace was a key member of Nuno Espirito Santo's team throughout 2024/25 in his second season with the club.",
      "Newcastle are said to have enquired over a deal for Elanga, who has three years remaining on his contract with Forest. Last summer saw the Premier League's fifth-placed side make a late £35million bid for the Swede but never came close to making a deal.",
      "And Eddie Howe appears keen to rest the Midlands side's resolve once again, with Newcastle able to offer Champions League football. However, it is reported it would take a figure greater than £50m to find success.",
      "Elanga appears relaxed over such speculation. “ There is a lot of talk,\" he said, per Sport Witness.",
      "\"I focus on what I can do and my focus today was on the match. In football there are always rumours. The most important thing is that I focus on what I can control.”",
      "“I guess there will always be scouts wherever I play,\" he added. \"As long as I stay focused and do my best in the match.",
      "\"I just keep my focus and what I can control. That’s what I can do on and off the field. I focus on the next day and action. That’s what I can do.\"",
      "Elanga was asked if he'd received a call from Isak and admitted his international team-mate had made an attempt. But joked it was likely about his shooting performance on Friday night.",
      "\"He must have tried to call me about the match, that I should have scored,\" he said.",

      "Newcastle are plotting a double swoop for Joao Pedro and Anthony Elanga after losing out on Bryan Mbeumo. The Magpies had been linked with a move for the Brentford forward this summer.",
      "He had been identified as an ideal addition ahead of Newcastle’s return to the Champions League next term. But they faced serious competition from Premier League rivals Manchester United, with the Red Devils now looking likely to secure his signature after Mbeumo expressed his desire to move to Old Trafford.",
      "That decision has forced Newcastle to look elsewhere with a number of Premier League stars having been identified as alternatives. According to The Telegraph, Eddie Howe’s side will step up their pursuit of Brighton forward Pedro.",

      "Away from Pedro, Newcastle have also been linked with a move for Nottingham Forest star Anthony Elanga. The Magpies are understood to have submitted an enquiry for the winger, with discussions at an early stage.",
      "Forest would demand a lofty fee for the former Man United man having previously rebuffed a £35m approach from Newcastle in January. Regarding Mbeumo, United still have to agree terms with Brentford over the forward, with Thomas Frank having warned the Bees have a very lofty asking price in mind.",
      "Speaking earlier this month, he said: \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",

      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”"

      "Manchester United have been handed a serious problem after Chelsea refused to sign Jadon Sancho permanently, because he has no intention of ever playing for the club again. Sancho had appeared set to join the Blues permanently after spending the season on loan in west London, only for negotiations to break down.",
      "Chelsea ultimately decided they would rather pay United a £5million fee than go through with signing the winger for £25m. Sancho is paid around £300,000 per week by United and he and Chelsea had been unable to find a compromise on his wages, forcing a rethink for all parties.",
      "United are desperate to sell off their unwanted players in the summer transfer window, in order to help fund a rebuild under Ruben Amorim. Sancho had appeared to be the most straightforward deal, with Chelsea lumbered with an obligation to buy the 25-year-old, only for the move to break down.",
      "He has now joined the list of other unwanted players United must find buyers for, which also includes fellow loanees Marcus Rashford and Antony, and wantaway winger Alejandro Garnacho. Keeping Sancho for the 2025/26 campaign under Amorim is not a viable option, with ESPN reporting that he has no intention of pulling the United shirt on again.",
      "His stance matches that of Amorim, who doesn’t want him in his squad when the next season begins. Sancho returned five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea, helping them win the Conference League – a solid if unspectacular effort which won’t help their efforts to sell him.",
      "The report states that there is tentative interest from West Ham, although Sancho’s wages will be problematic. He has another year left on his contract with United, who are reluctant to buy out the winger in order to grease the wheels of his exit.",
      "Sancho has been a flop of significant proportions since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73m. He has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United over four years and has not come close to matching the potential shown at Dortmund.",
      "He was absolutely electric in Germany, where he managed 40 goals and 47 assists in 118 appearances for Dortmund, but has struggled to replicate that form in England. A potential move back to the Bundesliga was potentially on the cards with Bayer Leverkusen, until the club hired Erik ten Hag as manager to shut that door.",
      "Ten Hag fell out with Sancho over his apparent lack of effort in training at Carrington and it was the Dutchman who prompted his loan move back to Dortmund in January 2024.",

It also sees the moment where Amorim preferred to arrive at Old Trafford before being told he had to join United in January.",
      "The first transfer window of the summer is open until June 10, before the market once again becomes available to work in from June 16. United have already announced the arrival of Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal, but there remains plenty of work to do.",
      "Amorim is said to have seen his first months in the job as firefighting as United failed to earn European football. Now, the 40-year-old wants to see a fresh start.",

      "Bruno Fernandes’ wish for former Manchester United team-mate Donny van de Beek has come true, with the Dutchman saying he “finally feels like a footballer again” after leaving the Red Devils.",
      "Van de Beek arrived at Old Trafford in 2020 from Ajax in a £35million deal when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge. But he failed to set Old Trafford alight under the Norwegian, gradually losing confidence and form to the point where he couldn’t even establish himself once his former Ajax boss Erik ten Hag took the reins.",
      "The midfielder made 62 appearances across his miserable four-year spell at the club, which also included unsuccessful loan moves to Everton and Eintracht Frankfurt as United sought to recover some of his transfer fee.",
      "The 28-year-old finally escaped his United nightmare by joining La Liga side Girona last summer in a deal worth a reported £420,000, which could rise to £7.6m.",
      "It made him United's first high-profile departure of the Sir Jim Ratcliffe era, after the arrivals of sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox.",
      "After Van de Beek confirmed his move to Girona, his former United captain Fernandes delivered a touching message on social media. Fernandes’ four-word message read: \"You deserve the best,\" along with a red heart.",
      "The Portuguese, who joined in January before Van de Beek’s arrival in the Premier League, will now be glad to know that Van de Beek is enjoying his football again in Spain. The former Netherlands international made 35 appearances for Girona this season, including seven in the Champions League, while scoring three goals and assisting two in all competitions.",
      "Van de Beek opened up about rediscovering his form in December, telling Voetbal International: \"My role was played out at Manchester United, so at the beginning of this year I wanted to make minutes elsewhere.",
      "\"The choice for Germany seemed nice, and don't get me wrong, Eintracht Frankfurt is really a big and beautiful club, but I really was lost around there. I was a loan player for a few months and then it is very simple: then you just have to deliver from the first game and impress. But I just couldn't.",
      "\"I got that far, needed rhythm and a series of games, only that was simply not possible. The result was that I was going to drive myself crazy. I had to show what I could do in a competition, which made me do way too much and I got away from myself.\"",
      "Turning his attention to Girona, he added: \"I enjoy it again. The fun, enjoying the game. That is so important and I have missed that feeling for so long. I finally feel like a footballer again.",
      "\"I think I've made more minutes this season than added up in the past four years. That says enough. The good feeling is back, I feel confidence again and the sacred fire in me has been fueled. Finally.\"",
      "Fernandes had appeared to be nearing his own move away from United in recent weeks. Following the crushing Europa League final defeat by Tottenham, speculation grew that the playmaker was open to leaving United if a big offer came in for him this summer.",
      "Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal were said to have held progressive talks with his representatives, while Red Devils bosses were reportedly willing to cash in on their skipper, who turns 31 this year.",
      "But it has since emerged that Fernandes rejected Al-Hilal’s lucrative offer after mulling things over with his wife. Explaining his decision, Fernandes said: “It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "“Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship. But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions, and I feel capable of it.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "A Manchester United star was once banned for life for match fixing. After plying his trade with Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest, Enoch West made his way to the Red Devils in 1910.",
      "A prolific centre-forward, he racked up 72 goals in 166 appearances for United - but his heroic stint was marred with controversy after just five years. That's because in 1915, West and four of his team-mates, as well as three Liverpool players, were banned for life after being convicted of match-fixing.",
      "As many of those who received suspensions went off to fight for their country during the First World War, they saw them rescinded upon returning. However, West refused to adhere to the stipulation, and as a result, his ban stayed in place for 30 years before it was eventually lifted in 1945.",
      "The longest suspension in Football Association history, West never played professionally ever again, given he was 59 when his ban expired. And he is just one of a number of athletes who have been banned for one reason or another throughout their respective careers...",
      "Lou Vincent was handed a lifetime ban from playing cricket at any level, as well as entering any cricket ground or working in a professional coaching capacity in July 2014, after admitting to match-fixing offences. The New Zealand batter released an open letter which saw him admit to his \"dark secret\" which \"shamed\" not only himself, but also his country and the sport.",
      "After his suspension commenced, Vincent became a builder in Raglan. However, following a successful appeal in December 2023, his lifetime ban from domestic cricket was lifted, which allowed him to return to play and coach outside of the international game.",
      "One of the most famous cases of doping in sporting history, Lance Armstrong was handed a lifetime ban by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in 2012. As a result, the American - who won the Tour de France seven years in a row between 1999 and 2005 after recovering from testicular cancer - saw all of his major accomplishments on the roads and tracks of the world scrubbed from history.",
      "While Ben Johnson's rise to superstardom was unprecedented to say the least - breaking the 100-metre and 60-metre world records and winning a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul - his downfall was equally as shocking. The Canadian sprinter tested positive for Stanozolol after the Olympics, while he admitted to having used steroids in the past.",
      "As a result, Johnson was later banned for two years and stripped of his Olympic medal for doping offences. Despite a brief comeback in 1991, he was once again found guilty of doping just two years later, and was banned for life by World Athletics.",
      "One of the country's most idolised stars, South African Test Cricket captain Hansie Cronje was handed a lifetime ban from the sport in 2000. Cronje, alongside Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje and Pieter Strydom, was caught up in allegations of match-fixing, with the King Commission banning him from any involvement in cricket for life as a result.",
      "Despite challenging his ban the following year, his application was dismissed and he remained forbidden from competing in the sport.",
      "Liang Wenbo and Li Hang were among the snooker stars caught out in a widespread match-fixing ring in China, which rocked the sport in 2023. While eight others were suspended during the investigation, including 2025 World Snooker Champion Zhao Xintong, Liang and Li were deemed to have fixed matches, to have persuaded and encouraged others to fix matches, and to have bet on matches themselves.",
      "As a result, they each received lifetime bans. Zhao, meanwhile, was given a ban of one year and eight months, reduced from two-and-a-half years for early admissions of wrongdoing and his guilty plea. While the 28-year-old never rigged matches himself, he did accept charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on games himself.",

The club knows the importance of their business this off-season, after a dreadful debut campaign for Ruben Amorim, and are determined to get it right this time.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and will not play in the Champions League next season after losing the Europa League final against Tottenham. They are recruiting from a position of weakness, which makes their decisions even more important, amid the financial difficulties spelled out by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The Red Devils have made a positive start to the window by agreeing a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves. United will pay his full £62.5million release clause - and hope that his addition will encourage others to follow suit.",
      "In the meantime, they are negotiating the departures of some first-team players, knowing that offloading unwanted players will be just as important as recruiting new ones. Everyone in the squad is considered fair game, meaning there will be lots of incomings and outgoings this summer. Here are the latest pieces of news involving United.",
      "Manchester United have made one last attempt to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. An initial bid of £55m, comprised of £45m up front and £10m in add-ons, was rejected by the Bees, so United have upped their offer.",
      "They have now offered £55m plus £5m in add-ons for the Cameroon international, who banged in 20 Premier League goals last season. The offer appears to match Brentford's stated £60m valuation for Mbeumo.",
      "It would appear the final stumbling block in the move, given that the 25-year-old forward is keen to move to Old Trafford and has already agreed personal terms of around £200,000-a-week over a five-year contract with an option for an extra year.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres has been linked with a move to Manchester United, due to his relationship with his old Sporting boss Amorim, and he has now ruled out on summer transfer. When asked about moving back to Sweden, the 27-year-old striker told Swedish Vogue: “After living in a warm country, it would be difficult.\"",
      "Gyokeres is understood to be available for £60m from Sporting this summer, but Arsenal are considered to be front-runners, because they can offer Champions League football.",
      "However, the Gunners are still considering RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, so Gyokeres' move to north London is far from certain.",
      "Inter Milan are waiting to get their new manager in place before deciding on a potential move for Rasmus Hojlund. Inter boss Simone Inzaghi left the Italian giants to join Al-Hilal after their defeat in the Champions League final and his replacement isn't through the door yet.",
      "Cristian Chivu is poised to leave Parma to take over from Inzaghi and he will be given a say over a potential move for Hojlund. The Danish international has a good reputation in Serie A following his spell at Atalanta and could be offered a way out of Old Trafford.",
      "Inter will need new attackers, with Joaquin Correa and Marko Arnautovic set to depart. And Hojlund could fit the bill for Chivu, although there are suggestions he could prefer Parma star Ange-Yoan Bonny instead.",

      "But it appears the Swedish goal machine is now open to joining the Red Devils, despite the fact that they won't be playing Champions League football next season. No formal talks have been held between United and Sporting CP, but a reunion with Ruben Amorim now looks a genuine possibility, particularly with Arsenal focusing on a deal to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Gyokeres was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford in January, despite Amorim promising not to raid his old club for talent during the winter window. The Portuguese coach was as good as his word, but made no such promise about the summer transfer window.",
      "Gyokeres, who turned 27 on Wednesday, is reportedly available for around £60million - a fee significantly lower than the £85m release clause in his contract. Given that United spent £72m on Rasmus Hojlund in 2023, that asking price may feel like a bargain.",
      "However, agent fees and Gyokeres' wage demands will need to be taken into account as well. The striker has scored an astonishing 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, and despite currently earning just £39,000 per week at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, he is expected to seek a salary exceeding £250,000 per week.",
      "Only five current United players earn weekly wages of £250,000 or more. Of those, three - Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Casemiro - are likely to leave this summer, while the remaining two - Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount - have also been linked with exits.",
      "With Sir Jim Ratcliffe aiming to rein in spending amid ongoing PSR concerns, United may hesitate to meet Gyokeres' hefty demands. However, the chance to sign a striker of his calibre - especially with limited competition - could prove too tempting to ignore and a gamble worth taking.",
      "Top European sides such as Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City already have world-class centre forwards in place, while United's other Premier League rivals appear to be pursuing other options.",
      "Chelsea recently beat United to the signing of Ipswich striker Liam Delap, and although they remain in the market for another forward, Hugo Ekitike appears to be their primary target. Liverpool are reportedly eyeing the Eintracht Frankfurt star as well, potentially viewing him as a replacement for Darwin Nunez, who is expected to leave Anfield this summer.",
      "The Red Devils have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, and are looking to seal a similarly priced deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. However, with several departures anticipated across United's forward line this summer, there is room - both in the squad and on the wage bill - for further additions.",
      "Gyokeres could prove to be the ultimate statement signing - one capable of firing United back up the table following a truly dismal season. But as with so many things at Old Trafford these days, any move will require walking a financial tightrope. Whether it pays off or backfires, the consequences will be significant and unavoidable."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been warned the club will not accept another season of failure. United endured their worst season for half a century, failing to win silverware and missing out on European football for next season.",
      "It is only the second time that has happened in 35 years. Amorim's pitiful side finished 15th in the Premier League and blew a backdoor route to the Champions League and around £100million in revenue by losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "Despite that bleak season, United have already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5m deal and are closing in on the £60m capture of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Berrada said: \"We were proud to reach the final of the UEFA Europa League. But ultimately, we were disappointed to finish as runner-up in Bilbao.",
      "\"We had a difficult season in the Premier League, which we all know fell below our standards - and we have a clear expectation of improvement next season.\"",
      "Berrada told shareholders that United remain determined to provide new world class facilities for the manager and players, including a new state-of-the-art, 100,000-capacity stadium, built on land adjacent to Old Trafford.",
      "He added: \"We remain focused on infrastructure, with the redevelopment of our Carrington Training Complex continuing and on track, which will be the heart of our club, providing world class facilities for all our teams and our staff.",
      "\"We have also announced our aspiration to pursue a new 100,000 seat stadium, sitting at the heart of the regeneration of the Old Trafford area, which would be a catalyst for growth and investment in our local community.",
      "\"We are continuing to work with all the relevant stakeholders, including central Government, to support their vision for growth.\"",
      "United have undergone another restructure, with Jason Wilcox promoted to director of football and Dave Brailsford stepping back from the club. Chief executive Berrada is confident everything is in place for United to turn their fortunes around.",
      "“Yeah, I can't talk about specifics but I can say we have been planning for many months now,” Berrada told MUTV last week. “We were ready for all the different scenarios and now know what we need to do.",
      "“We have a very clear idea where we need to invest in the squad to improve. So Jason [Wilcox], his team and Ruben [Amorim] have been in talks, as I said, for many months. Now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent but, at the same time, with ambition.”"

      "Less than a week after opening, the summer transfer window will temporarily close again as soon as Tuesday evening.",
      "As a result of the new Club World Cup format, the window opened earlier than usual to allow clubs participating in the tournament an exceptional registration period. The temporary closure, however, will last less than a week, with the window reopening on Monday, June 16.",
      "However, it does mean there will be a brief pause in transfer activity. For Manchester United, it means time is running out to get any more business done before the temporary halt in proceedings.",
      "United have come flying out of the traps at the start of this window, securing the services of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last Sunday, before setting their sights on Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United had an opening offer of £45million with a further £10m in add-ons knocked back in midweek after it fell short of Brentford's valuation. It is understood talks remain ongoing and a fresh offer is expected.",
      "On the presumption United get a deal over the line for Mbeumo, focus must then shift to outgoings. Mbeumo is likely to cost the Reds somewhere in the region of £60m, meaning their summer spending will smash through the £120m barrier after just two signings, with Cunha setting United back by £62.5m.",
      "United still need to strengthen a handful of other areas within their squad this summer, including in goal, in midfield and up front. A striker has to be the main priority.",
      "Regardless of what happens in terms of incomings, United always planned to be active in the seller's market - and that stance has not changed. They want to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priorities, while fellow wide man Alejandro Garnacho has also been told he can move on at the right price.",
      "United are understood to have valued at Rashford at £40m and they want around £32.5m for Antony, whose stock has risen in recent months thanks to his productive loan spell at Real Betis.",
      "United must find an alternative avenue in their quest to offload Sancho after Chelsea backed out of the obligation to sign the winger in a £25m deal. Chelsea paid a £5m penalty fee to break that agreement, but it means United now have the challenge of trying to find an alternative buyer.",
      "Sancho's wages are expected to be the biggest stumbling block in United's attempt to shift him, but they will still be keen to bank a fee in the region of the £25m Chelsea were originally expected to pay. If United are successful in their efforts to offload him, Rashford and Antony for the valuations they have set, they could secure almost £100m, which would be an excellent return for three players they have no plans to keep.",
      "United turned down a £40m bid for Garnacho from Napoli in January and will understandably want a higher fee this summer. Somewhere between £50m and £60m feels like a fair market value for the talented Argentine.",
      "If United can secure a fee within that region, they could find themselves securing a windfall in the region of £150m from just four sales. It is not as easy as simply ploughing the money straight back into the squad, with other operational costs and the £89m owed in transfer fees from previous windows to be considered, but it will give them a helping hand in their quest to recruit players for other positions in need of attention.",
      "As well as wanting to offload Rashford, Sancho, Garnacho and Antony, other departures are expected from Old Trafford. Tyrell Malacia is expected to leave permanently after three seasons at the club, Rasmus Hojlund is the subject of interest from Inter Milan and Casemiro is not assured of his future after United failed to qualify for Europe.",
      "Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir could also be sold amid Ruben Amorim's eagerness to recruit a new goalkeeper, while Luke Shaw is another player United should be looking to try and offload, though his injury record may put suitors off.",
      "The transfer market is one of the most unpredictable elements in football, meaning not everything United hope to achieve between now and the start of September will come to fruition. However, their intentions cannot be criticised.",
      "If they successfully offload the nine aforementioned players, particularly the star-studded names on the list, it will give them the best possible chance of making the additions they want."

      "Despite seeing an opening offer worth £55million turned down earlier this week, United are understood to remain in discussions with Brentford and an improved offer is expected to be submitted.",
      "The Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals this season, wants to move to Old Trafford despite being linked with the likes of Arsenal and Newcastle United, both of who have qualified for next season's Champions League.",
      "The prospect of United adding Mbeumo to the signing of Cunha will significantly strengthen their attacking options. Between them, the pair have scored 56 Premier League goals since the start of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "Mbeumo would also provide United with a versatile profile. With that said, MEN Sport has looked at three ways the Reds could line up if they secure the 25-year-old's signature:",
      "The general consensus is that United are chasing Mbeumo's signature with the idea of deploying him as the right-sided No.10 in Ruben Amorim's trademark 3-4-2-1 formation. He has played predominantly as a right-winger throughout his time at Brentford, but he often drifts inside to take up threatening positions.",
      "Amid that trait and his goalscoring record, he is a suitable fit for the right-sided No.10 role. He is also left-footed, and Amorim has gone on record he saying he prefers a left-footed player operating in that position.",
      "Should Mbeumo sign and be deployed on the right of the attack, Amad will almost certainly start from right wing-back. As far as the attack is concerned, Cunha is expected to be a shoo-in as the left-sided No.10, meaning the central position should be filled by the addition of a new striker.",
      "United are yet to confirm in which direction their hunt for a striker will head in after missing out on Liam Delap, but they continue to be linked with Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres. Amorim knows him inside out and he would be a dream signing.",
      "It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Mbeumo could play through the middle and spearhead United's attack. According to data specialists Transfermarkt, he played six times as a centre-forward for Brentford in 2024/25, scoring four goals.",
      "His reliability in front of goal, reflected in his tally of 38 Premier League strikes over the last three seasons, proves he is capable of playing up front. United have needed a multi-functional forward for several seasons and Mbeumo ticks that particular box.",
      "If United found themselves needing to deploy Mbeumo up front, they would not be light on options to fill the right-sided No.10 position with the likes of Mason Mount, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Joshua Zirkzee and Amad all capable of playing in that role.",
      "In games United are expected to dominate and dictate, Amorim may find himself feeling tempted to cram as many attack-minded players onto the pitch as possible, and could task Mbeumo with operating from right wing-back.",
      "Praised by Brentford boss Thomas Frank for his attitude and application and approach to defending, Mbeumo is unlikely to shy away from tracking back and contributing defensively. He is renowned for his commitment and willingness to give everything for the cause.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo operating out wide would allow Amad to play further forward and occupy the right-sided No.10 position. The Ivorian has flexed his muscles as both a wing-back and a No.10 since Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "If Amorim was sticking with the plan of trying to unleash as many attack-minded players as possible, and United do not sign the striker they crave, Cunha could be tasked with leading the line in this particular instance, such is his versatility, and Fernandes could play higher up the pitch."

      "The worst-case scenario around Manchester United's summer transfer window appears to have eased for now. Defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in Bilbao had fans fearing a bargain basement window, so the intent shown in trying to put together deals totalling £120million in the first week of business is encouraging.",
      "Missing out on European football left a £100million blackhole in the club's budget for next season, but their position with regards to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR) is better than expected, as shown by the desire to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo before the June 30 cut-off for the latest accounts to be submitted.",
      "That date acted as a second transfer deadline last summer, with clubs close to a breach desperately trying to sell academy graduates to ease concerns about a points deduction. Newcastle, Aston Villa, Chelsea, and Everton all cashed in, often trading with each other.",
      "United won't need to be part of that murky merry-go-round this month. Instead, the focus is on spending and the financial results posted on Friday for the first three months of 2025 hinted at an improving picture.",
      "Revenues were up, costs were down, and the situation looked an awful lot rosier than Sir Jim Ratcliffe had made it sound back in March, when he told people the club was going to run out of money by the end of the year.",
      "The club's financial crisis has been boosted by the 25% reduction in wages amongst the first-team squad for failing to qualify for the Champions League, which will carry over into next season. Savings are also being realised on the 250 or so staff made redundant last year, with a further 200 losing their jobs this year.",
      "That offers a better financial outlook at Old Trafford, but club bosses are still preaching caution. They talk of \"disciplined\" spending in this window and a desire to ensure costs continue to fall, building a stronger foundation for the club's long-term financial health.",
      "There are a couple of other factors at play in this window, and they are linked. Firstly, as Ratcliffe confirmed in that round of interviews in March, United will spend around £89million in transfer fee instalments this window, naming Andre Onana, Casemiro, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund as players who would cost money this summer, with fees still due to their former clubs.",
      "That kind of credit card dealing isn't unusual now, but United have taken it to extremes, with more than £300million owed on players they have 'signed' in recent windows. They took the same approach in the deal for Cunha, splitting his £62.5million release clause over three instalments.",
      "They are likely to continue to pursue that approach, given that cash reserves are one area where the business is continuing to struggle. Any sales might boost that figure, but the March 31 accounts showed cash available was down to £73.2million, a fall of £22.5million in those three months.",
      "While there is a revolving credit facility United can call on, as of March 31, it had an outstanding balance of £210million and a limit of £300million, so it doesn't add much to the pile.",
      "That's why this window promises to be a fascinating one for United. In theory, their financial position is better than expected, and sales can boost the funds available to them. But they are also constrained about how much cash they can actually spend.",
      "So, as the club pushes ahead with plans to revamp Amorim's squad, expect more negotiations in which the focus isn't necessarily on the fee but on its structure and how long United will have to pay it off."

      "However, after announcing last month that he will be leaving Lille when his contract expires at the end of June, the Canadian will soon become a free agent, meaning one club will secure the signature of one of Europe's most prolific goalscorers for nothing.",
      "David joined Lille from Belgian club Gent in 2020 and over his five seasons established himself as one of the most reliable goalscorers in the business, scoring 109 goals in 232 games.",
      "Scoring 51 times since the beginning of the 2023/24 campaign, David's stock is the highest it has ever been, meaning it is hardly surprising he has been linked with a plethora of big-name clubs from across Europe in recent months, including Manchester United, Liverpool, Newcastle United, Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "With a little over three weeks remaining on his contract at Lille, it has been claimed by Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport that David would 'prefer' a move to one of United, Barcelona or PSG.",
      "United, of course, are desperate to sign a striker this summer and signing David on a free transfer would make sense after spending £62.5million on Matheus Cunha. Bryan Mbeumo may also arrive from Brentford for a similar fee.",
      "However, United are unable to offer the attraction of Champions League football for next season. On the flip side, Barcelona and PSG can offer prospective summer signings that luxury.",
      "But as the addition of Cunha and the potential arrival of Mbeumo have proven, the absence of Champions League football is not the be all and end all for United, who have clearly not lost their pulling power. Mbeumo has attracted interest from Newcastle, who will be back in the Champions League next season, but he wants to join United.",
      "David impressed in the Champions League for Lille this season, scoring seven goals and claiming two assists in 10 appearances. With such an impressive record to shout about, he would be forgiven for wanting to join a club that will participate in Europe's premier club competition in 2025/26.",
      "However, he has, on more than one occasion, outlined his desire to experience playing in the Premier League, meaning that could give United a fighting chance of landing one of Europe's most sought-after strikers.",
      "Speaking back in 2022, David said: \"In England, when I watch the matches, everything is full each time. As a player, it motivates you even more.",
      "\"I don't know, I think it's possible, very possible [I could play in England one day]. I don't know if I can find myself anywhere other than the Premier League. It could well be the Premier League. It's a very nice atmosphere.\"",
      "In an earlier interview with The Guardian in April 2020, the 25-year-old admitted: \"The Premier League is the best in the world and most competitive so obviously that is somewhere I would love to play in the future.\"",
      "Taking David's admission into account, United may never get a better opportunity to lure him to England. His hunger to play in the Premier League could convince him to give up European football for one season in the hope of spearheading United's attack and firing them back into the European conversation for 2026/27.",
      "Of course, Barcelona and PSG are more attractive options than United are right now, not least because they won their respective league titles this season and PSG won the Champions League, but David's desire to play in England could sway his thinking.",
      "From United's point of view, they will not find a more prolific goalscorer for free. His record of 25 goals or more in each of the last three seasons proves that."

      "Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has kept the football world on their toes since the final home match of the season and has been heavily linked with a transfer to Manchester United.",
      "Following the victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Villa Park, a clearly emotional Martinez bid farewell to the home supporters. This was seen by many as a sign that he could be moving on to pastures new during the summer transfer window.",
      "Since then United, who have had a turbulent relationship with Andre Onana this season, have reportedly been making enquiries about the 32-year-old goalkeeper. With this is mind, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at what we know about Martinez's transfer situation.",
      "After joining up with the Argentinian national team this month, Martinez was asked about his future and whether it would be at Villa Park or not. A clearly guarded Martinez replied: \"My future? I don’t know.",
      "\"I’m here to play for the national team, and that’s all I care about right now. Do I want to change clubs? The transfer market has just opened, so there’s still a lot to happen.\"",

      "It was decided at that time that a move would not be viable but United have now decided to return to the race for his signature. The article also adds that Barcelona have sounded out a move for Martinez and they admit a deal could be tough due to Aston Villa's asking price.",
      "The reason why Villa's asking price could be so high is that Martinez remains firmly under contract at Villa Park. The Argentine has four years remaining on his current deal and thus Unai Emery's men can place whichever price tag they want on the shot stopper.",
      "For United, this is an issue if they want to sign him soon as they need to green light exits before spending big.",
      "Coincidentally, Martinez's potential last match in Villa colours came against United at Old Trafford. The goalkeeper did not cover himself in glory though as he charged into Rasmus Hojlund to earn himself a straight red card.",

It also marks the moment when Amorim had initially hoped to join Old Trafford, before being informed he would have to wait until January.",
      "The initial summer transfer window remains open until 10 June, before reopening for business from 16 June. United have already confirmed the signing of Matheus Cunha in a deal worth £62.5million, but there is plenty of work to be done.",

      "Following the acquisition of Cunha, United are now looking to sign Bryan Mbeumo. The Cameroon international is eager to make the move, although United still need to reach an agreement with Brentford.",
      "It seems that departures may be more crucial for maintaining a stable environment under Amorim's management. Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony are all available for transfer, while Alejandro Garnacho also faces an unclear path ahead.",

      "Manchester United have wasted no time in getting down to business at the start of this summer's transfer window.",
      "After completing the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last weekend, United are now trying to get a deal in place to bring Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford.",
      "After seeing an opening offer worth £55m turned down in midweek, discussions between the two clubs are understood to remain ongoing and an improved bid is expected to be made.",
      "Having already signed Cunha, who scored 17 goals across all competitions in 2024-25, the prospect of United adding Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals, to their attacking pool is exciting.",
      "United's attack was blunt for much of the 2024/25 campaign, so the fact they could start next season with two of the Premier League's most consistent recent goalscorers in their attack is extremely encouraging.",
      "Should Mbeumo join Cunha at Old Trafford, the general feeling is they will occupy the two No.10 positions. Cunha regularly operated as the left-sided No.10 in a 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, while Mbeumo has often drifted inside from the right flank at Brentford.",
      "United's switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation under Ruben Amorim last November means Cunha's transition to Old Trafford should be fairly seamless. He is a specialist in the No.10 role and the uniqueness of Amorim's formation means that he needs specialist operators to occupy key positions within it.",
      "Despite Cunha and potentially Mbeumo also offering United a sense of versatility, which chief executive Omar Berrada vowed the club would target this summer, Cunha's experience as a No.10 makes him a tailor-made fit for the role Amorim wants him to fill.",
      "And signing specialist players for specific positions is a route former United manager Jose Mourinho wanted to go down in the 2016 summer transfer window, while also acknowledging the importance of having players who could also play in different roles.",
      "\"We made a nucleus of four priorities, four positions, to give a certain balance to the squad,\" Mourinho said in July 2016. \"To give a certain push in terms of the qualities I need and want.",
      "\"As you know, the ones with more vision. I am more a manager that likes specialists rather than multi-functional players because I am clear in my approach.",
      "\"Multi-functional players – you need one or two if you have three central defenders injured. But, basically, I want specialists.\"",
      "United's early-window recruitment has given a clear indication that Amorim is after both specialists and a sprinkling of versatility. Multi-functional forwards have been missing from United's attacking ranks in recent years, making the addition of Cunha and the potential addition of Mbeumo extremely positive.",
      "However, Cunha, despite being capable of playing as a No.9, is, first and foremost, a specialist No.10, who will slot straight into the left-sided No.10 position. He is a maverick, capable of making something happen in the blink of an eye from that particular area of the pitch.",
      "The unique nature of Amorim's system means he will need specialist operators, hence why he was so determined to sign Patrick Dorgu back in January to operate at wing-back. He cannot rely on attempting to put square pegs in round holes."

      "United signed Cunha for £62.5m after activating his Wolves release clause and Brentford are expected to demand a similar fee for Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals this season. It means if they are successful in their efforts to sign Mbeumo, two attacking signings will set them back around £120m.",
      "After failing to qualify for next season's Champions League, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as it would have been, putting even more pressure on the club to flex their muscles in the seller's market. Departures could reach double figures and United have identified a crop of players they want to move on as priorities.",
      "To complicate matters further and put more strain on United's finances, it should not be forgotten that the club owes £89m in transfer fees this summer for players they signed in previous windows, meaning the prospect of signing Mbeumo in addition to Cunha could see their spending eclipse the £200m mark after landing just two new arrivals, albeit those fees will likely be amortised across the length of their contracts.",
      "Speaking to Gary Neville for Sky back in March, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said: \"If you look at the players that we will buy this summer that we did not buy, in other words, we're paying for, that it is, we're buying Antony this summer. We're buying [Jadon] Sancho this summer, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana.",
      "\"It's not a light switch. In your day [Neville's], you bought a player and that was it. I know that the bill we will pay this summer is £89m for players that have been signed previously. If we buy no players, we write a cheque for £89m this summer.\"",
      "It is not uncommon for clubs to pay transfer fees in instalments, covering several years, just as United are doing in Cunha's case, but the club has been guilty of paying over the odds in recent years, meaning they are still paying the price for underwhelming and failed signings.",
      "For example, if United sign Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m, their outgoings before sales will stand at around £210m, putting immense pressure on themselves to flex their muscles in the seller's market as quickly as possible.",
      "Mbeumo will almost certainly be United's final incoming before they can think about signing anyone else, with the club desperately in need of overseeing a collection of departures.",
      "United have prioritised the sales of Marcus Rashford, Sancho and Antony while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave at the right price. Rashford is valued at £40m, Sancho was originally expected to join Chelsea for around £25m and Antony is set to be available for around £32.5m.",
      "If United successfully offload those three for the valuations they have set, they will bank just under £100m, meaning their departures would cover the £89m they owe in transfer fees for previous signings. Napoli had a £40m bid for Garnacho knocked back in January, meaning United are likely to request upwards of £50m for him.",
      "However, until clubs come knocking in pursuit of the players United are actively trying to offload, incomings risk grinding to a halt.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim, like all coaches, will want the bulk of his business done early, meaning United will have to try and push sales through as quickly as they can. Without departures, there is only so much they will be able to do this summer."

The former Sunderland man has occupied the only role tougher than that of United goalkeeper for a considerable period of time - England's No.1.",
      "After a shaky start, Pickford has grown into the role and clearly has the experience to handle the big occasion that would be thrust at him if he were to move to Old Trafford. Arguably, United would be able to negotiate a cheaper deal for Pickford, as Martinez has four years remaining on his contract, while the Everton shot-stopper has just two years remaining.",
      "Everton's move to Bramley Moore Docks could make things harder for United with Pickford, perhaps, keen to play at their new stadium. But, if United are going to invest their time trying to convince a goalkeeper to sign, then the 31-year-old England number one may make more sense than Martinez."

      "Manchester United have wasted no time in trying to make their mark on this summer's transfer window.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last Sunday, United are now attempting to secure the signature of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After discovering the Cameroonian is keen on a move to Old Trafford, United tabled an opening offer for the 25-year-old in midweek, understood to be worth £55million, but it was rejected. However, they are understood to remain in talks with the Bees and a revised offer is expected.",
      "Having signed Cunha for £62.5m, Brentford are expected to demand a similar fee for their talisman, who plundered 20 Premier League goals this season. He is an established top flight operator and United want to sign players who can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "It is understood United have recruited Cunha, 26, to operate in the left-sided No.10 position, meaning Mbeumo is being targeted with the expectation of operating from the right-sided No.10 position. United also remain determined to sign a striker to operate down the middle.",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's appointment last November, United immediately transitioned to a 3-4-2-1 system, meaning the two roles previously reserved for the wingers are now occupied by attacking-midfielders.",
      "As a result of United's plan to cut their cloth this summer, the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who are all natural wingers, have been prioritised. Fellow winger Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed he can leave.",
      "The only winger who does have a future at United is Amad. He quickly got to grips with the responsibility of being a wing-back and flexed his muscles as a No.10, meaning he has a key part to play in Amorim's plans.",
      "But with United now attempting to add Mbeumo to their pool of attackers, the expectation is that Amad's long-term position could be at right wing-back. Mbeumo, however, is also capable of playing up front, meaning that could open up a window of opportunity for Amad to start in a more advanced role.",
      "Cunha, however, is a specialist No.10. That means Bruno Fernandes looks increasingly likely to be tasked with pulling the strings from the centre of midfield.",
      "But while he and Amad have alternative roles they may find themselves occupying in Amorim's first-choice XI, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount do not necessarily have that same guarantee.",
      "Mainoo has struggled to nail down a place in the team this calendar year, regularly finding himself flittering between the centre of midfield and either of the two No.10 positions. His profile as a forward-thinking midfielder means the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield risks leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Injuries hindered Mainoo's chances of settling into any form of rhythm under Amorim, meaning many believe he has not yet had a fair opportunity to flex his muscles in a 3-4-2-1 system. Many believed Amorim's appointment would mark the beginning of a long-term midfield partnership with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "However, Cunha's arrival means Fernandes is almost certainly going to occupy one of the two No.8 positions. Ideally, he needs a defensive-minded operator next to him to allow him to play his natural game and advance into attacking positions.",
      "It means Mainoo is not guaranteed a regular starting berth next season, likewise Mount. Despite being signed from Chelsea two years ago to operate in a three-man midfield, he is much more effective in Amorim's system when occupying one of the two No.10 roles.",
      "He started the final four games of this season, including the Europa League final, as the left-sided No.10, highlighting where Amorim sees his long-term future. However, Cunha's arrival and the possibility of Mbeumo being added to the equation means he may not be a regular starter come August.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is another member of the current squad who is at his best when playing as a No.10. After failing to make his mark as a No.9, his performances improved once he was tasked with operating slightly deeper and linking the midfield with the attack.",
      "With all of that mind, United could find themselves with Cunha, Mbeumo, Fernandes, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee and Amad all pushing for starts in either of the two No.10 positions.",
      "Seven into two, of course, doesn't go, meaning Amorim and the United hierarchy may have to make some tough decisions. Only Fernandes and Amad have alternative roles where they could realistically remain guaranteed starters."

      "Perhaps an unpopular opinion but there is definitely still time for Rasmus Hojlund to come good at United. However, that will not come while he remains the lead striker at this football club.",
      "United must add at least one centre-forward to their squad this summer. Viktor Gyokeres or Victor Osimhen could prove to be astute acquisitions but whoever signs needs to be ready to be the main man for Amorim next season.",
      "Christian Eriksen's exit, while he was not one of the most important players, has left a gap in the midfield. Casemiro is not the future of this team's midfield and United need someone to partner Manuel Ugarte who Amorim appears to trust.",
      "An outside purchase could be the answer here. They could look from within to do that though and speaking of that solution...",
      "Kobbie Mainoo remains one of United's best academy prospects, and yet there is a scenario where selling him makes more sense than the current turbulent situation that the Reds find themselves in. Under Amorim, it feels like there isn't a position where he fits seamlessly.",
      "This summer, United need decide do they find a way to fit Mainoo into Amorim's system or do they sell him and add further funds to the budget. Unusually, there is no right or wrong answer.",
      "It seems unlikely that Andre Onana will be sold this summer and if that's the case, Altay Bayindir will likely leave. To replace the Turkish shot stopper, United cannot look to another second choice who is not consistent enough nor has the ability to compete with Onana.",
      "The lack of competition has only hindered the Cameroonian. Bayindir's replacement needs to be a goalkeeper who can compete with Onana - Emiliano Martinez could be that option, albeit he has not always endeared himself with the United fanbase.",
      "Harry Maguire, like a lot of players in this squad, is not going to be the future. His deal expires in 2026 and there is a scenario where he leaves.",
      "Should that possibility be likely, United need to be planning now for life without Maguire. A sixth centre-back is needed considering Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof's departures.",
      "Perhaps Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi is an option for United. He would add that much-needed calmness to the defence that the Reds crave and he already has experience of playing at the toughest stage."

      "Both could conceivably play as the centre-forward, but with the former coming in as a playmaker to accompany Liam Delap, before the England under-21 international signed for Chelsea, that was seemingly not their initial plan. Mbeumo has played as a striker, but more often in a 3-5-2 alongside another forward, such as Yoane Wissa.",

A club in limbo? A club in purgatory waiting for the final sentencing – Levy growing like the Genie in Aladdin, great swirling dark clouds filled with acid rain, ready to flood the club once again in his mediocrity.",
      "I know, I know – chill out, but we’ve seen this film far too often to think otherwise.\nDan",
      "",
      "Farewell to a Spurs legend\nI think we all knew it was coming, but the news breaking still hurt:",
      "The Ange era is over at Spurs.",
      "Many fans were sick of him. Many in the media and from other clubs ridiculed him. But I’m very much one of the many Spurs fans who was inspired by Ange Postecoglou, who’s grateful for his time at the club, and who will genuinely miss him as the leader of the team.",
      "Modern football has hooked us all. Most of us caught the bug when we were young, and now we’re eternally afflicted.",
      "But as time has gone by, the clubs are changing – every day the clubs become more like modern commercial franchises, and the players often become more like celebrity megastars, rather than clubmen. This is all very normal, and not necessarily wrong, but sometimes it can make it less magnetic to be so invested in your team, and a group of players.",
      "After Poch, through no conscious choice, I found myself tuning out of Spurs a bit. Nothing major, just reading about them less often, fewer podcasts, watching fewer games. I cared less when we lost. I remember very little from the Mourinho Era, and nothing from Nuno.",
      "Conte piqued my interest, but like many, I was as jaded as he was by the end of his tenure.",
      "And then came Ange.",
      "(Largely) unheralded, ‘unproven’ at the top level. As Daniel Levy even put it “We tried bringing in winners, but now we’ve got Ange.”",
      "But he came with a vision of changing Spurs. He had no interested being a mercenary coming in for a quick buck, and jumping for a bigger job. He wasn’t aloof and above us. This was a man who was excited by the challenge: Taking an iconic club, who’s spent far too long away from success, and rewiring the whole culture and style of the club, to make us an exciting, winning football team again. In the modern world of football, having someone like this with a vision, and a passion – you couldn’t help but be swept up with it.",
      "An absolute breath of fresh air.",
      "You could see from the beginning, not only the fans loved ‘Angeball’ – the players loved it too. No longer were they told that they were ‘just Tottenham’. It was now “We’re Spurs, mate!” And the player played with a pride and vigour I hadn’t seen in years.",
      "After a beautiful first 10 games, what followed was 19 months of lunacy. A scattering of brief, glorious highs amidst a torrent of abject awful defeats. Crazy injuries, suspensions, shapeless formations, batterings. Following Spurs under Ange for 2 years probably aged me 10.",
      "But even still, it was exciting. Exciting to see a manager who trusted his vision, and a group of players who trusted that manager.",
      "MORE POSTECOGLOU SACK REACTION\n👉 England manager Thomas Tuchel speaks out after Tottenham’s ‘horrible’ Ange Postecoglou sacking\n👉 Five next move options for Ange Postecoglou post-Tottenham sack include Leeds United, Everton\n👉 Spurs face ‘player revolt’ over Ange sack as ‘so angry’ stars seek exit in aftermath of brutal decision",
      "Now let’s be fair: Ange wasn’t perfect. In January this year, many would say he should’ve been sacked with Spurs floundering in the league. Ange knew the writing on the wall, and he had to make a choice: If he pulled up his socks, and bet the house on recovering in the league, he probably could have got Spurs to a somewhat respectable 9th or 10th (remember, they could’ve finished as high as 14th on the final day). But Ange knew that would achieve nothing: He’d lose his job anyway, and more importantly, he’d have left no impact on Spurs – just another grey, forgettable season.",
      "So he went full rogue, threw the Premier League out the window and bet the house on doing the one thing that could change the entire mentality (and modern history) of Tottenham: Winning the Europa League.",
      "Ange gave Spurs fans and players one of the greatest experiences they’ll have in a lifetime of football. Arsenal fans can whinge about second tier trophies or whatever, but it doesn’t matter. Those players remember the feeling on the pitch, and those fans remember the parade, the confetti, the noise in Bilbao. Incredible.",
      "Ange leaves now with his head held high. He leaves with promises kept (He always wins things in his second season, mate) and have no doubt, he’ll rightly lap up all the credit for years to come on being the man who conquered the Spurs curse.",
      "Is it the right decision to move on? As an Ange fan, I have to say no. I think getting rid of Ange will send negative ripples through the team – he’s a leader to those players and they love him. He’s brought them the success he promised. It’s a huge challenge for whoever comes next.",

      "Is Badwolf really just the Utd version of Stewie? So Bruno doesn’t want to go to Saudi Arabia and waste his life playing meaningless football in a joke league (look at how many goals Ronaldo is still scoring). Everyone else gets slated for moving there but god forbid Bruno doesn’t. I say fair play for not selling his soul.",
      "We don’t need the money – if you actually look how Utd finances work Big Jim was vastly overstating our position and, for now, can still afford to keep him. Especially if we sell some of the redundant homegrown players but even if not.",
      "Rashford had one good season. He was possibly the most selfish player in the league, and one worldie pass doesn’t change that. He isn’t wanted because he just isn’t that good, and his attitude stinks.",
      "As for Mount…how do you replace a player who is there week in, week out with a player who is never actually fit? Maybe BW wants us to play with 10 men and a permacrocked waste of money.",
      "Bruno has been, without question, our best player since he joined. He might be a moaner, but so was Keane. I get opposition fans railing on him, as we do to their players, but maybe actually stand by the team and stick up for our players?",
      "Whether he should be captain is a different question, but his numbers in a shambles of a team have been, year in and year out, world class, and if you want to state otherwise provide actual proof to the contrary instead of just moaning.",

      "",
      "The ‘crying little weakling’\nI know that I’m late to the subject on Bruno but I would just like to say this…the reason why people (football fans) don’t like Bruno and see him as an arm waving, selfish, whiny baby despite his great effort on the pitch, his consistency (compare availability with similar attacking midfielder like Odegard who seems to be injured all the time or Palmer who is talented but volatile), leadership skills- he does organize Man Utd’s play, defensive skills and clear motivation towards achieving victory for his team(his stats tell it all-he is truly world class) is simple.",
      "He is not handsome(appealing) enough to tempt most football fans.He does not appeal to football fans the way they would with other players in the same position, he displays a guilty face whenever he misses a chance or when he makes a mistake.",
      "He parades himself as the one responsible for any failure on the pitch that leads to defeat and seems almost about to cry (for  contrast-compare Vieira/Keane reaction to a mistake,they were either angry or keen on making amends-which is highly appealing to fans).",
      "Bruno is not stoic, he displays his feelings and weaknesses for everyone to see(compare this with other players-even Martin “amateur photographer” Odegard doesn’t display himself that much). This ultimately opens him to criticism,with fans seeing only a weak, guilty, whiny face.",
      "This coupled with inability to achieve victory for his team makes him a very ripe target because as much as we(football fans) may like to deny it, it is inescapable to admit that football is a cosmetic sport-we like the tough guy displays(Vieira, Keane-their manly fights), the electrifying displays(both Ronaldos, Henry-that goal against Liverpool, Hazard, Ribery), the man against all odds display(Wayne Rooney-that overhead kick, Vardy, Fabio cannavaro-a dwarf who rose above giants to claim victory), the stoic display(Tony Adams,Paolo Maldini and to a lesser extent Virgil).",
      "Bruno is ugly because he presents himself as a crying little weakling who is seeking our pity for his losses.\nJamo, Nairobi.",
      "",
      "I think he is a really bad player and a bully. He has bad technique gives the ball away more than any other midfielder in the league. He controls the game to make himself look good. He is a crybaby, cheats a lot with fouls.",
      "He is the reason united have done so badly. I thought he was a fake from the first day he arrived at united, he has really dragged them into the gutter. No united striker will score with Bruno in the team, he is supposed to be the creator but it’s something he simply can’t do he might get lucky once in a while but it’s all luck.",
      "United please sell him. Compare him to any player in his position and you will find he is the worst , hang on what is Bruno’s position\nDerrick",

      "I’d love to say it was only in France, but while I’m sure it happens elsewhere (in particular Spain) it also happens in our own fair country. Mazraoui (I’m sure he wasn’t the only player in the country) refused to wear Pride-supporting clothing on more than one occasion while at United and as a result the whole side didn’t either, presumably “in solidarity”. What about solidarity with people being abused for existing?!?",
      "I am fully accepting of people having the right to not wear something; tolerating other people’s beliefs is important. But why should a community be shunned rather than supported because one member has beliefs that don’t align with the general accepted view. At least in France it was those players that stood alone and will be punished alone.",
      "If you don’t want to stand against x or y behaviour that is widely accepted as bad, then don’t play that match (and frankly, what are clubs doing giving these guys money if they’re pro-homophobia or anti equal rights). It doesn’t correspond to your personal beliefs? Ok, your choice, but they should be the ones out of step with the rest, not the rest align *with* them.",

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for three of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history each, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "19) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",
      "",
      "20) Robert Sanchez – £20m/€23m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nWhile not the signing Chelsea most desperately wanted from Brighton, they nevertheless did not return empty-handed from their protracted Moises Caicedo negotiations as Sanchez headed to Stamford Bridge to provide competition for the No.1 entry on this list. Chelsea have obviously put him up for sale again.",

      "As such, Caught Offside suggests they are looking to replace Sancho, and could do so with his United team-mate. Indeed, they state Chelsea ‘remain’ interested in Alejandro Garnacho.",

      "The winger is said to be a ‘tempting option’ for Chelsea given he fits their philosophy of signing ‘elite young talents for their long-term project’.",
      "But, the Blues both have competition for Garnacho – with Napoli, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all after him – and are looking at another exciting forward themselves.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘desperately searching’ for a buyer for a flop signing, as they have been torn to pieces by former coach Rene Meulensteen, who labelled his signing “stupid business.”",
      "United have just completed their worst season in Premier League history. Never before have they finished as low as 15th in the table.",
      "Some players ended the season with credit in the bank, though they were largely the ones who were not actually representing United. Indeed, Antony headed out on loan to Real Betis for half the season, where he scored nine goals and assisted five.",
      "It was felt that might have put him in contention for a place back at United, though GIVEMESPORT states Antony ‘still has no future’ under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Indeed, it’s stated the club are ‘desperately searching for a buyer’ for the winger. Their preference is to offload him permanently, and United will ask for just £30million in order to do that.",
      "They have, though, refused to rule out a loan with an obligation to buy if no buyers come forward before the back end of the window, and it’s felt Betis have a ‘golden opportunity’ to land Antony on loan again after his first period there.",
      "Former United coach Meulensteen, who was Sir Alex Ferguson’s right-hand man, is in agreement that Antony should not return.",
      "“I wouldn’t bring Antony back because I’ve seen enough of him that he’s not cut out for the club and not good enough,” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",
      "“His performances are fuelled by his personality and are not for the good of the team, he’s selfish. You will never get your £80m back from Antony. I thought it was stupid business at the time when I heard it was happening.",
      "“I know that when they heard about the deal in Amsterdam, they were doing cartwheels. It shows again that players in those lower leagues, like Holland, are completely different. They’re playing very different styles, a slower tempo.",
      "“Teams like Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are the best, so it’s easy for them to look good.",
      "“But coming into the Premier League is so much different. What is Antony’s return? How many goals and assists has he got? He’s probably got as many, if not more, in Spain than in England, that different kind of football is more ideal for him.”",
      "Another player United are willing to sell, Alejandro Garnacho, has not impressed Meulensteen.",
      "“Garnacho is the same as Antony. Yes, he’s a young boy but, personality-wise, some things are not right with him and he’s bad for the club. That shows in his performances and lack of consistency.",
      "“He’s a young player who has good value to him, so if they were to get offered any sort of money, they should cut their losses, because he isn’t going to live up to his potential at Old Trafford and that can free up some money to spend elsewhere.”",
      "According to reports, a ‘decision’ has been made on Alejandro Garnacho as he ‘will leave’ Premier League giants Manchester United this summer.",
      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",
      "Ex-Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster has hit out at Alejandro Garnacho’s behaviour this season and thinks his haircut in the Europa League final summed him up.",
      "Jadon Sancho could replace Antony at Real Betis this summer as Man Utd set their price for the Brazilian, according to reports.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are interested in signing Man Utd centre-back Lisandro Martinez this summer as well as Alejandro Garnacho, according to reports.",
      "Gary Neville insists he’s “pretty certain” that Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho will all leave Man Utd this summer."

      "Selfish Bruno must go\nI see LOH has still not grasped the concept of “team player”. But first, since you mentioned Rashford, no one has said he was the bastion of great attitude *off* the pitch. Apparently, his main crime *on* the pitch is not being a pressing forward. If you’re going there, maybe we should castigate Bruno for not being able to tackle? I couldn’t give a rats about what a player does that isn’t illegal off the pitch. Garnacho apparently trains well. Shame he can’t deliver when it actually matters.",
      "I’m sure off the pitch Bruno is a model professional, but on the pitch he’s a whiny baby who will often prefer to shout at someone (referee, team mates, the sky, the grass) rather than get back into position or show for the pass. He spent a solid 30 seconds in one incident in the EL Final, when Maguire was desperately trying to pass to him, shouting at someone or other rather than paying any attention to the actual match actually going on and that we were losing to actual Spurs. If you don’t recall the match, it’s one of those “off” games that Bruno has occasionally – usually when we face anyone decent or who sit deep.",
      "Bruno was never world class. No (other?) big club has ever shown interest in him. He can create chances, as long as they mostly involve pinging the ball out wide. Down the middle, not so much. You want to give him huge credit for passing to Mainoo? It was decent for sure, but the movement by Mainoo for it (and the finish), and arguably the Rashford ping out to Garnacho, was better. The fact that this kind of pass is so unusual as to be worth mentioning is telling in itself.",
      "As far as selfish, yes, I stand by that. He’s missed as many big chances as he’s created all season, certainly in the league. Missed. Those were opportunities where a less selfish player would look for the pass to someone in a better position. I wonder where Garnacho got this “me first” attitude? Yes, he’s seemed to produce good numbers. In a team where he is the sole focus of creating chances. That he led to two of our worst finishes back to back. Brilliant!",
      "In the context of the club, yeah that’s a little tongue in cheek but it was him that said he would go if the club decided to let him. Then they let him, and he decided not to. Because HE doesn’t want to play at a lower level. And while I get that, he’s only going to be declining from here on. 31 when the season starts. Him staying has absolutely nothing to do with anyone else but his ego, just like his Hollywood passes.",
      "The sad thing is that this makes a problem for everyone else in the squad. Mainoo has been promised to play at 8 as a regular starter if he signs da ting. And we’re now signing two other 10s, with the supposed view that Amad moves to RWB.",
      "So, where does that leave the two new signings, and Mount. And Collyer. And Casemiro. Seems like once again Bruno was out the door – as it was when we signed Mount – only to turn around and come back in after he’s been replaced.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "12) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "13) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "14) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "15) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "16) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "17) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "18) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle.

      "Man Utd and Lisandro Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since he underwent surgery four months ago; defender is on an individual programme as he works to return to fitness after being stretchered off against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in February",
      "Saturday 7 June 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",

      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"
